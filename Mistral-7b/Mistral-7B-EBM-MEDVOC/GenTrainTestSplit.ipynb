Patients with dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), asymptomatic persistent transaminasemia lasting 24 weeks, and evidence of hepatic fat infiltration on ultrasonography and liver biopsy were studied. Those with predominant hypertriglyceridemia received omega-3 fatty acids (5 mL thrice daily) (Group A), those with predominant hypercholesterolemia received atorvastatin 20 mg/daily (Group B), and overweight patients received orlistat 120 mg thrice daily before meals (Group C). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum transaminase and lipid levels and liver ultrasonography were repeated. Serum transaminase levels decreased significantly (p< 0.001) in all groups but the decrease was more marked in Group C (AST 75 [16] to 31 [7] IU/L; ALT 120 [38] to 41 [10] IU/L) than in Group A (AST 70 [14] to 41 [6]; ALT 110 [20] to 68 [12]) or Group B (AST 68 [13] to 46 [9]; ALT 115 [22] to 76.6 [13]). After treatment, ultrasonography showed resolution of fatty liver in 35% of patients in Group A, 61% in Group B, and in 86% in Group C (p< 0.001, Group C vs. A). A decline in transaminase levels and normalization of ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver were observed on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, with atorvastatin in those with hypercholesterolemia, and orlistat in overweight patients with hyperlipidemia.\n",

Net proton fluxes were measured with a pH electrode, and halide fluxes were measured with 82Br- and 36Cl-. In membranes containing the secondary amine, a large net proton flux was produced either by a Br- gradient with symmetrical pH or by a pH gradient with symmetrical Br-, but not by a pH gradient in Br--free solutions. This H+ flux was electrically silent (nonconductive), and the H+ permeability coefficient was greater than 10(-3) cm sec-1 in 0.1 M NaBr. In Br--free solutions, H+ selectivity was observed electrically by measuring conductances and zero-current potentials generated by H+ activity gradients. The permeability coefficient for this ionic (conductive) H+ flux was about 10(-5) cm sec-1, several orders of magnitude smaller than the H+ permeability of the electroneutral pathway. Large electroneutral Br- exchange fluxes occurred under symmetrical conditions, and the permeability coefficient for Br- exchange was about 10(-3) cm sec-1 at pH 5. The one-way Br- flux was inhibited by substituting SO4= for Br- on the \"trans\" side of the membrane. These results support a \"titratable carrier\" model in which the secondary amine exists in three forms (C, CH+ and CHBr). Protons can cross the membrane either as CHBr (nonconductive) or as CH+ (conductive), whereas Br- crosses the membrane primarily as CHBr (nonconductive). In addition to these three types of transport, there is also a pH-dependent conductive flux of Br- which has a permeability coefficient of about 10(-7) cm sec-1 at pH 5. Experiments with lipid monolayers suggest that the pH dependence of this conductive flux is caused by a change in surface potential of about +100 mV between pH 9.5 and 5.0. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The creams were evaluated using the agar cup diffusion method in isosensitest agar. The peptone water solutions provided fractional inhibitory concentrations for combinations of the antibacterial substances. The test organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial uptakes of antibacterial combinations, determined by either an HPLC assay method or an atomic absorption method, combined with dry cell weight determinations, indicated that enhancement of activity of the antibacterial combinations against P. aeruginosa (two strains) and E. cloacae were related to marked increases in the bacterial uptake of the chemical agents. Decreases in activity were related to decreased uptake of either dibromopropamidine and/or silver ions. The effect of the trimethoprim and the sulfonamides was shown to depend on their effect on bacterial folate synthesis. It is suggested that partial blockade of the folate synthetic pathway leads to an effect on cell permeability which results in increased uptake of antibacterials. Dibromopropamidine isethionate also has an effect on cell permeability which produces an increased bacterial uptake of a second antibacterial present in the medium. These findings provide further explanation of how subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfonamide combinations are synergistic against a wide range of bacteria even when certain bacteria are resistant to either member of the combination. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The percentage of 3H-containing MTX products in the urine after 4 hr was considerably less, although more variable. This variability seemed to be related to variability in the amount of the total dose excreted. Non-MTX products were also found in selected tissues and the percentage of intact MTX found 4 hr after i.v. injection varied from 2 to 26%. The percentage of intact MTX was routinely measured by comparing the values obtained using the dihydrofolate reductase assay with values based on the specific activity of [3',5',9(n)-3H]MTX. Results obtained by diethylaminoethyl column chromatography on a few samples, however, showed good agreement with results from the reductase assay. [3',5',9(n)-3H]MTX products appeared in peaks eluting from the diethylaminoethyl column both earlier and later than the MTX peak, with the earlier peaks being present in only small amounts in the urine. After continuous i.v. infusion, only 2% or less of the radioactivity found in the cerebrospinal fluid after 4 hr represented intact MTX, with the remaining radioactivity eluting much earlier than MTX. In contrast, after direct injection into the left lateral ventricel, all the 3H radioactivity in both cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue represented intact MTX for up to 4 hr after injection. The appearance of MTX products in the plasma and selected tissues of these primates a short time after i.v. injection is compared to other work in experimental animals and man and suggests a greater metabolism of MTX than was previously suspected. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

As a predictor of diabetic nephropathy, urinary NAG was the most useful indicator among of them. Urinary gamma GTP had no clinical benefit on early detection of diabetic nephropathy although in cis-platin induced nephrotoxicity both urinary gamma GTP and NAG increased in parallel. Increase of urinary NAG appeared in diabetic patients prior to clinical proteinuria. With appearance of proteinuria, urinary NAG more increased. Urinary NAG correlated significantly with HbAlc and BMG in serum (sBMG). It is therefore needed for clinical application of urinary NAG as a predictor of diabetic nephropathy that control states of blood glucose in the patients should be considered. However, the results of sequential measurements of urinary NAG, sBMG and HbAlc in 78 diabetic patients for 18-month period showed that only urinary NAG was a responsible factor for elevation of sBMG known as an indicator of deterioration of renal function. These results indicate that renal tubular damage may already exist in early-stage of diabetic nephropathy, and that increase of urinary NAG activity is a useful predictor of diabetic nephropathy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

All three LA isolates were screened in vitro for anticholesteremic and antimicrobial activities. One strain, LA16, caused the greatest reduction in cholesterol and inhibited both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli the most. LA16 was used to produce 16, 18.9-liter quantities of acidophilus yogurt (AY), over a period of 8 wk, for use as a feed ingredient in diets for the NGP boars. Colony forming units (cfu), pH, protein, energy, Ca and P were consistent across all 16 batches of yogurt. All of the 18 boars were fed a high-cholesterol diet for a period of 56 d at a rate of 2.268 kg/(hd.d) to furnish 6.661 g/(hd.d) of cholesterol. Nine of the boars then were fed 1.81 kg/(hd.d) of a second diet that was supplemented with .454 kg/(hd.d) of AY. The other nine boars were fed the original diet. Cholesterol intake was the same for the two dietary treatments. Blood samples were collected weekly from the brachial-jugular region and the sera were analyzed for lipids. Acidophilus yogurt reduced serum cholesterol (P less than .01) and low density lipoproteins (P less than .08), but it had no effect on serum triglycerides (P greater than .23) or on high density lipoproteins (P greater than .11). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There have, however, been few investigations of either the pharmacokinetics or the clinical investigations of either the pharmacokinetics or the clinical response to antidepressants in such patients. We report on the pharmacokinetics of nortriptyline at steady state in a group of 22 patients, average age 84, living within an institutional setting. Comparison of our findings with those previously reported for younger and healthier subjects suggests that there are no clinically significant group differences in nortriptyline kinetics. Plasma levels of nortriptyline and those of both the trans- and cishydroxylated metabolites are linear with daily dose. Mean (and SD) for the parameter (plasma level/dose) was 1.21 (0.63) ng/ml/mg/day for the parent compound, 1.41 (0.86) for the trans metabolite, and 0.30 (0.16) for the cis metabolite. There was no significant correlation across individuals between the accumulation of the parent compound and the metabolites. Based upon these data, the average dose of nortriptyline required to achieve a plasma level of 100 ng/ml is 80 mg/day. Dose requirements, however, vary between individuals by a factor of 20. Plasma levels measured 24 hours after a 25-mg test dose of nortriptyline can allow early identification of slow metabolizers. Twenty-four-hour plasma levels (mean 8.8 ng/ml, SD 3.2) were significantly correlated with steady state levels at 25 mg/day (r = 0.71), steady state levels at 50 mg/day (r = 0.73), and each individual's average (plasma level/dose) (r = 0.57). \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Drug-exposed worms were found to have intrinsic values of 5HT which were similar or slightly less than controls. Uptake measurements were made on single and on paired worms recovered from mesenteric, portal, or hepatic sites and incubated in 75% horse serum or in Fischer's medium. All groups of treated worms were found to take up, on average, similar or lower amounts of 5HT compared to controls. These findings are in contrast to a recent report of very considerable increases in content or in 5HT acquisition in vitro by hycanthone-exposed parasites. This communication suggests that the mode of action of hycanthone cannot be explained as being due to increased 5HT uptake. Morphological changes in hycanthone-treated worms include loss of body weight and size, loss of hemoglobin pigment from the gut, deterioration of the tegument, and derangement of the vitellaria. The loss of gut contents occurs early after exposure to hycanthone and may indicate that interference with gut physiology and the nutritional state of the worms is one consequence of the drug, although the mechanism of these changes has not yet been elucidated. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Each strain of N. gonorrhoeae has multiple (10-11) genes encoding for Opas. Identifiable elements in opa genes include the coding repeat within the signal sequence, conserve 5' and 3' regions, and hypervariable regions (HV1 and HV2) located within the structural gene. N. gonorrhoeae strains appear to have many biological properties in common that are either HV-region-mediated or associated with the presence of specific HV regions, suggesting that HV regions could be found in many clinical isolates. Oligonucleotides from three source strains representing three conserved regions of opa, 12 HV1 regions, and 14 HV2 regions were used by dot blot analysis to probe 120 clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae. The probe for the coding repeat hybridized to all 120 strains, the 3' conserved-region probe reacted with 98% of the strains, and the 5' conserved-region probe with 90% of the strains. Nine HV1 probes hybridized to 3.3-39.2% of the strains, and 13 of the HV2 probes hybridized to 1.7-25% of the isolates. Analysis of the number of probes that hybridized to each of the isolates showed that 19% did not hybridize with any of the HV1 probes and 25% did not hybridize with any of the HV2 probes. Approximately three-quarters of the isolates hybridized with one, two or three of the HV1 probes or one, two or three of the HV2 probes; 89% of the isolates hybridized to least one HV1 or one HV2 probe. The data indicate that some genes encoding HV regions of N. gonorrhoeae Opa proteins are widely distributed in nature. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Glomeruli and cortical tubules were prepared by a combination of sieving and density-gradient centrifugation. Under basal conditions, the contents of cAMP and cGMP in glomeruli were significantly higher than in tubules and unfractionated renal cortical tissue.Histamine caused a striking increase in cAMP in glomeruli (+Delta% 675+/-87) and, to a lesser degree, increased cAMP in tubules (+Delta% 103+/-25) or in tissue slices. This stimulation was dose-dependent in the range of 1 muM-1 mM histamine. Metiamide (an H(2)-antagonist), but not pyrilamine (an H(1)-antagonist) blocked the effect of histamine on cAMP, which indicates that histamine causes its effect via interaction with H(2) receptors. Histamine caused less extensive increases in cGMP in both glomeruli and tubules. Carbamylcholine caused a marked increase in cGMP in glomeruli (+Delta 295+/-7) and a much lower increase in tubules (+Delta% 70+/-20); these effects were blocked by atropine. Parathyroid hormone (1 mug/ml) increased cAMP and, to a much lesser degree, also cGMP in glomeruli. In tubules, parathyroid hormone caused much more extensive increases in cAMP than in glomeruli; no changes, or rather a small decline in cGMP, was observed. Angiotensin-II (2 muM) markedly lowered cAMP in glomeruli (-Delta% -45+/-8) and in tubules (-Delta% 33+/-7) but had no effect on cGMP. Bradykinin (20 muM) did not consistently influence either cAMP or cGMP in glomeruli or tubules. Present results demonstrate that cAMP and cGMP metabolism in glomeruli are controlled independently by humoral agents known to alter glomerular functions in vivo. Our findings are consistent with the view that histamine and cholinergic agents generated and (or) released locally in glomeruli or in their vicinity may play important roles as mediators of immunopathological injury of glomeruli, and that these effects are mediated by cAMP and (or) cGMP through interaction with H(2) receptors and muscarinic receptors. Likewise, our results suggest that the effects of angiotensin-II and parathyroid hormone on glomerular dynamics may be mediated by cyclic nucleotides.Thus, we surmise that extrarenal as well as intrarenal humoral agents may play an important role in the pathology and physiology of glomeruli through mediation of either cAMP, cGMP, or both. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Attributes such as regenerative plasticity, high fecundity, cultural adaptability, range of ploidy, economics of culture and maintenance of specific populations, and versatility make plant genetic systems prime candidates with which to monitor the environment for mutagens. A specific locus (equivalent to a classical Mendelian gene) controls the development of a phenotypic characteristic. It can also mutate to a new allelic form with a consequentially altered phenotypic characteristic and can be separated by crossing over from adjacent loci that govern other specific phenotypic characteristics. Since various plant species have numerous specific loci, one has a rich array of potential systems from which to select. Specific locus systems in higher plants could be used to assess the mutagenicity of single chemical compounds or combinations of chemical compounds. Depending on the circumstances, seeds and/or seedlings could be used; plants could be grown in situ in either containers or plots to assess the immediate environment for one or more mutagens over an extended period. Since plants are eucaryotes, data from such experiments could serve as one more source of information along with that obtained from a battery of other tests used in the tier system. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Isolated rat ventricles were perfused via the coronary arteries with 32Pi after which membrane vesicles partially enriched in sarcolemma were isolated from individual hearts. Alterations in the sarcolemmal slow inward Ca2+ current were assessed in the 32P-perfused hearts using a contractile slow response model. In this model, Na+ channels were first inactivated by partial depolarization of the hearts in 25 mM K+ after which alterations in Ca2+ channel activity produced by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists could be assessed as restoration of contractions. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine + propranolol) of the perfused hearts resulted in increased 32P incorporation into a 15-kDa sarcolemmal protein. This protein co-migrated with the 15-kDa sarcolemmal protein phosphorylated in hearts exposed to beta-adrenergic stimulation produced by isoproterenol. beta-Adrenergic stimulation, but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation, also resulted in phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein, phospholamban. Phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein in perfused hearts in response to either alpha- or beta-adrenergic stimulation was associated with restoration of contractions, indicative of increases in the slow inward Ca2+ current. Increases in 32P incorporation into the 15-kDa protein preceded restoration of contractions by phenylephrine. Nifedipine abolished the contractile responses to alpha-adrenergic stimulation while having no effect on increases in 15-kDa protein phosphorylation. The effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation occurred in the absence of increases in cAMP levels. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein may be involved in increases in the slow inward current produced by stimulation of either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Concentrations of puromycin greater than 10(-5) M inhibited mitosis, cytokinesis of fertilized eggs and leucine incorporation. In approximately 50% of the zygotes treated with puromycin (10(-5) M or greater) the female pronucleus remained at its site of formation, the cortex, and did not migrate centrad. In these instances the male pronucleus moved from its site of development to the female pronucleus. Concentrations of actinomycin D greater than 10(-7) M also inhibited mitosis and cytokinesis of fertilized eggs. Breakdown of the nuclear envelopes and association of the paternally- and maternally-derived chromatin did not occur in either puromycin- or actinomycin D-treated embryos. Actinomycin D at all of the concentrations employed (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) had little effect upon the structure of nucleolus-like bodies within male and female pronuclei. Male and female pronuclei of puromycin (10(-4) M) and actinomycin D (10(-5) M) treated zygotes, incubated with tritiated thymidine and prepared for scintillation counting and autoradiography, synthesized DNA at a reduced level when compared to control specimens. Although \"side effects\" of puromycin and actinomycin D treatment are not excluded, these results suggest that nascent proteins may be required for events of fertilization. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase was identified as the major specific binding protein for the Ins(1,4,5)P3 analogue glycolaldehyde (2)-1-phospho-D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate which can form covalent bonds with protein amino groups by reduction of the Schiff's base intermediate with [3H]NaCNBH3. This analogue, Ins(1,4,5) P3, and the inositol polyphosphates inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate were nearly equipotent in selectively releasing membrane bound aldolase with a K0.5 of about 3 microM. The rank order of the K0.5 values was identical to the KI values for inhibition of aldolase. Aldolase was also released by its substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced aldolase release did not disrupt the triad junction; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a known junctional constituent, was displaced only at much higher Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 was as effective as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in releasing aldolase from myofibrils. A finite number of binding sites for aldolase exist on triads (Bmax = 43-47 pmol of tetrameric aldolase exist on triads (Bmax = 43-47 pmol of tetrameric aldolase/mg of triad protein, KD = 23 nM). The junctional foot protein was implicated as an aldolase binding site by affinity chromatography with the junctional foot protein immobilized on Sepharose 4B.

Two groups of rats were formed on the basis of their circling response to a first injection of SKF 38393: clear contralateral circling (SKF-positive) and no (or ipsiversive) circling (SKF-negative). A few days later, these rats were tested once for bromocriptine-induced circling. A repeated treatment of 8 injections of SKF 38393 over 4 days was started the next day. The animals were tested again for bromocriptine-induced circling at the end of the repeated treatment with the D-1 agonist. A third group of rats received only the 2 test injections of bromocriptine and a fourth group included intact control animals. During the repeated treatment, the D-1 agonist induced an increase of the circling response up to the fourth injection and a decrease thereafter in the SKF-positive group. This was followed by a pronounced increase of circling in response to the second injection of bromocriptine. This increased sensitivity appears to be due to the chronic treatment with SKF 38393 since animals that did not respond initially to the D-1 agonist (SKF-negative group) and those that received only 2 injections of bromocriptine showed no increase of their circling response. The treatments did not increase the affinity of [3H]spiperone binding for the striatal D-2 dopamine receptor.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Neurons in both compartments exhibit profound functional differences: blob cells have color selective, unoriented receptive fields, whereas interblob cells are usually not color selective and have oriented receptive fields. Neuroanatomical tracing studies have shown that blob and interblob cells receive different inputs and participate in different projections. It is not known, however, whether this compartmental organization is also reflected in the dendritic morphology of individual cells. We therefore combined intracellular staining with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry to study the relationship between cell morphology and blob pattern in layers 2 and 3 of macaque striate cortex. Single cells were injected with the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow in lightly fixed tangential sections. Adjacent sections were reacted for cytochrome oxidase to reveal the blobs. The spatial relationship between stained cells and the pattern of the blobs were subsequently determined by aligning the sections by using radially running blood vessels as landmarks. Our results show that pyramidal cells located in blob and interblob regions do not differ in their soma size, spine density, and basal dendritic field structure. This indicates that the characteristic functional properties of the neurons in both compartments do not depend on the morphology of their dendritic trees. Since the elongation of the dendritic fields of blob and interblob cells was also found to be similar, we conclude that cortical orientation selectivity is not generated through elongated dendritic fields. We found several cells with dendrites freely crossing the borders between blob and interblob regions. These cells might correspond to cells with \"mixed\" receptive field properties, e.g., color selective oriented cells, which in physiological studies were found at the transition from blob to interblob regions. However, there were also a number of cells that respected the borders. A quantitative analysis of the dendritic fields revealed that 67% of the cells located close to the borders have a tendency to confine their dendrites to only one compartment. Thus the pattern of basal dendrites of these cells might be shaped by the parcellation of the striate cortex in blob and interblob regions. These dendritic field asymmetries may help to maintain the segregation at the single cell level into different processing channels in monkey striate cortex. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In parallel, the synthesis of the related proteins was monitored by immunohistochemistry. The cells metabolically active for type I and type III collagen expression were identified by hybridization using [32P]-labeled cDNA clones coding for human alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III), respectively. Type II collagen and core protein mRNAs were detected by hybridization with specific [32P]-labeled oligonucleotide probes. In the femoral heads of one 22-week old fetus and of one newborn, our in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chondrocytes located immediately subjacent to the perichondrium produced collagen types I, II, III as well as aggrecan; whereas only type II collagen and aggrecan gene expression was detected deeper in the cartilage covered by the perichondrium. This observation supports the hypothesis that the inner cell layers of perichondrium are chondrogenic, with a transient state where cells express all the markers studied here. At the articular surface different patterns of expression were observed at the two developmental stages. After 22 weeks of fetal development only collagen types I and III were expressed by the surface zone cells while in the newborn cartilage, these cells expressed all the molecules studied (collagen types I, II, III and cartilage proteoglycan). At both ages the underlying cartilage cells expressed only the cartilage-specific molecules (type II collagen and aggrecan). Thus a progressive transformation of cartilaginous matrix occurs with time from the deep cartilage up to the surface by addition of new components, i.e. aggrecan and type II collagen. These results supplemented by an immunofluorescence analysis on 20-, 26- and 38-week old fetal femoral heads suggest that expression of collagen and aggrecan in the cartilage covered by the perichondrium and in the cartilage at the articular surface are subject to different regulatory mechanisms during development. Furthermore, the appearance of hybridizable core protein and type II collagen mRNAs at the articular surface, closely followed by the appearance of the proteins for which they code, indicates that core protein and type II collagen expression is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level in this region. Finally, the similar topography observed for the expression of these two proteins suggests that the genes for these two major constituents of cartilage matrix are coordinately regulated during growth of articular cartilage. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Relatively stable baseline secretion levels of GH and PRL were followed by an abrupt and marked discharge of the hormones after TRH infusion in all of the experiments. The pattern of GH response was essentially the same as that of PRL. Moreover, a dose-response relationship was obtained between the TRH concentrations infused and the magnitude of GH and PRL responses. The infusion of CB154, on the other hand, inhibited both GH and PRL secretion in three experiments performed on different adenoma tissues. This effect of CB154 was prompt and lasted for a long period even after the infusion was discontinued. When TRH was perfused concomitantly with CB154, the stimulatory effect of TRH on GH release was maintained, while TRH-induced PRL secretion was completely blocked. The results suggest that both TRH and CB154 possess a direct action on pituitary adenoma cells of acromegaly and that aberrant GH responses to TRH and dopaminergic agonists in acromegalic patients may be explained by the altered cellular membrane receptors of the adenoma of these subjects. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Determinations can be completed in one day with as little as 5 ml of venous blood. Activities are proportional to the length of the incubation and the amount of tissue protein added, show appropriate dependence on added cofactors, are stable for up to 2 days at -20 degrees C, and do not appear to be affected by diet. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex appears to be fully activated (dephosphorylated) in these preparations. Activities were comparable in platelet-enriched fractions from 25 normal subjects and 25 patients with a variety of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. Mean values (+/- S.E.M.) for these 50 individuals were 169+/-9 pmol/min per mg protein for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and 535+/-27 pmol/min per mg protein for the ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. These values are comparable to those found in cultured skin fibroblast with similar techniques. Deficient pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (19+/-6 and 11+/-4 pmol/min per mg protein) was demonstrated in platelet-enriched preparations from two brothers whose fibroblasts had previously been shown to be deficient in pyruvate dehydrogenase and who responed to a ketogenic diet. Experimental detail critical to obtaining reproducible results with these methods are stressed (notably the crucial importance of maintaining the purity of the radioactive substrates).

Thresholds were determined at 13 locations in the central visual field up to 25 degrees. Refractive defocus was induced by blurring with glasses of +1, +2, +3, +6 and +9 diopters spherical. Three diffusers were used as artificial media opacities, causing a mean reduction of visual acuity to 0.46, 0.08, and 0.02. Blurring of the retinal image by a small defocus or by slight artificial media opacities causes a measurable reduction of light-difference sensitivity. Mean sensitivity (MS) and defocus are related logarithmically (log(MS)/defocus, r = -0.9297; P < 0.0001). The correlation between MS and the luminance factor l15, characterizing the artificial media opacities, is linear (MS/l15, r = -0.9736; P < 0.0001). Flicker fusion frequency resists retinal image degradation much better. Mean flicker frequency (MF) and defocus are related logarithmically (log(MF)/defocus, r = -0.4960; P < 0.0001). The correlation between mean flicker frequency (MF) and the luminance factor l15 is nonlinear (MF/[l15]2, r = 0.8693; P < 0.0001).

Exxon has developed a new method of refining these materials, a severe hydrotreatment process that is optimized for PAH removal. The specific objectives of the current study were to assess PAH reduction and then to evaluate directly the dermal carcinogenic potential of the materials that spanned the range of products produced by this method. The test samples included unrefined light and heavy vacuum distillates from a naphthenic crude oil, as well as the corresponding severely hydrotreated products. Two sets of samples were prepared to assess the effects of various operating parameters in the reactor. Additionally, positive (benzo[a]pyrene), negative (white mineral oil) and vehicle (toluene) control groups were included to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the bioassay. Each sample was applied in twice-weekly aliquots to the backs of 40 male C3H mice. In the analytical studies, significant reductions in the levels of several specific PAH were demonstrated. In the dermal carcinogenesis studies, the unrefined oils and the positive control induced tumors and also significantly reduced survival. None of the mice treated with severely hydrotreated oils or with the negative or vehicle controls developed skin tumors, and survival of these mice was not significantly different from the control. Thus, the data demonstrated that this new, severe hydrotreatment process was an effective means of converting carcinogenic feedstocks to non-carcinogenic products. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We observed similar characteristics for translocation of Mac-1 and neutrophil formyl peptide receptors (FPR) and hypothesize that the readily accessible pools of both Mac-1 and FPR are colocalized within this specific granule subset. Plasma membrane levels of both FPR (assessed with 3H-FMLP) and Mac-1 (assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-Mo-1-labeled cells) were markedly downregulated in cells prepared at low temperature from blood cooled to 4 degrees C immediately after removal from the circulation. Levels of both FPR and Mac-1 remained low on cells held at 4 degrees C. Upon warming, spontaneous upregulation of Mac-1 and FPR occurred with similar kinetics and temperature dependency. Translocation of both Mac-1 and FPR was markedly potentiated by exposure of cells to either fluoride ion (which has been shown by others to specifically elicit exocytosis of gelatinase-rich and vitamin B-12 binding protein-poor granules) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine that markedly potentiates the neutrophils' host defense capabilities. Levels of both FPR and Mac-1 on F-- or GM-CSF-treated neutrophils exceeded those present on cells incubated at 37 degrees C for extended time intervals, indicating that stimulated translocation may involve mobilization of an additional granule subset. Scatchard analysis showed that only low-affinity FPR were translocated during spontaneous and stimulus-dependent upregulation. To directly compare FPR levels on the surface of cells displaying varying levels of Mac-1 within a single cell suspension, cells were labeled with FITC-Mo-1 and sorted into subpopulations based on fluorescence intensity. After sorting, the individual populations were held at 4 degrees C to prevent further spontaneous upregulation, concentrated by centrifugation, and assayed for FPR levels. Under a variety of conditions, FPR levels correlated with Mac-1 (CD11b) expression on cell populations selected on the basis of CD11b fluorescence intensity. Analysis of subcellular fractions obtained from disrupted neutrophils before and after upregulation provided additional support for the hypothesis that Mac-1 and FPR are colocalized within a readily accessible subset of neutrophil granules.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The rhombencephalic nucleus of the lateral line lobe (nLLL) is the target nucleus of knollenorgan afferents. Cells in the nLLL receive a few medium size to large endings with round synaptic vesicles (classified as spoon; large club; small club-, and rodlet-shaped endings) with which they form nexus (gap junction) and asymmetrical chemical synapses associated with the round synaptic vesicles. In addition these endings emit thin collaterals which terminate as small boutons on nLLL neurons; these boutons also have round vesicles and make mixed (electrotonic and chemical) synapses. In addition, cells in the nLLL receive synaptic input from numerous small boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles and making symmetric synapses. We have not found any interneurons within nLLL. Our ultrastructural analysis suggests that boutons synapsing on nLLL neurons belong to only two afferent fiber systems and that the wiring diagram of nLLL is extremely simple. We have studied the immunolocalization in nLLL of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme essential for the synthesis of GABA that is also a useful marker for this widely distributed inhibitory neurotransmitter. GAD immunoreactivity was confined to the small boutons with pleomorphic vesicles. GAD was also found in a nucleus projecting to the nLLL, here named the sublemniscal nucleus (SL), which probably conveys corollary discharge signals to the nLLL. This GABAergic projection may be responsible for the potent inhibition associated with the electric organ discharge command that has been described in these cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(1970) Science 168, 255-257) have sufficiently low cation permeability to allow the examination  of the side-specific interactions of ligands with the asymmetric sodium pump complex. In accordance with the known properties of the pump in intact cells the following results were observed: (a) ATP-dependent sodium influx and (b) maximal (sodium, potassium)-ATPase with K+ present inside the vesicles with  larger than or equal to 20 micronM ATP. With much lower [ATP], K+ inhibited sodium-activated ATPase. K+ was inhibitory at either surface. Inhibition was different on the two sides since cytoplasmic (extravesicular) Na+ counteracted inhibition by cytoplasmic (extravesicular) K+ but not inhibition by K+ at the plasma or external membrane surface, i.e. intravesicular K+. A decrease in the steady state level of the phosphenzyme intermediate of sodium-activated ATPase was caused also by K+ at either surface. The effect of cytoplasmic K+ is compatible with its competitive inhibition of activation of phosphorylation of the enzyme by cytoplasmic Na+. At 37 degrees, the inhibitory effect of external K+ is due to interaction with the phosphoenzyme to form a stable complex of K+ with the dephosphenzyme resulting in a decreased overall reaction rate but increased turnover of the phosphoenzyme (E-P + K leads to EK + Pi). At 0 degree, external K+ inhibits by interacting with the unphosphorylated enzyme to form an occluded enzyme-K complex. This results in a decreased overall rate but relatively small change in apparent turnover of the phosphoenzyme. At 0 degree, but not at 37 degrees, external Na+ counteracted the inhibitory effects of external K+. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Found at autopsy in approximately 4 per cent of patients dying of malignant disease, they are clinically latent in most instances. Thus in a total series of 295 malignant tumours of the kidney, only 8 were metastases. The primary tumour is most often a bronchial carcinoma, this being confirmed in our series (5 cases). This is followed, in order of decreasing frequency, the breast, stomach, pancreas and stomach. Two of the 8 cases were rarities: a renal metastasis from a meningoblastoma and a metastasis from one tumour to another, a carcinoma of the ovary metastasising to a hypernephroma. The pathogenesis of these secondary tumours leads to the consideration of 2 modes of spread: haematogenous and lymphatic. They present no special clinical features. Intravenous pyelogram reveals the appearances of a malignant tumour mass. Angiography is more informative, the results reflecting the histological nature of the primary tumour. The latter being most frequently a carcinoma, the arteriographic image is one of hypovascularisation, thus differing from a hypernephroma with its rich vascularisation and resembling an infiltrating pelvi-calyceal carcinoma. Histopathological examination is not always conclusive itself. Nephrectomy is effectively only justified if the primary tumour has been or can be successfully treated in the absence of other metastases. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The major assumption of the model is that the only interaction between ions in a multiply-occupied channel is electrostatic. The electrostatic calculations indicate in a multiply-occupied channel is electrostatic. The electrostatic calculations indicate that there will be potential wells at each end of the channel and, at high concentrations, that both wells can be occupied. The kinetics are based on two reaction steps: movement of the ion from the bulk solution to the well and movement between the two wells. The kinetics for this reaction rate approach are identical to those based on the Nernst-Planck equation in the limit where the movement between the two wells is rate limiting. The experimental results for sodium and potassium are consistent with a maximum of two ions per channel. To explain the thallium results it is necessary to allow three ions per channel. It is shown that this case is compatible with the electrostatic calculations if the presence of an anion is included. The theoretical kinetics are in reasonable quantitative agreement with the following experimental measurements: single channel conductance of sodium, potassium, and thallium; bi-ionic potential and permeability ratio between sodium-potassium and potassium-thallium; the limiting conductance of potassium and thallium at high applied voltages; current-voltage curves for sodium and potassium at low (but not high) concentrations; and the inhibition of sodium conductance by thallium. The results suggest that the potential well is located close to the channel mouth and that the conductance is partially limited by the rate going from the bulk solution to the well. For thallium, this entrance rate is probably diffusion limited. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Male broiler chicks, 100 per trial, were raised as one group to 29 days for Trial 1 and 36 days for Trial 2. The birds were moved to environmental chambers and 50 per trial were acclimated by being subjected to 3 consecutive days of 24 C, 35 C, 24 C cyclic temperature. After acclimation, the birds were exposed to a linear change in temperature from 24 to 41 C over 3 h with a constant 10 C dewpoint, starting at 0800 h on Day 34 for Trial 1 and on Day 41 for Trial 2. The feeding schedule for the day of the heat exposure was as follows. For the feed group, feed was removed from the birds at 0400 h and placed back at 0700 h. For the no feed group, feed was removed at 0700 h. At 0800 h, feed was removed from all birds but water was accessible throughout the heat exposure. Acclimated and unacclimated birds given access to feed for 1 h before a heat exposure consumed 60 and 50 mL of water per broiler, respectively, during the heat exposure. However, for broilers not receiving feed, the water consumption was 58 and 30 mL per broiler, respectively. Acclimated and unacclimated broilers given access to feed had similar body temperatures, but the acclimated broilers not receiving feed had a significantly lower ending rectal temperature than the unacclimated group. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A retrospective study of 38 patients with prostatic or other pelvic tumors treated with radiation showed that 31.6% had a normal prostatic zonal pattern (peripheral zone hyperintense to central gland) on T2-weighted images, and 7.9% showed reversal of the zonal pattern; among the rest, the entire gland was diffusely isointense to fat in 42.1%, hypointense to fat in 10.5%, and hyperintense to fat in 7.9%. Sixty-three percent of the SV had a normal appearance, 21% had fewer tubules but normal signal intensity (SI), 8% had diffuse loss of SI (hypointense to fat), and 8% were hypointense to muscle. Quantitative measurements of SI of the prostate and SV demonstrated a statistically significant lower mean value for the irradiated patients relative to 10 control patients. A decrease in the size of both the prostate and SV was observed in 33% of patients with baseline studies. Use of additional treatment modalities in patients with prostatic carcinoma appeared to correlate with increased likelihood of developing abnormal changes. The authors conclude that in the irradiated patient, the prostate and SV can develop several patterns of SI abnormalities; in particular, diffuse low SI in the prostate and SV should establish radiation fibrosis as an important differential diagnosis to consider. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

LA-N-2 cells were labeled with [14C-methyl]choline for 24 hr, harvested, and incubated in Hepes/BSA/saline buffer for varying periods of time. The radioactive compound present in the cytosol and released into Hepes/BSA/saline buffer medium in the presence or absence of TPA was phosphorylcholine. There was a gradual increase in the appearance of radioactivity in the medium and this corresponded to a gradual decline in the radioactivity present in the cytosolic compartment with a statistically significant P value of less than .005. Identical results were obtained with prelabeled cells subsequently incubated with TPA. There was no significant change in the amount of radioactivity associated with lipid suggesting that the phosphorylcholine may be released directly from the cytosolic compartment into the medium rather than originating through a phospholipase-C catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. This possibility received support from experiments in which cells were electropermeabilized in the presence of radioactive phosphorylcholine. It was found that the introduced [14C]phosphorylcholine was released intact into the incubation medium from the cytosolic compartment. The incorporation of [14C]choline, [14C]ethanolamine, and [14C]serine by LA-N-2 cells into their corresponding phospholipids was investigated in the presence or absence of TPA. The presence of TPA increased the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the phospholipids with a corresponding decrease in the amount of radioactivity in the cytosolic compartment compared to control cultures. There were no detectable differences between TPA exposed and control cells in the distribution of radioactivity in free choline, phosphorylcholine, or CDP-choline of [14C] choline labeled cells. This indicates that the increased lipid labeling was not accompanied by enhanced labeling of the intermediates of the de novo pathway. This effect of TPA in altering the distribution of labeling of the cytosolic and lipid components was not demonstrable with cells grown in the presence of 10(-5) M retinoic acid. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Adult male ICR strain mice weighing about 40 g were used. The mice were divided into 2 groups: the Cs group (Cs 50 mg/kg/day was orally given for 14 consecutive days) and the control group (olive oil for 14 days). Urine was stored for 24 hours on the day 0, 7 and 14 and urine volume and concentrations of urinary creatinine (u-Cr) and urinary potassium (u-K) were measured in each group. All the mice were sacrificed and examined on the 15th day. Concentrations of serum creatinine (s-Cr), serum potassium (s-K), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (Ald) were noted in each group. The kidneys were also examined histologically with light and electron microscopes. The Cs group showed significant increases of s-K, PRA and Ald and a significant decrease of creatinine clearance compared with the control group. Histologically, the Cs group demonstrated focal vacuolar changes in the proximal tubular cells and an increase in the number of granules in the JG cells. Each granule of the Cs group was larger than that of the control group. Cs certainly stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and causes consequently a secondary aldosteronism. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Direct purification of the recombinant aldose reductase by affinity column chromatography using Matrex gel orange A yielded a single 36 kDa band, similar in size to the purified human muscle aldose reductase, on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel after silver staining. The isoelectric point of the recombinant enzyme was 5.85 which is identical to the human muscle aldose reductase. Following the treatment with an acylamino-acid releasing enzyme, the blocked NH2-terminal amino acid was identified to be acetylalanine. The successive NH2-terminal sequence and that of the COOH-terminal peptide concurred with the expected translated sequence. Kinetic analyses of the recombinant enzyme activity for various substrates and the cofactor, NADPH, demonstrated a good agreement with the previously reported kinetic data on the purified human aldose reductase. A high concentration of (NH4)2SO4 elicited a significant increase in both Km and Kcat for DL-glyceraldehyde as well as D-glucose. Although IC50 values for most of the aldose reductase inhibitors with recombinant enzyme were found to fall within the comparable range of those obtained with nonhuman mammalian enzymes, the IC50 value for epalrestat was more than 10-fold higher in the recombinant enzyme. These results indicate that the recombinant human aldose reductase expressed in the baculovirus system possesses structurally and enzymatically similar properties as those reported for the native human enzyme and should serve as a superior enzyme preparation to nonhuman mammalian enzymes for the screening of the efficacy and potency of newly developed aldose reductase inhibitors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In one flock even after two treatments 66.7% were still infected; therefore, suspect methods of treatment have to be avoided and a constant change of anthelmintics is absolutely essential.

Theoretically, the temperature dependence of the critical DNA repair process(es) should be 1) either independent of or identical to the temperature dependence of cell killing if the first two hypotheses are correct, and 2) different if the third hypothesis is correct. To test this, exponentially growing rat 9L brain tumor cells were left at 37 degrees C or equilibrated for 3-14 h at 20 degrees C before irradiation. Cells were irradiated and allowed to repair at either 20 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Alternatively, the cells were irradiated at one of these temperatures and immediately shifted to the other temperature for repair. DNA damage was assessed by the alkaline elution technique; cell kill was assessed by a clonogenic assay. 9L cells maintained at 20 degrees C or 37 degrees C sustained the same amount of DNA damage as measured by alkaline elution. DNA repair instantaneously assumed the rate characteristic of the postirradiation temperature. For 9L cells equilibrated, irradiated, and repaired at 20 degrees C, the half-time of the fast phase of the DNA repair decreased by a factor of approximately 2 and the half-time of the slow phase decreased by a factor of approximately 5 over that measured in cells incubated, irradiated and repaired at 37 degrees C. Although the rate of DNA repair decreased substantially at 20 degrees C, the survival of 9L cells that were equilibrated and irradiated at 20 degrees C was greater (p less than 10(-4)) than those incubated and irradiated at 37 degrees C, when assayed by an immediate plating protocol. In addition, the survival of 9L cells equilibrated and irradiated at 20 degrees C and then shifted to 37 degrees C immediately after irradiation was greater (p less than 10(-2)) than that obtained with any other delayed plating protocol. Thus, the temperature dependence of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution was different from the temperature dependence of cell killing measured either by an immediate or delayed plating protocol. These data support the hypothesis that many irradiated 9L tumor cells die because of imbalances in sets of competing biochemical and/or metabolic processes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The sensitivity of stress-ECG is low, 201-thallium scintigraphy is more sensitive but has the disadvantages of radiation and costs. Improved echocardiographic resolution with better identification of endocardial border as well as digital imaging technique have increased the interest in stress echocardiography as a diagnostic tool in coronary artery disease since a decade ago the clinical usefulness of stress echocardiography has been demonstrated. For stress echocardiography a semisupine bicycle position for continuous recording of echocardiographic images from the apical position in the two-chamber- and RAO-view was developed. Echocardiographic images were digitized with a frame rate of 30/s and stored on optical discs with a storage capacity of 1 Gbyte. Rest and exercise images were analysed simultaneously for newly-occurring wall motion abnormalities or deterioration of already present hypokinesia or extension of existing wall motion abnormalities. Segmental wall motion was scored according to the scheme in Figure 2. In addition end-diastolic, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction were calculated. In a patient population of 150, 30 female and 120 male, age 56.6 +/- 8.3 years, we could confirm the results reported by other working groups and demonstrate a high sensitivity in the diagnosis of single vessel disease. Our technique with the patient cycling in semi-supine position allows continuous echocardiographic registration during exercise and offers adequate image quality. The mean workload at peak stress was 127 +/- 30 watts, the maximal heart rate 137 +/- 18 bpm. Digital cine-loop imaging allowed evaluation of the examinations in about 90% of the cases. The sensitivity in the whole study group was 87%, the specificity 80%. Under full antianginal medication, 43% of the patients developed angina pectoris during exercise and 58% had a positive stress-ECG. The sensitivity in single-vessel coronary artery disease was 93% for the left anterior descending, 80% for the left circumflex, and 83% for the right coronary artery. These results in single-vessel disease were superior compared to findings of other authors using different techniques of stress echocardiography. In addition to the qualitative analysis, quantitative measurement of end-systolic volume and ejection fraction seems to be important. We found a significantly more pronounced decrease of ejection fraction at peak exercise in patients with multivessel disease compared to those with single-vessel disease. In single-vessel disease ejection fraction was 61 +/- 12% at rest and 57 +/- 17% during exercise, this difference was not significant.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There was no decrease in corneal sensitivity noted in any patient. All families displayed evidence of an autosomal dominant hereditary pattern and progression of the dystrophy is slow and benign in character.  With the exception of one family with atopic disease, no systemic organic illness was noted by histroy in all of the families. Laboratory screening of 2 of the 5 families showed no abnormalities of any systemic metabolic disorders.

There are few if any circular fascicles in the part of the deep white zone that is in register with the ventral part of the gray.

The controversial initial stages of excitation-contraction coupling in platelets lead to the release of calcium from the dense tubular system, the morphological counterpart of the muscle sarcotubular closed vesicles. Calcium triggers the actin-myosin interaction and the developing force, possibly together with a local increase of the cation concentration, may cause the collapse of the microtubular ring and its reappearance in the forming long pseudopodia. Actin-myosin interaction is modulated by several factors among which tropomyosin-troponin, responsible for the calcium-sensitivity of contractile processes, and phosphorylation of one of the myosin light chains. Platelet actin is anchored to the membrane and its sliding towards the short myosin filaments may form the basis for platelet shape change. Platelet alpha-actinin and actin-binding protein are able to aggregate actin into an impressive gel. Therefore, the contractile proteins seem to have a double role in controlling the consistency of the cytoplasmic gel on the one hand, and the contractile manifestations related to motility on the other hand. One of the most important features of the 'contracted' platelet is the rigidity of the pseudopodia brought about by the 'gelification' of actin filaments and the presence of microtubules. A new model for clot contraction is proposed, based on the rigidity of the long spiky pseudopodia and on the motile properties of platelets. While migrating towards each other, the interlocking pseudopodia from different platelets adhere to the polymerizing fibrin, compressing the fibrin nets in their pathway. Since the anchoring of contractile fibers to membranes is crucial for the platelet contractile manifestations, the integrity of the membrane structure should be considered in the study of pathological aspects of platelet function. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

One activity removing dipeptides from the NH2-terminal end of Gly-Pro-pNA was specifically inhibited by di-isopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulphony fluoride (PMSF), and diprotin A, and thus was identified as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). A group of bestatin-sensitive N-exoaminopeptidase activities was also characterized when Ala-, Leu-, and Arg-pNA were used as chromogenic substrates. Using human monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 26 that recognized, respectively, an N-Ala-aminopeptidase and DPP IV, it was found that human dermal fibroblasts expressed the CD 13 and CD 26 antigen on their surface. In addition, both peptidases were specifically immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 26 from plasma membranes. Cell surface proteolytic activities were also investigated in human fibroblasts derived from dermatological and rheumatic diseases (i.e., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lichen planus). It was found that these fibroblasts also expressed both types of proteinases initially identified on normal skin fibroblasts and that the levels of Ala-aminopeptidase activities were similar in all cases. In contrast, the levels of Arg-, Leu-exoaminopeptidase, and DPP IV activities were significantly higher (up to 6.6-fold) in the three pathological fibroblast populations than in their normal counterparts. These proteolytic enzymes, therefore, can potentially serve as markers in dermatological diseases. Taken together, our results suggest that skin fibroblast-derived proteinases associated with both serine and N-aminopeptidase activities may play an important role by participating in the extracellular events associated with fibroblast behaviour. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although each of these patients was referred to the neurosurgical service for evaluation for an extracranial-intracranial microvascular bypass procedure, complete arteriographic evaluations of their cerebrovasculature suggested that alternative methods should be the treatment of choice. For each patient reported the ipsilateral external carotid artery was demonstrated by angiography to be an important source of collateral blood supply to the cerebral hemispheres or retinae distal to the occluded internal carotid arteries. Ten patients with no significant atherosclerotic narrowing or ulceration of the external carotid artery have remained free of symptoms of cerebral ischemia for 6 to 40 months. In twelve patients who developed delayed recurrent cerebral or retinal ischemia ipsilateral to their internal carotid artery occlusion, there were found obstructive and/or ulcerative plaques involving the common and/or external carotid arteries. Thromboendarterectomy in 11 of these patients gave complete relief of ischemic symptoms during the 4 to 36 months of postoperative follow up.

All female infertility factors had to be meticulously corrected for at least eight cycles for inclusion in the study, along with a minimum of 1 1/2 years\\' duration of infertility. Within 8 months, 29 of 50 couples (58%) with clomiphene therapy of the male achieved a pregnancy, but only 8 of 50 (16%) with ascorbic acid treatment of the male. There were no appreciable changes in sperm counts, motility, or morphology after either treatment, nor were there any significant differences in semen parameters in those conceiving versus those who did not. Further, improved fertility could not be accounted for by improvement in the hamster ova penetration test. Possibly, clomiphene improves some quality of the sperm that is defective but not measurable by standard androgenologic methods, or it improves some aspect of the seminal plasma. Perhaps, though, the results might be better explained on a psychogenic basis, i.e., clomiphene is a \"better\" placebo than ascorbic acid.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Antisera against both NPY and its C-terminal flanking peptide (C-PON) were used, demonstrating a general coexistence of both peptides, as described in other vertebrates. Most NPY-like immunoreactive (NPY-LI) cell bodies were observed in the telencephalon, specifically in various olfactory structures, all cortices, septum, basal ganglia (except for the globus pallidus), the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the amygdaloid complex, and the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure. NPY-LI cells were also seen in the preoptic and hypothalamic regions and the dorsal thalamus (mainly in the perirotundal belt), as well as in the mesencephalic tegmentum (in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, and the retrorubral area). NPY-LI fibers and terminals were widely distributed in the brain. All visual and auditory neuropiles were densely innervated. Specially dense plexuses were seen in the nucleus accumbens, the ventral pallidum, the suprachiasmatic and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus medialis thalami, the left habenula, and the central nucleus of the torus semicircularis. Our analysis shows that the distribution of NPY-like immunoreactivity in the forebrain of Gallotia largely resembles that of other vertebrates, whereas differences are mainly observed in the brainstem. The widespread distribution of NPY in the lizard brain suggests several modulatory functional roles, either in local-circuit systems of the forebrain, or in various limbic, neuroendocrine, and sensory pathways. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fertility (ewes lambing per ewe exposed), lambing rate (lambs born per ewe exposed) and litter size (lambs born per ewe lambing) were evaluated at lambing in the spring of each year. Embryonic survival was estimated as the number of lambs born per corpora lutea. Ovulation rates were 1.28, 1.73 and 1.46 for low, high and control lines, respectively. More (P less than .01) single ovulations occurred in low-line ewes than in the other two lines; high-line ewes had more (P less than .01) twin ovulations than did low- or control-line ewes. Fertility did not differ among lines. Selection line affected (P less than .01) lambing rate at first and all services. Control-line ewes had mean lambing rates at first and all services that were intermediate between those of the low and high lines, which were different from each other. Line x age of ewe interactions existed (P less than .01) for lambing rate at all services and litter size at first and all services. High-line ewes had lower lambing rates and litter sizes as 2-yr-olds than other lines, but their performance increased steadily to 6-yr-olds, whereas the low and control lines remained relatively constant. Embryo survival differed (P less than .10) between lines, being 74%, 63% and 67% for low, high and control lines, respectively.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Extrapolation of the submaximal cardiac frequency (FH) and oxygen intake (VO2) responses to an assumed FH amx of 175 in one-leg and 195 in two-leg work resulted in a systematic overestimation of VO2 max. This overestimation could be removed by applying the appropriate regression equations, but the overall accuracy of the extrapolation method was limited to +/- 15% in the case of the injured leg and +/- 8% for either the uninjured leg or both legs combined. Prediction of VO2 max from leg muscle (plus bone) volume gave the same order of accuracy. However, it was shown that the VO2 max of the injured leg could be predicted with an accuracy of +/- 5%, if the observed VO2 max data of the uninjured leg and two legs were combined and utilized in the following formula: VO2 max (injured leg) = (A X 2) - VO2 max (uninjured leg), where A is the mean one-leg VO2 max predicted from the two-leg VO2 max observed. It was concluded that wherever possible the one-leg and two-leg VO2 max of patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy should be measured directly. If the patient is unable to pedal the bicycle ergometer with his injured leg alone then the VO2 max of this limb may be predicted from leg volume measurements or from the observed uninjured and two-leg VO2 max with an accuracy of approximately 8%. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results were quantitatively explained by a two-step mechanism: a reversible dissociation of the actin-nucleotide complex followed by a fast irreversible inactivation of nucleotide-free G-actin. Under normal conditions (0.8 mM CaCl2, pH 8.2,21 degrees C), the rate-limiting step was the dissociation of the nucleotide-G-actin complex. The half-time of the dissociation of xiATP from G-actin was 290 s as compared to only 13 s for the following denaturation step of nucleotide-free actin. 1 mM EDTA highly accelerated the dissociation step and, regardless of its concentration, the complex dissociated quantitatively within 1 min. Addition of Ca2+ within 20 s after EDTA addition induced a re-association of xiATP with nucleotide-free but still native G-actin. This reversal was kinetically resolved by means of a multimixing stopped-flow apparatus. The association rate constant was 6 X 10(6) M-1s-1. From the association and dissociation rate constant, a value of 2.5 X (10(9) M-1 was calculated for the binding constant of xiATP to G-actin. The binding constant of ATP (1.4 X 10(10) M-1) was derived from the relative binding constant of xiATP and ATP as determined by fluorescence titration of xiATP-G-actin with ATP. These binding constants are 10(3)-10(4) times higher than values reported earlier on the basis of more indirect data. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Exp. 1: Marathon with 17 male sportsmen in 2 groups with different glucose supply. Exp. 2: 45-km crosscountry run with 41 males. Exp. 3: Three 20-km runs with 8 young females at intervals of 3 months. In the marathon, no significant changes of the Sm-C/IGF-I concentration were found between the start, half distance and final values. The exogenous glucose supply (continuous or discontinuous) had also no effect. The tendency of a slight decrease of the Sm-C/IGF-I concentration by 0.14 U/ml (p greater than 0.05) was observed between start and finish in the 45 km crosscountry run lasting one hour longer. In the three 20-km runs, reproducible, slightly increased levels were measured at the end, whereas a decrease to the initial value or even below was detected on the following day (p greater than 0.05). The insignificant alterations of the Sm-C/IGF-I concentration measured in the 3 variants of races show that neither the hormonal changes stimulating the Sm-C/IGF-I synthesis (e.g. increase of GH and prolactin) nor inhibiting factors (energy deficiency) clearly dominate during strenuous exercises. The binding of carrier protein prevents great variations of the Sm-C/IGF-I level even under the condition of 3- to 4-hour extreme endurance exercises. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To this end the DNA repair capacity was determined after gamma-irradiation with 3 groups of male white Sprague-Dawley rats aged 6, 18-20 and 32-34 months. The organs liver, kidney, heart and spleen were used for this investigation. The relative repair (RR) showed a discontinuous course both in the 4 organs, and in the 3 different age groups. We define \"relative repair\" as the relationship between the specific activity of DNA decomposition products and the specific activity of DNA in an irradiated test group, as compared with an unirradiated control group. In all age groups the course was similar in the liver and the spleen, especially in the young rats, as well as in the heart and the kidney. Age differences were seen to be significant in all 4 organs at particular intervals after the irradiation, which means that the maximum relative repair occurs at different times. The integration over the whole course of the investigation shows a distinct reduction in the relative repair with increasing age in all the investigated organs except the spleen, where we could not see a difference between the 2 older groups. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In both preparations the uptake of the two amines was selective at the concentration used (1 times 10- minus 7 M or lower). The KM values for the amines (NA: 2 times 10- minus 7 M in synaptosomes and 5 times 10- minus 7 M in slices; 5-HT: 8 times 10- minus 8 M in synaptosomes and 6 times 10- minus 7 M in slices) and the inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the antidepressant agents were lower in the synaptosome experiments than in the slices experiments. Moreover the order of the inhibitory activities differed between the two preparations. In the slices experiments the NA uptake was inhibited most markedly by desipramine followed by imipramine greater than chlorimipramine = nortriptyline greater than or equal to amitriptyline greater than or equal to chlordesipramine whereas in the synaptosome experiments the order was desipramine greater than nortriptyline greater than or equal to chlordesipramine greater than or equal to imipramine greater than amitriptyline greater than or equal to chlorimipramine. For the 5-HT uptake in slices the order of activity was: chlorimipramine greater than imipramine greater than or equal to amitriptyline greater than or equal to chlordesipramine = desipramine greater than or equal to nortriptyline whereas in the synaptosome preparations the order was: chlorimipramine greater than imipramine greater than or equal to amitriptyline greater than or equal to chlordesipramine greater than nortriptyline = desipramine.

In the mouse the pallid pigment mutant has abnormalities of the otoliths of the inner ear together with a bleeding abnormality caused by platelet storage pool deficiency (SPD). To determine if this association is common, two other mouse pigment mutants, muted and mocha, which are known to have inner ear abnormalities, were examined for hematologic abnormalities. Both mutants had prolonged bleeding times accompanied by abnormalities of dense granules as determined by whole mount electron microscopy of platelets and by labeling platelets with mepacrine. When mutant platelets were treated with collagen, there was minimal secretion of adenosine triphosphate and aggregation was reduced. Lysosomal enzyme secretion in response to thrombin treatment was partially reduced in muted platelets and markedly reduced in mocha platelets. Similar reductions in constitutive lysosomal enzyme secretion from kidney proximal tubule cells were noted in the two mutants. These studies show that several mutations that cause pigment dilution and platelet SPD are associated with abnormalities of the inner ear. Also, these mutants, like previously described mouse pigment mutants, are models for human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and provide additional examples of single genes that simultaneously affect melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the course of our investigation on the interaction of ovarian components with EGF, we observed that partially purified glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) isolated from mouse ovaries enhanced the angiogenic activity of EGF when applied simultaneously to the lateral wall of the sheath of musculus rectus abdominis. Mouse EGF from submandibular glands embedded in Elvax 40 implanting on the musculus rectus abdominis induced neovascularization in a dose-dependent manner. When 0.5 micrograms ovarian GAGs was embedded in the implant with a low amount of EGF that induced only slight neovascularization (0.5 or 1 microgram/implant), the angiogenic activity of the growth factor was markedly enhanced. The active GAG component was isolated by chromatography on Dowex 1-x2. The fraction eluted with 0.5 M NaCl possessed the greatest activity to potentiate the angiogenic activity of EGF. When the reaction mixture of GAGs and EGF was treated with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride, the angiogenic activity was identified with the supernatant. On the other hand, after incubating EGF with 0.5 M NaCl fraction, the angiogenic activity of EGF was identified with the precipitate (GAG fraction) of the cetylpyridinium chloride-treated reaction mixtures. These findings show that ovarian GAGs potentiate the angiogenic activity of EGF by interacting or complexing with EGF. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The treatment was designed to deliver a combined dose (external beam plus intracavitary) of 7000-8000 cGy to Point A and 5000-6500 cGy to the pelvic lymph nodes depending upon the stage of the disease. The maximum dose to the bladder and to the rectum were calculated from the orthogonal intracavitary placement films with contrast material in these organs. Thirty-three cases of cystitis and fifty-eight cases of proctitis were recorded. The mean bladder dose for the group of patients with cystitis was higher, 6661 +/- 1309 cGy, than that for the patients without cystitis, 6298 +/- 1305 cGy, p = .19. The risk of cystitis increased as a function of bladder dose ranging from 3% for patients receiving less than or equal to 5000 cGy to the bladder to 12% for patients receiving greater than or equal to 8001 cGy to the bladder. A similar correlation was also found for rectal dose and proctitis. The mean rectal dose for the group of patients with proctitis was higher, 6907 +/- 981 cGy, than that for the patients without proctitis, 6381 +/- 1290 cGy, p = .003. The risk of proctitis increased as a function of rectal dose ranging from 2% for patients receiving less than or equal to 5000 cGy to the rectum to 18% for patients receiving greater than or equal to 8001 cGy to the rectum. A study of the severity of the cystitis as a function of bladder dose revealed a relationship between bladder dose and the severity of the complication (Grade I cystitis = 6600 +/- 1318 cGy vs Grade III cystitis = 6856 +/- 853 cGy). A dose-response relationship was found between the rectal dose and the severity of the complication (Grade I proctitis = 6810 +/- 906 cGy vs Grade III proctitis = 6997 +/- 1137 cGy). This relationship was statistically significant, p = .003. While there was no difference in the frequency of cystitis as a function of dose to the whole pelvis, the risk of proctitis did increase with increasing doses of external beam to the whole pelvis. It ranged from 3% for patients who received 2000 cGy or less to the whole pelvis to 14% for patients who received greater than 4000 cGy to the whole pelvis, p = .02. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Binding of (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (Cyp) to sections of splenic vascular bundle equilibrated within 150 min and slowly dissociated after addition of (-)-propranolol. The process was saturable with a dissociation constant (KD) of 40.3 +/- 4.4 pM and Bmax of 18.9 +/- 1.7 fM (in 6 sections). Binding to sections was stereoselective, the (-)-isomer of propranolol being 90 times more effective than the (+)-isomer in competing for (-)-[125I]-Cyp binding. Delineation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes using the selective antagonists betaxolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2) indicated that the receptors present were almost exclusively of the beta 2-subtype. Autoradiographic studies under the conditions evaluated in the biochemical experiments showed that beta-adrenoceptors are unevenly distributed in the dog splenic vein, artery and associated nerve bundles. High concentrations of receptors are associated with the splenic nerves and lower but still significant concentrations in the vasculature. Higher resolution studies with nuclear emulsion coated coverslips revealed concentrations of beta-adrenoceptors over cells adjacent to the lumen in veins. In arteries most beta-adrenoceptors were found associated with the medial layer with fewer receptors towards the intima or adventitia. Serial sections of either artery or vein incubated with (-)-[125I]-Cyp in the presence of (-)-propranolol showed low levels of non-localized binding. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Glucose transport activity was assessed by measuring 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport. The concentration of erythrocyte type glucose transporter (GLUT-1) and muscle/fat type transporter (GLUT-4) was measured by immunoblotting. The amount of each transporter in intact cells was estimated by the amount of transporter and protein of each membrane fraction and by the recovery of marker enzymes. In cells from safflower-fed rats compared with those from carbohydrate-fed rats, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity per cell decreased to 51% after a 1-wk feeding, and cell size increase became larger with these effects and continued for at least 4 wk. At 1 wk of feeding, GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 per cell in plasma membrane from insulin-treated cells decreased to 62 and 35%, respectively, with concomitant transporter decreases in the low-density microsome fraction. In cells from high-fish oil-fed rats in which two-thirds of safflower oil was replaced by fish oil, when compared with those from safflower oil-fed rats, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity increased 1.7-fold after 1 wk of feeding with concomitant cellular GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 increases, but its effect declined thereafter.

In this model, noradrenaline and methoxamine, but not UK 14304 reduced the potassium evoked release of [3H]-acetylcholine. The inhibitory action of these drugs was antagonized by the alpha 1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Propranolol, idazoxan and sulpiride did not antagonize the inhibition by noradrenaline of the potassium-evoked release of [3H]-acetylcholine. Exposure to amphetamine, beta-phenylethylamine, m- or p-tyramine, increased in a concentration-dependent manner the spontaneous outflow of [3H]-noradrenaline from atrial slices. Yet, these concentrations of the indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines, tested in the presence of an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), failed to modify the potassium evoked release of [3H]-acetylcholine. Desipramine 3 mumol/l or cocaine 10 mumol/l did not affect the release of [3H]-acetylcholine evoked by potassium stimulation. Under similar experimental conditions, beta-phenylethylamine facilitated the spontaneous outflow of [3H]-noradrenaline, and inhibited the electrically-evoked release of [3H]-serotonin from the hippocampus by activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the release of acetylcholine from atrial cholinergic neurons can be modulated through inhibitory alpha 1-adrenoceptors, which are not activated when the release of noradrenaline is induced by indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines. In addition, amphetamine or structurally related amines do not activate directly recognition sites in the cholinergic postganglionic parasympathetic neuron to modify the release of [3H]-acetylcholine. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Thrombus formation was induced by a device consisting of a tubular segment coated with type I collagen, followed by two regions of expanded diameter exhibiting disturbed flow and stasis. The thrombogenic device was incorporated into femoral arteriovenous shunts under conditions of intermediate wall shear rate (100 s-1). Thrombus formation was measured by scintillation camera imaging of 111In-platelets and by counting of 125I-fibrinogen/fibrin. Thrombus that formed on the collagen substrate was rich in platelets, while thrombus formed in the disturbed flow regions was rich in fibrin and red cells. RGDV peptide was infused proximal to the thrombogenic device to maintain local plasma concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 microM. Infused RGDV decreased the accumulation of both platelets and fibrin on the collagen substrate in a dose-response manner. At the highest dose platelet and fibrin deposition after 40 min was reduced by greater than 80% (P less than 0.01). In the region of disturbed flow, RGDV (100 microM) reduced platelet deposition by 85% (P less than 0.01) but did not reduce the accumulation of fibrin (P less than 0.3). Similarly, the peptide inhibited the release of granular proteins from platelets associated with thrombus (platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin; P less than 0.01), but did not prevent the appearance of fibrinopeptide A in circulating blood (P greater than 0.1). No systemic alterations in blood pressure, bleeding time, or platelet aggregation ex vivo were produced by locally infused RGDV. The antithrombotic effects of RGDV peptide disappeared within 5 min after discontinuing the infusion. In control studies infused RGEV (Arg-Gly-Glu-Val, 100 microM) showed no antithrombotic activity. Thus, RGDV selectively blocks platelet-dependent thrombus formation in vivo. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Incontinence was related to the frequency of urinating in the daytime. All incontinent patients of the day hospital were referred to the urologist at the University Hospital. Only about one third of these patients participated in the cystometric and cystoscopic examinations. The main reasons for non-attendance were unwillingness of the patient, referral of the patient to another place of care and resistant urinary infection. Urinary retention and small bladder capacity were common findings by cystometry and cystoscopy. A surgical management was recommended to seven per cent and conservative management to 93% of the patients. The concordance rates between the classification of the incontinence by anamnestic questions and the classification made by the urologist were not very high: the overall percentage of agreement was 40%. It is concluded, that not all incontinent elderly patients should be sent for cystometric and cystoscopic examination. Residual urine should be measured, if urinary retention is thought to be associated with incontinence. Furthermore, the classification of incontinence cannot be made only by using anamnestic questions. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

More extensive genetic tests made subsequently (de Serres, 1989a) on the 832 X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations recovered in those experiments showed that unexpected high frequencies of reparable and irreparable ad-3 mutants are actually multiple-locus mutants that have additional, but separate, sites of recessive lethal (RLCL) damage in the immediately adjacent genetic regions (designated ad-3R + RLCL or ad-3IR + RLCL). The frequencies of these X-ray-induced multiple-locus mutants in the ad-3 region are orders of magnitude higher than expected on the basis of target theory (where the frequency of the double mutant is expected to be the product of the frequencies of each single mutant) and classical models of chromosome structure during interphase (de Serres, 1989a). In the present paper, a random sample of 832 X-ray-induced ad-3 mutants of genotype ad-3A or ad-3B that are irreparable have been subjected to more extensive genetic fine-structure analysis. These experiments were designed to determine the extent of the functional inactivation in individual mutants in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions in mutants classified as presumptive multilocus deletions or multiple-locus mutations. These experiments have shown that in Neurospora crassa most X-ray-induced irreparable mutants of genotype ad-3A or ad-3B map as a series of overlapping multilocus deletions.

However, the connections of DL/V4 have not been examined in terms of these subdivisions. To determine the cortical connections of the caudal subdivision of DL (DLC) in squirrel monkeys, injections of the neuroanatomical tracers wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, Diamidino Yellow, and Fluoro-Gold were made in cortex rostral to V II. To aid in delineating the borders of DLC, cortex was also evaluated architectonically. Based on similar patterns of connections, DLC extends from dorsolateral to ventrolateral cortex. DLC receives strong, feedforward input from V II and projects in a feedforward fashion to the rostral subdivision of DL (DLR) and caudal inferior temporal (IT) cortex, including a separate location in the inferior temporal sulcus. DLC has weaker connections with V I, the middle temporal area (MT), cortex rostral to MT in the location of the fundal superior temporal area (FST), cortex dorsal to DLC, ventral cortex rostral to V II, and cortex in the frontal lobe, lateral to the inferior arcuate sulcus. Only lateral DLC has connections with V I, and only dorsolateral DLC has connections with cortex dorsal to DLC. The topographic organization of DLC was inferred from its connections with V II. Thus, dorsolateral DLC represents the lower field, lateral DLC represents central vision, and ventrolateral DLC represents the upper field. Limited observations were made on DLR. Confirming earlier observations (Cusick and Kaas: Visual Neurosci. 1:211, 1988), DLR is paler than DLC myeloarchitectonically. DLR receives only sparse feedforward input from V II, but stronger input from DLC. DLR has strong connections with cortex just rostral to dorsal V II, ventral posterior parietal cortex in the sylvian fissure, MT, the medial superior temporal area, FST, and the inferior temporal sulcus. DLR also shares connections with IT cortex. Thus, while both DLC and DLR are involved in the pathway relaying visual information to IT cortex, an area specialized for object vision, DLR also projects densely to areas such as MT involved in the pathway relaying to posterior parietal cortex, a region specialized for spatial localization and motion perception. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To determine whether these are elements of a common signal-transduction pathway, the effect of three PTK inhibitors on the rise in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines was assessed. Tyrphostin completely suppressed the increase in [Ca2+]i and the generation of inositol phosphates induced by ligation of membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) M. Herbimycin and genistein reduced by 30% and 50%, respectively, the rise in [Ca2+]i caused by optimal ligation of mIgM, and they abolished it in cells activated by suboptimal ligation of mIgM. Tyrphostin had no effect on the capacity of aluminum fluoride to increase [Ca2+]i. To determine whether a function of PTK is the phosphorylation of PLC, immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-phosphotyrosine from detergent lysates of B-lymphoblastoid cells were assayed for PLC activity. Ligation of mIgM increased immunoprecipitable PLC activity 2-fold by 90 sec and 4-fold by 30 min. Specific immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis identified tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma 1 isoform of PLC after 60 sec of stimulation. Activation of PLC in B cells by mIgM requires PTK function and is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1, suggesting a mechanism of PLC activation similar to that described for certain receptor PTKs. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Our study dealt with the functional characteristics of neutrophil leukocytes in the gingival fluid and in the peripheral blood. These were found markedly reduced in the RPP group, while, in the AP group, they were comparable to those of a healthy control group. No difference between local and systemic values was detected. Moreover, some samples of subgingival plaque were taken from two groups of patients, affected by AP and RPP respectively. The above samples showed a predominance of Gram-negative flora over Gram-positive flora, and of anaerobic flora over the aerobic one, and the predominance of specific pathogens in each of the two forms of periodontal disease. The subgingival plaque samples taken at the end of the periodontal treatment from five out of ten patients affected by RPP showed inverse ratios, as well as the absence of the previously detected pathogens. The findings underline the relevance of tests of leukocytes functionality and that of microbiological analysis to allow correct diagnosis of dubious forms of periodontal disease and the checking of the posttreatment results. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

PD patients of normal mental status as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination performed normally on the naming, line orientation, and verbal recognition memory tests but exhibited deficits on verbal recall. On tests of frontal lobe function, these patients showed mild deficits on a category fluency task and on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. However, their errors on the latter were not typical of patients with frontal lesions, and they performed normally on a letter fluency task and exhibited normal release from proactive interference. Patients of lower than normal mental status performed poorly on nearly all of the cognitive tasks including confrontational naming, line orientation, and recognition memory, suggesting that their cerebral dysfunction extended beyond subcortical-frontal circuits. The present study supports the usefulness of the Mini-Mental State Examination for cognitive screening of PD patients, but does not support the hypothesis that the cognitive impairments in PD arise principally from disruption of frontal lobe functioning. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

To identify the molecular basis of this abnormality, the Ca2+ release channel from both normal and MHS sarcoplasmic reticulum was examined using proteolytic digestion followed by immunoblot staining with a polyclonal antibody against the rabbit Ca2+ release channel protein. Under appropriate conditions, trypsin digestion of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from the two types of pigs revealed a distinct difference in the immunostaining pattern of the Ca2+ release channel-derived peptides. An approximate 86-kDa peptide was the predominant fragment in normal sarcoplasmic reticulum while an approximate 99-kDa peptide fragment was the major peptide detected in MHS sarcoplasmic reticulum. Digestion of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from four normal and four MHS pigs showed that the differences were highly reproducible. Trypsin digestion of sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from heterozygous pigs, which contain one normal and one MHS allele, showed an antibody staining pattern that was intermediate between MHS and normal sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results can be explained by a primary amino acid sequence difference between the normal and MHS Ca2+ release channels and support the hypothesis that a mutation in the gene coding for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel is responsible for malignant hyperthermia. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After extraction with alkali and detergent, the zymosan particles retained their ability to be opsonized in serum and to stimulate PMNs. Serum-treated zymosan (STZ) induced dose-dependent superoxide (O2-) production and membrane potential depolarization in the range of 1 to 10 mg/mL of STZ. The rate and extent of secretion of lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase were also dose-dependent in the range of 1 to 10 mg/mL of STZ. Cytochemical studies using nitroblue tetrazolium, however, showed that 92% of PMNs were stimulated to produce O2- at 0.1 mg/mL of STZ. The dose response of O2- production induced by STZ is therefore due to increasing O2- production by individual PMNs and not to the stimulation of more PMNs to produce O2-. Evidence for O2- production was found only in the area of PMN-zymosan contact, suggesting a mechanism for the graded responses of PMNs treated with particulate stimuli. In order to determine the nature of the dose dependence of depolarization (a measure of PMN activation), PMNs equilibrated with the fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that STZ induces a dose-dependent depolarization of the membrane potential of individual PMNs. These results also demonstrate that increasing concentrations of STZ can induce increasing PMN responses even when all of the PMNs have been activated. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that receptor-mediated particulate stimulation of PMNs is a phenomenon that results in graded PMN responses. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The network, composed of 7 x 7 neurons, was trained with the Kohonen unsupervised learning algorithm using, as inputs, matrix patterns derived from the bipeptide composition of 447 proteins, belonging to 13 different families. As a result of the training, and without any a priori indication of the number or composition of the expected families, the network self-organized the activation of its neurons into topologically ordered maps in which almost all the proteins (96.7%) were correctly clustered into the corresponding families. In a second computational experiment, a similar network was trained with one family of the previous learning set (76 cytochrome c sequences). The new neural map clustered these proteins into 25 different neurons (five in the first experiment), wherein phylogenetically related sequences were positioned close to each other. This result shows that the network can adapt the clustering resolution to the complexity of the learning set, a useful feature when working with an unknown number of clusters. Although the learning stage is time consuming, once the topological map is obtained, the classification of new proteins is very fast. Altogether, our results suggest that this novel approach may be a useful tool to organize the search for homologies in large macromolecular databases. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Among examined WHV carriers, 8 animals developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The sera were tested by indirect immunofluorescence for autoantibodies against smooth muscle (SMA), nuclei (ANA), brush border of proximal renal tubuli (ABBA), and mitochondria (AMA). Analysis revealed that inoculation with WHV was followed by the appearance and/or meaningful elevation of the titre of SMA in IgG class. In all 18 experimentally infected woodchucks, the autoantibody rise preceded the appearance of viral serologic markers (WHsAg and/or WHeAg) by 1 to 4 weeks (mean +/- SD = 2.5 +/- 1.5 weeks). Once induced, SMA remained steadily detectable achieving the peak titre value around week 12 postinoculation. The SMA dynamics did not parallel with the fluctuation of the virus serologic markers and they were similar both in animals who recovered from acute episodes and in those who progressed to chronic infection. In chronic carriers, contrasted to acute infection, fluctuation of SMA titre even to undetectable levels and frequent parallel rises and falls of SMA, ANA, and ABBA titres were observed. A different pattern was found in all three chronic carriers who acquired infection from mothers. In this group, high and relatively stable autoantibody levels were detected. Development of hepatocellular carcinoma was not associated with any specific autoantibody pattern. This study revealed that WHV invasion undoubtedly induces non-organ specific autoimmune response.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these \"tumor-seeking missiles\" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ten weeks after blinding, the expected gonadal involution and reduction of circulating levels of T4, as well as a reduction of circulating levels of corticosterone, were observed. T4 treatment significantly increased testicular weights, but it did not prevent gonadal involution. Neither PTU nor T4 administration significantly influenced the inhibition of serum corticosterone levels observed in blinded hamsters. The increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) observed in hypothyroid (PTU-treated) hamsters was significantly greater in intact hamsters than in blind hamsters. Blinding was associated with a small but highly significant increase in ratios of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) to serotonin (5HT) in extracts of the medial basal hypothalamus. Based on the assumption that 5HIAA represents primarily intraneuronal metabolism of excess 5HT, the present results are consistent with reduced 5HT release in blinded hamsters. Daily evening melatonin administration also increased the 5HIAA/5HT ratios of the mediobasal hypothalamus concurrently with gonadal involution, reduction of circulating levels of T4, and reduction of circulating levels of corticosterone. These results are consistent with the view that serotonergic neurons entering the hypothalamus are components of the photoneuroendocrine system of the hamster. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has recently been recognized that members of the stress protein family are synthesized constitutively and subserve functions that are critical to protein folding during intracellular transport. In this study we examined the expression of heat shock/stress proteins in human mononuclear phagocytes, cells dependent on intracellular transport for Ag processing, Ag presentation, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, and secretion of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory polypeptides. The results indicate that there are distinct patterns in expression of individual members of the highly homologous SP70, SP90, and ubiquitin gene families during different stress states. There is a marked increase in expression of the heat-inducible form of SP70 and SP90 in human monocytes during heat shock. Expression of GRP 78/BiP and GRP 94 increases predominantly during glucose starvation but also increases during heat shock. Ubiquitin gene expression increases during both heat shock and glucose starvation. There is no change in synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 or of the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 during heat shock or glucose starvation. Synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 and novel SP 90-like polypeptides increase during endotoxin-mediated inflammatory activation.

This product is structurally identical among the different classes of coelenterates: Hydrozoa (the jellyfish, Aequorea), Anthozoa (the sea cactus, Cavernularia; sea pansy, Renilla; and sea pen, Leioptilus), and very likely also the Scyphozoa (the jellyfish, Pelagia). In each of these instances the reaction product, namely, 2-(p-hydroxy-pnenylacetyl)amino-3-benzyl-5-(p-hydroxyphenyl) pyrazine, is the actual light-emitter, whether it occurs in a Ca2+-triggered photoprotein type of luminescence, or in a \"luciferin-luciferase\" type. The evidence indicates that in certain coelenterates, e.g., Cavernularia, these two types are equally significant, whereas in others (Renilla and Leioptilus) the \"luciferin-luciferase\" type predominates over the Ca-triggerable photoprotein type, and finally that only the photoprotein type functions in the luciferaseless jellyfish, Aequorea. In all instances investigated, the structure of the light-emitter prior to the luminescence reaction appears to be essentially the same as that of the chromophore of unreacted aequorin. The product of the luminescence reaction is absent in extracts of non luminous species.

To elucidate the histogenesis of hepatocytes a sequential study was undertaken using morphologic, histochemical, immunochemical, in situ hybridization, and Northern blot analysis. Male F-344 rats weighing 80 to 90 g were fed CuDT for 8 weeks and returned to normal rat chow. Beginning from 4 weeks of copper depletion, there was a progressive loss of acinar cells and by 8 weeks more than 90% of the acinar tissue was lost. During this period, there was an increase in the number of adipocytes in the interstitium, and in the number of interstitial and ductular cells. Morphologic observations were confirmed by immunoblot and Northern blot analysis, in which the amount of pancreatic proteins and their mRNAs decreased between 5 and 8 weeks. During this period, a progressive increase in the level of albumin mRNA was observed. In situ hybridization, performed at 7 weeks of copper deficiency, showed localization of albumin mRNA over interstitial and ductular cells. Pancreatic hepatocytes were identified immediately after the rats were returned to a normal diet and gradually increased in number. The hepatocytes occupied almost 60% of the pancreatic volume by 8 weeks. During the early recovery phase, hepatocytes were identified in ductules as well as in the interstitium. Based on these studies, it is concluded that both the ductular cells and interstitial cells, which resemble oval cells of liver, are capable of transforming into pancreatic hepatocytes and these cells may be considered stem-cell equivalent. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 were determined by radioimmunoassay on purified faecal and rectal dialysates at entry, at two weeks, and at two, six, and 12 months. If the above concentrations exceeded control concentrations (0.5 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml in faecal and rectal fluid, respectively) at any study day, the patient was allocated at random to double blind treatment with sulphasalazine 2 g/day, or placebo for six months. A relapse, defined as recurrence of symptoms accompanied by endoscopic inflammation occurred in none of six and in four of five patients allocated to sulphasalazine and placebo, respectively (p less than 0.05). In no case a normal rectal prostaglandin E2 concentration was associated with a relapse in the short term, but only two of 12 patients observed passively remained in remission. In retrospect, leukotriene B4 was a less sensitive predictor of relapse than prostaglandin E2.

A continuously increasing trend has been anticipated for quite some time and an observation of international trends and differentials in the mortality, morbidity and survival from ovarian cancer is provided. Recent data on mortality and morbidity were obtained from the WHO and IARC data banks. Globally, ovarian cancer had moderate or relatively low rates for both mortality (1.5-10 per 100,000) and incidence (4-15 per 100,000), using standardized (world) rates. The ranges were the narrowest among all major cancers. The observed pattern of long-term trends was classified into three types: 1) increase followed by a plateau, then a decrease, 2) steady increase, and 3) uncertain. The rate was seen to be fairly high in the first group and still low in the second while it fluctuated in the third. A decrease of the rates in younger age-groups has extended to upper age-groups in countries with the first type of trend. Germ-cell tumours appeared more frequently in younger ages and low-incidence areas, while the common \"epithelial\" cancers were more apparent in older age-groups and high-incidence areas. The geographical differences seem to be smaller for germ cell carcinomas than the common \"epithelial\" carcinomas which may be associated more with environmental risk factors. Five-year survival rates improved to a range of 25-41% in the latter half of the 1970s. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By virtue of these sites, antigens, MHC molecules, and TCRs constitute trimolecule complexes which eventually result in T cell activation. In our previous reports, we have defined that residues 46 and 54 on synthetic peptide composed of residues 43-58 of pigeon cytochrome c (p43-58, AEGFSYTDANKNKGIT) and its analogs function as an agretope and residue 50 as an epitope in both I-Ab and I-Ak-carrying mice. In the present study, to extend our method to the other MHC class II molecules (I-E), we used two peptide antigens, 46D50V54R and 50V54R, which had been prepared by substitution of amino acids at positions, 46, 50 and 54 or 50 and 54 of p43-58 D, V, R or V, R, respectively, and compared the immunogenicity with those of other peptide analogs. The 46D50V54R was shown to be non-immunogenic in I-Ab-carrying mice and the 50V54R was non-immunogenic in I-Ak-carrying mice. In contrast, the 46D50V54R or 50V54R could induce I-E-restricted proliferative responses of T lymphocytes in I-Eb/k- or I-Ek/k-carrying mice, respectively. Furthermore, residues 46 and 54 were shown to function as agretopes and residue 50 as an epitope in the I-E-restricted responses as they did in the I-A-restricted responses, even though some differences were seen between peptide-I-E interaction and peptide-I-A interaction.

Analysis of the results showed that (1) despite a decrease in esophageal tone, lung recoil pressures at all lung volumes were decreased by these compounds, (2) this change, in contrast to bronchodilation, was observed only when high doses were inhaled, and (3) this effect appeared rapidly and elapsed after approximately 30 min, whereas bronchodilation remained stable for at least 2 hours. Additional studies with intravenous infusion of the drug indicated that the effects of beta adrenergic agonists on the pressure-volume characteristics of the lungs are related to the amount of the drug delivered to the peripheral segments of the lung. These findings suggested that large doses of beta-2 agonist aerosols can cause sufficient relaxation of the contractile elements of the lung parenchyma to produce alterations in the static elastic properties of the lungs. In contrast to bronchodilation, which results from a topical action of inhaled particles, these alterations are probably a systemic effect of these aerosols, related to the quantity of the drug absorbed into the circulation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to understand the mechanism of this interaction, it is important to know the peptide structure, not only in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer environment, but also at the bilayer surface and in solution. To investigate this problem we have measured the secondary structure of the 11-residue neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its fragments in aqueous solutions, in membrane mimetic solvents, and associated with lipid bilayers using Raman and CD spectroscopy. Raman and CD spectra of SP bound to liposomes indicate a less than 20% helix content. We interpret these results to indicate that SP contains virtually no helix when bound to negatively charged liposomes. These spectra are similar to spectra of peptides in type I and III beta-turns. SP forms between 10 and 30% (1-3 residues) helical structure in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and less than 10% helix in methanol and trifluoroethanol. The binding of SP to negatively charged liposomes significantly changes the structure of the lipid acyl chains, decreasing order in some cases and increasing it in others. Raman spectra of SP in water indicates that SP near 30 mM forms an ensemble of structures in water that is distinct from completely unfolded peptide and from the aggregated beta-sheet form observed in saline solutions. We conclude from our CD results that methods used to quantitate secondary structure from CD spectra of short peptides cannot be used to distinguish between very short helical segments and beta-turns. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to elucidate a possible mechanism of formation of the hybrid alpha-amylases, 14C-labeled alpha-amylase (SAC) produced by B. subtilis var. amylosarcchariticus, [3H]lysine- and [3H]arginine-labeled alpha-amylases (MAR, NA64, NA20, NAT and SAC), [3H]lysine-labeled alpha-amylase (SAC) and [3H]glucosamine-labeled alpha-amylase (NA64) were purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation, carboxy-methylcellulose and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography and immunoprecipitation with rabbit antiserum against alpha-amylase (SAC). Peptide compositions of the tryptic digests from the labeled alpha-amylases were analyzed by double-label AG 50W-X2 column chromatography. On the other hand, amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acid residues of unlabeled alpha-amylases (MAR, NA64, NA20 and NAT) were analyzed. Based on these results, the possibility of DNA recombination events in the alpha-amylase structure gene and on the previous results, we attempted to estimate possible peptide arrangements for the four alpha-amylases (MAR, NA64, NA20 and NAT) and possible recombination regions to form the hybrid enzymes introduced by the DNA-mediated transformation of B. subtilis 6160. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Inhibition of fibrinolysis may occur at the level of plasmin or at the level of the activators. Fibrinolysis in human blood seems to be regulated by specific molecular interactions between these components. In plasma, normally no systemic plasminogen activation occurs. When fibrin is formed, small amounts of plasminogen activator and plasminogen adsorb to the fibrin, and plasmin is generated in situ. The formed plasmin, which remains transiently complexed to fibrin, is only slowly inactivated by alpha 2-antiplasmin, while plasmin, which is released from digested fibrin, is rapidly and irreversibly neutralized. The fibrinolytic process, thus, seems to be triggered by and confined to fibrin. Thrombus formation may occur as the result of insufficient activation of the fibrinolytic system and (or) the presence of excess inhibitors, while excessive activation and/or deficiency of inhibitors might cause excessive plasmin formation and a bleeding tendency. Evidence obtained in animal models suggests that tissue-type plasminogen activator, obtained by recombinant DNA technology, may constitute a specific clot-selective thrombolytic agent with higher specific activity and fewer side effects than those currently in use. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cytotoxicity, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, was found to be directly proportional to alkyl chain length and surface tension lowering activity. L-Methionine decyl and dodecyl ester hydrochlorides possessed optimum cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 29, 28 microM) which was not reversible by the addition of L-methionine. Surface tension of a 50 microM solution of the decyl and dodecyl ester hydrochlorides were 35.4 and 32.7 dyn/cm, respectively. The corresponding decyl and dodecyl ester tosylates and amide hydrochlorides were less active. The N-t-butoxycarbonyl analogues were essentially inactive, demonstrating the necessity of an unsubstituted and/or potentially cationic amino group. Methionine dependence characteristics and cytotoxicity were also determined for three human (IMR-90, LX-1, MCF7) and four additional murine (L1210, L5178Y, 3T3, SV-T2) cell lines. The human cell lines Meth A, LX-1, and SV-T2 were found to be methionine independent. The LX-1 tumor cell line and the SV-T2 transformed line exhibited two to four times more sensitivity to the cytotoxic and cytolytic properties of the decyl and dodecyl ester hydrochlorides than their normal counterparts. The dodecyl amide hydrochloride derivative demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic activity in vivo relative to the corresponding ester, possibly due to decreased metabolic hydrolysis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Step depolarizations in the presence of tetrodotoxin and hexamethonium triggered two Ca2+ currents that differed in the voltage dependence of activation and kinetics of inactivation. These currents resemble the L and N currents previously described in chicken sensory neurons [Nowycky, M. C., Fox, A. P. & Tsien, R. W. (1985) Nature (London) 316, 440-442]. Treatment with acetylcholine resulted in the rapid (within seconds), selective, and reversible inhibition of the rapidly inactivated, N-type current, whereas the long-lasting L-type current remained unaffected. The high sensitivity to blocker drugs (atropine, pirenzepine) indicated that this effect of acetylcholine was due to a muscarinic M1 receptor. Intracellular perfusion with nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogs or pretreatment of the neurons with pertussis toxin had profound effects on the Ca2+ current modulation. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate caused the disappearance of the N-type current (an effect akin to that of acetylcholine, but irreversible), whereas guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate and pertussis toxin pretreatment prevented the acetylcholine-induced inhibition. In contrast, cAMP, applied intracellularly together with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as well as activators and inhibitors of protein kinase C, were without effect. Acetylcholine caused shortening of action potentials in neurons treated with tetraethylammonium to partially block K+ channels. Moreover, when applied to neurons loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura-2, acetylcholine failed to appreciably modify [Ca2+]i at rest but caused a partial blunting of the initial [Ca2+]i peak induced by depolarization with high K+. This effect was blocked by muscarinic antagonists and pertussis toxin and was unaffected by protein kinase activators. Thus, muscarinic modulation of the N-type Ca2+ channels appears to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein and independent of both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In controls, none of the monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated NF stained the perikaryon of neurons. In contrast, in animals treated with Al, all neuronal perikarya containing Al-induced neurofilament bundles (NB) and some lacking well-formed NB immunoreacted with two of the five antibodies to phosphorylated NF. Axons were stained by all five antibodies to phosphorylated NF in both control and Al-treated animals. A broadly reacting monoclonal antibody to a nonphosphorylated NF epitopes immunoreacted with neuronal cell bodies, dendrites and axons in control and Al-intoxicated animals regardless of the presence of Al-induced NB. Staining of Al-induced NB with one of the antibodies to phosphorylated NF was greatly diminished after treatment of sections with trypsin and phosphatase. It is concluded that NF which compose the Al-induced NB have different immunocytochemical characteristics from those of the NF present in the perikaryon of normal neurons. It is likely that, contrary to normal perikaryal NF, NF of Al-induced NB are phosphorylated. Moreover, phosphorylation of NF of Al-induced NB is probably abnormal, since NF of Al-induced NB have immunostaining characteristics different from NF of normal axons. Al-induced NB may result from abnormal phosphorylation of NF in the perikaryon, preventing normal axonal transport of these structures. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The three toxin components, edema factor (EF), protective antigen (PA), and lethal factor (LF), were tested alone and in various combinations for their effect on PMN chemotaxis under agarose to formyl peptides and zymosan-activated serum. No component was active alone; combinations of EF + PA, LF + PA, and EF + LF + PA markedly stimulated chemotaxis (directed migration), but had little or no effect on unstimulated random migration. The toxin components were not themselves chemoattractants. EF in combination with PA had previously been identified as an adenylate cyclase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that EF + PA produced detectable cyclic adenosine 3'-5'monophosphate (cAMP) in PMN, but the level of cAMP was less than 1% of that produced in CHO cells by EF + PA, and in PMN by other bacterial adenylate cyclases. LF + PA (which stimulated chemotaxis to an equivalent extent) had no effect on cAMP levels. Thus, the enhancement of chemotaxis by anthrax toxin (at least by LF + PA) does not seem to be related to adenylate cyclase activity. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

However, low-grade transmission of Plasmodium falciparum continues, with periodic focal outbreaks after abnormally high rainfall. From October 1973 to September 1976, the operational and epidemiological factors involved in this residual transmission were studied in over 17 000 people of an area of northern Transvaal. Incidence surveys based on the screening of fever cases revealed 42 autochthonous cases of malaria in 1974-75 and 10 cases in 1975-76. Parasite prevalence surveys were not sensitive enough to assess the malaria situation, and serological testing indicated different levels of infection according to the method used. One of the two principal vectors of malaria in Africa-Anopheles funestus Giles-was not detected in the project area, and the A. gambiae group (species A and B) was found in extremely low numbers, so that it could not have accounted for the low-grade transmission in the area. A recently discovered member of the A. funestus group somewhat resembling A. aruni Sobti, and a species hitherto undiscovered in the Transvaal, which is abundant in the area and is indistinguishable from A. flavicosta Edwards, may be involved. Both were found biting man-mostly outdoors during the four hours following dusk, when people frequently gather outside their houses and are thus vulnerable to mosquito bites. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Human studies have shown that this \"first pass metabolism\" of ethanol correlates quite closely with gastric ADH activity which has been demonstrated to be greater in men than women. The present study was undertaken to determine if gender influences the magnitude of ethanol-induced injury in rat gastric mucosa and whether any differences can be linked to altered levels of ADH activity. Since prostaglandins (PGs) have been shown to markedly attenuate the severity of gastric injury induced by ethanol in the rat stomach, a further goal of this study was to determine whether the efficiency of PG\\'s protective action was in any way influenced by gender. Accordingly, both male and female rats were pretreated subcutaneously with 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (10 micrograms/kg) or saline 30 minutes prior to administering an oral dose of 50% ethanol in saline or saline alone. They were then sacrificed 5 minutes later. In a portion of animals (n = 6 per group), samples of mucosa from the glandular stomach were obtained and kinetic activity of ADH determined. In another portion of animals (n = 6 per group), gastric tissue samples from the glandular mucosa were examined by light microscopy and the magnitude of mucosal injury quantified. Alcohol-treated females showed significantly (p less than 0.05) less superficial and more deep mucosal injury than male counterparts. Further, ADH kinetic activity in female rats was significantly less than that observed in male counterparts of similar weight (83% of males; p less than 0.04).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved electronegative Glu441,Ile442,Glu443 domain to Gly441,Ile442,Gln443 drastically reduced the rate of butyrylthiocholine (BTCh) hydrolysis and caused pronounced resistance to dibucaine binding. These findings implicate the charged Glu441,Ile442,Glu443 domain as necessary for a functional CHE catalytic triad as well as for binding quinoline derivatives. Asp70 to Gly substitution characteristic of 'atypical' BCHE, failed to alter its Km towards BTCh or dibucaine binding but reduced hydrolytic activity to 25% of control. Normal hydrolytic activity was restored to Gly70 BCHE by additional His114 or Tyr561 mutations, both of which co-appear with Gly70 in natural BCHE variants, which implies a likely selection advantage for these double BCHE mutants over the single Gly70 BCHE variant. Gly70 BCHE variants also displayed lower binding as compared with Asp70 BCHE to cholinergic drugs, certain choline esters and solanidine. These effects were ameliorated in part by additional mutations or in binding solanidine complexed with sugar residues. These observations indicate that structural interactions exist between N' and C' terminal domains in CHEs which contribute to substrate and inhibitor binding and suggest a crucial involvement of both electrostatic and hydrophobic domains in the build-up of the CHE active center. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The C-terminus of this domain was determined by treatment with carboxypeptidase Y and shown to be identical with the C-terminus of E2. Together with the previously determined N-terminus and the known amino acid sequence of E2, a molecular mass of 27.5 kDa was calculated. From the molecular mass of the native catalytic domain, 530 kDa, and the symmetry of the cubic structures observed on electron micrographs, a 24-meric structure is concluded instead of the 32-meric structure proposed previously. From the effect of guanidine hydrochloride on the light-scattering of intact E2 it was concluded that dissociation occurs in a two-step reaction resulting in particles with an average mass 1/6 that of the original mass before the N----D transition takes place. Cross-linking experiments with the catalytic domain indicated that the multimeric E2 is built from tetramers and that the tetramers are arranged as a dimer of dimers. A model for the quaternary structure of E2 is given, in which it is assumed that the tetrameric E2 core of PDC is formed from each of the six morphological subunits located at the lateral face of the cube. Binding of peripheral components to a site that interferes with the cubic assembly causes dissociation, resulting in the unique small PDC of A. vinelandii. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The structurally similar vinyl monomer acrylonitrile (ACN) does not induce dominant lethal mutations but does induce tumors of the brain, Zymbal gland, forestomach and mammary gland, but not the liver of rats. Several in vitro and/or in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays were employed to examine the potential tissue-specific genotoxic activity of these compounds. Neither AA nor ACN induced DNA repair in either the in vitro or in vivo hepatocyte DNA repair assays. Glycidamide (GA), a mutagenic metabolite of AA, induced DNA repair in the in vitro hepatocyte DNA repair assay. Cyanoethylene oxide (CEO), a mutagenic metabolite of ACN, did not yield a DNA repair response in the in vitro hepatocyte DNA repair assay, but was highly toxic and could not be tested at doses equivalent to GA. AA, but not ACN, produced a DNA repair response in the in vivo spermatocyte DNA repair assay. AA produced a slight response in the in vitro human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) DNA repair assay in normal cells derived from discarded surgical samples from five different women. GA produced a strong UDS response in all cases in the same assay. CEO, but not its parent compound ACN, produced a response in the HMEC DNA repair assay. These results show a highly tissue-specific pattern of genotoxic activity for AA and ACN that correlates, to the extent that it has been examined, with the tissue-specific pattern of carcinogenic and dominant lethal activity. The induction of DNA repair by GA and CEO confirms the genotoxic potential of these metabolites. While the observation of genotoxic activity of AA in the HMEC DNA repair assay suggests that mammary cells might be a target for carcinogenic activity of this compound in humans, other factors such as pharmacokinetics and epidemiology must be evaluated to establish that effect. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results obtained for the two complexes are compared to each other, to the crystal structures of related DNA-echinomycin complexes, and to enzymatic and chemical footprinting results. In the saturated complexes, two echinomycin molecules bind to each octamer by bisintercalation of the quinoxaline moieties on either side of each CpG step. Binding of echinomycin to the octamer [d(ACGTACGT)]2 is cooperative so that only the two-drug complex is observed at lower drug-DNA ratios, but binding to [d(TCGATCGA)]2 is not cooperative. At low temperatures, both the internal and terminal A.T base pairs adjacent to the binding site in the [d(ACGTACGT)]2-2 echinomycin complex are Hoogsteen base paired (Gilbert et al., 1989) as observed in related crystal structures. However, as the temperature is raised, the internal A.T Hoogsteen base pairs are destabilized and are observed to be exchanging between the Hoogsteen base-paired and an open (or Watson-Crick base-paired) state. In contrast, in the [d(TCGATCGA)]2-2 echinomycin complex, no A.T Hoogsteen base pairs are observed, the internal A.T base pairs appear to be stabilized by drug binding, and the structure of the complex does not change significantly from 0 to 45 degrees C. Thus, the structure and stability of the DNA in echinomycin-DNA complexes depends on the sequence at and adjacent to the binding site. While we conclude that no single structural change in the DNA can explain all of the footprinting results, unwinding of the DNA helix in the drug-DNA complexes appears to be an important factor while Hoogsteen base pair formation does not. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The prevalence of screen-positive alcoholism, by department, was as follows: medicine (25%), psychiatry (30%), neurology (19%), obstetrics-gynecology (12.5%), and surgery (23%). Detection rates by the house staff and faculty physicians caring for those patients who screened positively were less than 25% in surgery and obstetrics-gynecology, between 25% and 50% in neurology and medicine, and greater than 50% in psychiatry. However, physicians were less likely to identify as alcoholic those patients with higher incomes, higher education, or private medical insurance; women; and those who denied heavy alcohol intake. Physician-instituted treatment rates for those patients diagnosed by the physician as having nonrecovered alcoholism were less than 50% in surgery and obstetrics-gynecology, between 50% and 75% in medicine and neurology, and 100% in psychiatry. The extent to which the physicians intervened while the patient was hospitalized correlated with the patient's reported change in alcohol use after discharge.

In addition to the C-type retrovirus particles related to Rauscher murine leukemia virus (MuLV) previously reported to bud from these cells we observed cytoplasmic A-type particles and intracisternal A-type particles (IAP). In the cytoplasm the A-type particles occur in large clusters often associated with sheets of material with a fine structure resembling the shells of the particles. At the plasma membrane individual A-type particles bud to give rise to extracellular virions. The IAP are restricted to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) into which they bud: they are not transported out of the RER to the Golgi apparatus and beyond. We describe a new monoclonal antibody (designated 83E7) which is specific for an epitope of the major core protein (MTVp27) of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Using immunogold labelling procedures we have specifically labelled both the A-type particles and the associated sheets of material with this antibody. We conclude that the A-type particles and the virions they give rise to are MMTV. The sheets of material must also at least in part be made up of the major core protein of MMTV or its precursor polypeptide.

Scurvy, beri-beri, and pellagra, once serious scourges, are now seen only rarely. The severe forms of protein-energy malnutrition, kwashiorkor and marasmus, have also decreased greatly. Nonetheless, mild to moderate forms of protein-energy deficiency, exacerbated by infection, continue to impair growth and development in a majority of the low-income pre-school age populations of most developing countries. Deficiencies of iron, iodine, and vitamin A are still widespread in developing countries. Fortunately, the success of the WHO/UNICEF \"Child Survival and Development Revolution\" in persuading most developing countries to introduce expanded programs of immunization, growth monitoring, and appropriate feeding of young children, control of diarrheal disease, and specific campaigns against avitaminosis A, iodine deficiency disorders, and the functional consequences of iron deficiency, will accelerate the decline of acute deficiency diseases in the developing world. Diets are changing among the more affluent in these countries, however, and it is time for them to stress dietary goals for the health of rich and poor alike. For the first time there is enough information regarding dietary risk factors for chronic disease to provide an opportunity in the 1990s to accelerate the dietary changes that have already brought significant health benefits to some populations in North America and Europe. The changes, which include a lower dietary intake of fat, particularly saturated fat, less salt, and more green and yellow vegetable and whole grain cereals, can be expected to influence favorably morbidity from cardiovascular diseases and some kinds of cancer. For maximum benefit, these measures need to be combined with the avoidance of obesity, reasonable physical activity, abstention from, or moderate use of, alcohol, and avoidance of tobacco in any form. Since there is already considerable momentum toward these changes in North America and some European countries, the 1990s are likely to see substantial further progress in the reduction of chronic diseases known to be influenced by diet. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Spots appear noisy due to multiple transfer steps. If one applies standard 2D PAGE protein gel spot segmentation methods, spots fragment due to highly textured image noise and a weak radioautograph signal and thus are poorly detected. We have observed that these spots are all of a minimum size. Therefore an image processing filter which both takes minimum spot size into account and has immunity to image texture-type noise should be able to reliably detect this class of spots. The 'Busse' Laplacian filter used in the GELLAB-II system, is a modification of the standard (1-21) digital approximation of the Laplacian. In the Busse Laplacian, the sampling interval is n pixels (n greater than 1) instead of 1. In addition, 3 x 3 averaged 'super pixel' values are used instead of single pixels for each element of the Laplacian convolution. This gives the needed noise immunity by filtering out the high spatial frequency image noise while preserving the low spatial frequency character of the spots. We have used this filter successfully on 2D DNA Southern blot image data. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The purpose is to evaluate the importance of clumps and their site of formation in the metastatic process. The results demonstrate a negative exponential character for both the size distribution of effluent tumor clumps and the tumor vessel population. Tumor trauma or massage increases total tumor cells and clumps released into the effluent. Serial amputation demonstrates that tumor cells are continuously being released on a day-by-day basis in vivo. A linear relationship exists between the proportion of vessels with diameters large enough to pass a tumor clump of a given size and the proportion of clumps of that size within the venous effluent. Injection of tumor cells in clumps of 6 to 7 cells produces a significantly greater number of metaststic foci than does a similar number of single tumor cells; larger clumps produce significantly more metastatic foci than do smaller clumps matched for the number of cells. These studies verify the significance of tumor clumps in the metastatic process. It is suggested that tumor cell clumps arise locally within the vascular bed of the tumor. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The main facts concerning histological type, topography of the tumour, date of diagnosis, address, profession, O.B.O. and Rhesus groups, age and sex were codified for feeding into a computer and processed by sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis shows the homogeneity of topographical distribution in the brain of the different types of glioma, the special genetic code of meningiomas (predominance of A and B genes of the A.B.O. group), absence of the same factors for glioblastoma. Sex ratio analysis shows the contrast between definitely masculine tumours--glioblastomas and astrocytomas--and meningiomas and spongioblastomas. Analysis of the \"age specific rate\" separates tumours prevalent in the young, where incidence is a decreasing function of age (spongioblastoma, medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma) and tumours prevalent in adults which are mainly meningiomas and glioblastomas whose incidence is an increasing exponential function of age. Epidemiological analysis shows the difference in geographical distribution of glioblastomas and meningiomas. As far as glioblastomas are concerned, it would appear that on to the general rule of constant tumourincidence over the area as a whole, is superimposed another of high incidence in particular districts of the Beaujolais and Maconnais regions. The aetiological implications of these various findings are discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Male rats were castrated on days 1, 5 and 7 after birth. Their brains were processed for study on days 83-85. The neurons and cell nuclei of the preoptic area, mediobasal and ventromedial nuclei were assessed for changes in cell and nuclear sizes and dry weight (calculated using interferometric methods). Neonatal castration resulted in size as well as dry weight increase in the neurons of the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus. The dry weight increased by 34% (P less than 0.001) in the medial preoptic area, by 25% (P less than 0.001) in the arcuate neurons and by 22% (P less than 0.001) in the ventromedial nucleus. The cell nuclei exhibited perceptible weight increase too--in the medial preoptic area 68% (P less than 0.001); 55% in the arcuate neurons (P less than 0.001), and 39% in the ventromedial region. The weight and size increases in neonatally castrated males were equal to those of females of the same age. In rats castrated on day 7, the cell sizes and dry weights of the ventromedial nucleus increased but the cell nuclei exhibited only little change. It is assumed that the changes in the dry weight may be the result of increased synthetic processes in these groups of neurons which are connected with the tonic and cyclic release of gonadotropins. These changes also point to the hypothalamic differentiation shifting to the female type in the absence of the inducing effect of androgens. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The first report of the use of an antibiotic to select high producers of that antibiotic was done with the streptomycin producer. Mutational biosynthesis of new antibiotics originated with studies on the neomycin producer. The first demonstration of the presence of genes coding for antibiotic inactivation in antibiotic producers was made with Streptomyces griseus, the producer of streptomycin. Induction of an enzyme involved in secondary metabolism was found first with mannosidostreptomycinase. The first example of a nonprecursor molecule which could induce an entire antibiotic biosynthetic pathway was A-Factor involved in streptomycin production. Glucose repression and amino acid repression of mannosidostreptomycinase were the first examples of carbon catabolite repression and nitrogen metabolite repression respectively of an enzyme involved in secondary metabolism. Data supporting the occurrence of nitrogen metabolite regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis were first gathered in the early days of development of the streptomycin fermentation when it was found that the slowly used soybean meal and proline were the best nitrogen sources for antibiotic production. Aminoglycoside research also provided the first explanation of a mechanism of phosphate control of antibiotic biosynthesis. The first indication that antibiotic formation is not obligatory for spore formation was provided by data on streptomycin production. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The endotoxin-burn response was compared with that of endotoxin alone. Twenty-two adult sheep with chronic lung and flank lymph fistulas were studied. In 11 sheep a burn was produced under anesthesia and 3 days later they were given 2 micrograms/kg of endotoxin. Data were also compared with those of control sheep and those that were given burns alone. Circulating conjugated dienes increased with endotoxin alone but remained at baseline with endotoxin and burn injury. The lung lymph flow response was increased significantly in the endotoxin-burn group (sixfold) compared with that of endotoxin alone (fourfold). Histologic quantitation of lung neutrophil count was comparable in both groups 6 hours after injury, although mononuclear cells were much more evident in lungs in the endotoxin-burn group. Lipid peroxidation measured by malondialdehyde was significantly increased in the endotoxin group compared with the endotoxin-burn group, despite the greater increase in lymph flow and lung water in the burned group. Oxygen consumption (VO2) remained constant after endotoxin alone compared with baseline. However, VO2 increased twofold immediately after endotoxin in the endotoxin-burn group. This marked increase was followed by a significant decrease in VO2 from baseline. Flank soft-tissue nonburned increased lung lymph flow twofold to threefold with endotoxin and burn, indicating increased soft-tissue permeability, whereas it remained unchanged with endotoxin alone. Liver malondialdehyde increased from a control of 110 +/- 20 to 210 +/- 80 mmol/gm tissue with endotoxin alone and to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gm tissue with endotoxin and burn. We can conclude that burn injury accentuates both the pulmonary and systemic physiologic response to endotoxin, possibly as a result of mediators released from mononuclear cells already activated in the presence of the burn. The increased lung physiologic response does not appear to be caused by greater oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation, as was seen in the liver with the combined injury. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Aims of the present study were to assess the effects of antianginal drugs on dipyridamole-induced ischemia and to evaluate whether drug-induced changes in DET response may predict variations in exercise tolerance. Fifty-seven patients with angiographically assessed significant coronary artery disease (greater than 70% lumen reduction in at least one major coronary vessel) performed a DET and an exercise electrocardiography test (EET) in random order both off treatment and on antianginal drugs (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates, alone or in various combinations). The criterion for DET positivity was a transient dyssynergy of contraction absent or of a lesser degree in the baseline examination. In DET, two parameters were evaluated: the dipyridamole time (i.e., the time from onset of dipyridamole infusion to obvious dyssynergy) and the wall motion score index. DET sensitivity was 91% off therapy and fell to 65% under therapy (p less than 0.01). In the 37 patients who had a positive DET both off and on therapy, the dipyridamole time increased from 6 +/- 3 (off therapy) to 8 +/- 3 minutes (on therapy) (p less than 0.01). The wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole went from 1.38 +/- 0.14 to 1.31 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.01). EET and DET yielded concordant (positive versus negative) results in 41 of 57 (71%) patients off and in 35 of 57 (61%) on therapy (p = NS). In the subgroup of 38 patients with both positive DET and EET without treatment, the therapy-induced variations in exercise time were significantly correlated with the variations in dipyridamole time (r = 0.5; p less than 0.01), not with variations in wall motion score index (r = 0.3; p = NS). 1) Antianginal therapy can protect from dipyridamole-induced ischemia and 2) the therapy-induced changes in DET response parallel variations in exercise tolerance and might be useful for the objective, exercise-independent assessment of the therapy efficacy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We studied prospectively the clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings of 306 chronic male alcoholics in whom liver tissue was available. Tissue cholestasis permitted identification of two groups: group I, absent or mild cholestasis (239 patients), and group II, moderate to severe cholestasis (67 patients). Statistical evaluation was performed by Student's t test and regression analyses. In patients with tissue cholestasis, 97% had elevated serum cholylglycine levels, while only 61% had significant jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dl). In patients without tissue cholestasis, 66% had elevated serum cholylglycine and 13.5% jaundice. Highly significant statistical correlations (P less than 0.0001) were found between cholestasis and malnutrition, prothrombin time, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, Maddrey's discriminant function, serum cholylglycine level, albumin, and histologic severity score. In group I, 54% survived 60 months versus 22% in group II (P less than 0.0001). Highly significant statistical correlations (P less than 0.0001) were noted between serum cholylglycine levels and the parameters enumerated earlier, but not with survival. We conclude that tissue cholestasis is a highly significant prognostic indicator of outcome in alcoholic hepatitis and is more consistently associated with bile salt retention than jaundice. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The incidence of infection with H influenzae type b in certain populations, such as Apache and Navajo Indians and Alaskan Eskimos, is 10 to 20 times higher than in the general US population. Another important feature of H influenzae type b infections in these populations is that more than 80% of the cases occur during the first year of life, with 35% to 45% occurring during the first 6 months. One of the currently licensed vaccines that contains the capsular polysaccharide of the H influenzae type b organism is not reliably immunogenic in infants younger than 18 months of age. A number of new H influenzae type b vaccines prepared by covalently coupling the H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide with a protein carrier antigen are undergoing clinical evaluation. One of these conjugate vaccines was shown to be efficacious in preventing disease caused by H influenzae type b in Finnish infants when they were immunized at 3, 4, and 6 months of age. Unfortunately, in a recently concluded trial, the same vaccine was not found to be efficacious in preventing such disease in infants younger than 1 year of age among the Alaskan Eskimo population.

This study was carried out to investigate the mechanism by which GRF and SRIF regulate [Ca2+]i to control GH release. The roles of ion channels, cAMP-dependent processes, and protein kinase-C (PKC) were investigated by measuring changes in [Ca2+]i, 45Ca influx, and GH release when purified rat somatotrophs were exposed to high K+, cAMP analogs, prostaglandin E2, as well as the PKC activators 1,2-dioctanoyl-glycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. High K+ depolarization produced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i, while cAMP and prostaglandin E2 led to a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i. PKC activators produced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, followed by a decrease to below baseline. All secretagogues tested raised [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC), since the increases in [Ca2+]i were blocked by incubation in Ca2(+)-free medium and by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nifedipine. SRIF lowered [Ca2+]i by blocking the Ca2+ influx stimulated by all of these GH secretagogues except high K+. These results are consistent with the model in which GRF initiates its action by increasing Na+ conductance to depolarize the somatotroph via cAMP. This depolarization would stimulate Ca2+ influx through VSCC, which would result in the first phase of the GRF-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. This increase in [Ca2+]i would stimulate Ca2+ removal from the cytosol by activating Ca-ATPase via Ca-calmodulin and/or PKC. This would result in the lowering of [Ca2+]i to the plateau level of the second phase of the GRF response. SRIF prevents the GRF-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by increasing K+ conductance and, thus, hyperpolarizing the cell. Hyperpolarization would close VSCC, leading to a decrease in Ca2+ influx, with a subsequent drop in [Ca2+]i. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Urine samples from workers of an anode production plant exposed to coal tar and from psoriatic patients undergoing treatment with coal-tar ointments were tested for mutagenic activity on strain TA98 Salmonella typhimurium, in the presence of the microsome fraction and deconjugating enzymes. Parallelly, the urinary concentration of PAH metabolites or one of their trace metabolites, 1-hydroxypyrene, was determined. Increased levels of PAH metabolites were observed in the urine of anode production workers after a work shift compared with controls. Results of the plate test and the fluctuation test performed on urine of exposed subjects, both smokers and nonsmokers, showed mutagenicity values similar to the controls. Much higher 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations were found in the urine of psoriatic patients treated with coal tar than in post-shift urine of anode production workers. The urine of the former was also mutagenic in the 3 mutagenicity tests used. The minimum mean dose of PAH metabolites was calculated, expressed as quantity of 1-hydroxypyrene, that would give a mutagenic response in the 3 tests: the micropreincubation test was found to be about 100 times more sensitive than the plate test and about 30 times more sensitive than the fluctuation test. The theoretical minimum urinary concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene detectable by each test was determined: the micropreincubation test was 15 times more sensitive than the plate test and 7 times more sensitive than the fluctuation test.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This cellular-collagen complex is referred to as a fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL). In time, this FPCL undergoes a reduction in size called lattice contraction. The proposed mechanism for lattice contraction is cellular force produced by cytoplasmic microfilaments which organize collagen fibrils compacting the matrix. When the regulatory subunits of myosin, myosin light chains, are phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), myosin ATPase activity is increased and actin-myosin dynamic filament sliding occurs. Elevated levels of myosin ATPase are required for maximal lattice contraction. Cholera toxin inhibits lattice contraction by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP. It is proposed that increased cytoplasmic concentrations of cAMP promote phosphorylation of MLCK, the enzyme important for maximizing myosin ATPase activity. Phosphorylating MLCK in vitro inhibits activity by decreasing its sensitivity to calcium-calmodulin complex. A decrease in MLCK activity would result in lower levels of myosin ATPase activity. MLCK, purified from turkey gizzard, was subjected to limited proteolytic digestion to produce calmodulin-independent-MLCK. The partially digested kinase does not require calcium-calmodulin for activation. Independent-MLCK is not subject to inhibition by phosphorylation. The electroporetic inoculation of independent-MLCK into fibroblasts before FPCL manufacture produced enhanced lattice contraction. Lattice contraction, in the presence of cholera toxin, was restored to normal levels by the prior electroporetic introduction of independent-MLCK. These findings support the hypothesis that increases in cAMP hinder lattice contraction by a mechanism involving inhibition of MLCK and myosin ATPase. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has been speculated that after a foreign protein has undergone proteolytic processing, resulting peptides that can take on structures favorable for binding to histocompatibility proteins and for recognition by the T-cell receptor are immunodominant. DeLisi and Berzofsky (25) have proposed that the ability of a peptide fragment to fold as an amphipathic alpha-helix may increase the likelihood of its immunodominance. In an effort to understand how structure and immunodominance might be correlated, we have studied the biophysical properties of a series of peptides from sperm whale myoglobin (SWMb) which have already been characterized with respect to activation of T-cell clones from mice immunized against the whole protein. Our results suggest that peptides corresponding to immunodominant T-cell antigenic sites from SWMb tend to fold as amphipathic alpha-helices in structure-promoting and interfacial environments. Peptides with the sequences 132-146 and 102-118 were chosen for the study because they were found to be immunodominant for myoglobin-specific T cells (8) and were predicted to form amphipathic alpha-helices based on their residue distribution. Likewise, peptides with the sequences 93-102 and 115-130, which were predicted not to favor this conformation, were used as controls.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We designed this study to determine the effects of chronic intestinal venous hypertension (VHT), in isolation, on gut motility and absorption. In 10 dogs, a 20- to 25-cm loop of jejunum was isolated from the fecal stream, but myoneural continuity was maintained with the proximal bowel by a seromuscular bridge. In 5 dogs, VHT was created in the loop by a fixed stenosis of its venous drainage; a sham procedure was performed in a further 5 animals. Serosal monopolar electrodes were placed in all animals. Absorptive function and myoelectrical activity were studied over a 4-week period. Venous hypertension was achieved and sustained in the VHT animals; loop vein pressures for VHT vs control in cm H2O (means +/- SEM) are: initial--29.8 +/- 1.8 vs 7.5 +/- 0.4 (P less than 0.01), and at 4 weeks--17.6 +/- 6.88 vs 7.3 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.01). Absorption of Na+, Cl-, glucose, and water was impaired in VHT loops. Normal patterns of fasting and postprandial myoelectrical activity were preserved in the VHT animals. We conclude that chronic VHT, in the absence of portosystemic shunting, results in impaired absorption of water, glucose, and electrolytes without any change in intestinal motility. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

An estimate of the accessibility to acrylamide of the enzyme's single tryptophan residue (Trp140) was obtained from the Stern-Volmer constant for fluorescence quenching. This was indicative of a partially buried tryptophan in the wild-type nuclease. Five single-site mutant nucleases (H124L, V66L, G88V, G79S and F76V) and one double mutant (V66L + G88V), with widely differing stabilities to denaturants, gave Stern-Volmer constants which were very similar to that of their parent enzyme. Studies of the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of quenching suggest that access by acrylamide to Trp140 is limited by diffusion rather than by protein structural fluctuations. Lifetime-resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies using steady-state instrumentation suggest that there is very little segmental motion of the Trp140; most of the anisotropy therefore decays due to protein rotation in the solution. Rotational correlation times for several nuclease mutants have been determined and these are very similar to that of the native nuclease. Thus it appears that these substitutions in the primary amino acid sequence, which have significant effects on the stability of the folded proteins, do not cause a significant change in the protein structure or dynamics around Trp140. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The histopathology is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that keratinocyte proliferation and inflammation in psoriasis are manifestations of the same underlying pathological process. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a cytokine that is a major mediator of the host response to tissue injury and infection, is produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes in culture. IL-6 expression was studied in psoriatic plaques by immunoperoxidase staining with two different polyclonal anti-recombinant IL-6 antisera and by in situ nucleic acid hybridization with IL-6 cRNA probes. Epidermal and dermal cells in active psoriatic plaques from 35 psoriasis patients stained heavily for IL-6 as compared with nonlesional skin and with plaques after treatment with antimetabolic and antiinflammatory agents. Absorption of the anti-recombinant IL-6 antisera with purified fibroblast-derived IL-6 or with recombinant IL-6, but not bovine serum albumin, removed the immunostaining. Increased levels of IL-6 were detected in the plasma of patients with active psoriasis (mean 3 ng/ml) by using two different bioassays. IL-6 production by proliferating keratinocytes was suggested by IL-6-specific immunostaining in cultured normal and psoriatic keratinocytes and by the detection of mRNA specific for IL-6 in psoriatic epidermis by in situ hybridization. IL-6 stimulated the proliferation of cultured, normal human keratinocytes as assessed by two different assays. Thus, IL-6 could directly contribute to the epidermal hyperplasia seen in psoriatic epithelium as well as affect the function of dermal inflammatory cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

As a test of this hypothesis, we examined whether nitrosamines can be activated by segments of human esophagus and by microsomes of human and rat esophagus and liver. Specimens of 8 human esophagi were removed less than 6 h after death, and segments were incubated for 6 h with 23 and 300 microM N-nitrosomethyl-n-amylamine (NMAA). Hydroxy-NMAA yields were determined by gas chromatography-thermal energy analysis and were insignificant except for those of 5-hydroxy-NMAA, which were low. Microsomes were prepared from 4 batches of human esophagi and samples with 0.6 mg protein were incubated for 20 min with NMAA and cytochrome P-450 cofactors. We determined hydroxy-NMAAs as before and aldehydes by high-performance liquid chromatography of their 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. Incubation of these microsomes with 12 mM NMAA yielded mean values of 0.64 nmol formaldehyde (\"demethylation\"), 0.21 nmol pentaldehyde (\"depentylation\"), and 0.56 nmol total hydroxy-NMAAs/min/mg protein. Metabolite yields under various conditions were determined, including a demonstration that carbon monoxide inhibited 81% of NMAA demethylation, indicating that cytochrome P-450 enzymes were involved. We also examined N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylation by the same microsomes. Rat esophageal microsomes dealkylated NMAA and NDMA similarly to human esophageal microsomes, but with 2-6 times and twice the activity, respectively. Human and rat esophageal microsomes demethylated 6 mM NMAA 18-20 times as rapidly as they demethylated 5 mM NDMA, in contrast to liver microsomes of these species, which demethylated 6 mM NMAA only 0.9-1.4 times as rapidly as they demethylated 5 mM NDMA. However, liver microsomes of both species were more active than esophageal microsomes for NMAA depentylation. The occurrence of NMAA demethylation and (to a lesser extent) depentylation with both human and rat esophageal microsomes is important because these are the activating reactions, and suggests that both human and rat esophagus contain P-450 isozymes that specifically dealkylate asymmetric dialkylnitrosamines. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cells were cultured for 2 days with FSH and delta 4-androstenedione in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of cholinergic agonists. Although ineffective as stimulators of steroidogenesis by themselves, the three nicotinic receptor-selective agonists lobeline, dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP), and phenyltrimethylammonium iodide (PTMA) inhibited FSH-induced progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one production in dose-dependent fashions. The rank order of inhibitory potencies was lobeline greater than DMPP greater than PTMA with IC50 values of 2 X 10(-6) M, 3 X 10(-5) M, and 3 X 10(-4) M, respectively. In contrast, the muscarinic receptor-selective agonists muscarine and bethanechol failed to inhibit steroid production. The inhibitory effect of lobeline on the time course of FSH-induced induced steroid production indicated an immediate inhibitory action; however, this inhibition was readily reversed upon removal of the drug. Further studies demonstrated that the FSH-stimulated increase in intracellular cAMP levels, as well as progesterone production induced by cholera toxin and forskolin (agents that stimulate cAMP production) and by dibutyryl cAMP (a cAMP analog), were also suppressed by lobeline. The present observations indicate that nicotinic, but not muscarinic, cholinergic agonists inhibit progesterone biosynthesis in cultured granulosa cells and suggest that endogenous acetylcholine may play a modulatory role in ovarian steroidogenesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Eighty-two lactating Holstein cows in their first, second, or third lactation were assigned to the study. Cows received .6, 1.8, or 3.0 g of bST in one, three, or five intramuscular injections of a unit dose (.6 g) every 2 wk. Controls received five injections of the vehicle (equivalent volume to the 3.0-g treatment) every 2 wk. Injections were administered from 60 +/- 3 d postpartum until dry-off or necropsy. Thirty-eight animals were continued on treatment for a second consecutive lactation. During the 1st yr of treatment, bST increased mean 3.5% FCM by 7.2, 9.4, and 8.4 kg/d over control production (21.1 kg/d). During the 2nd yr, milk response to .6, 1.8, and 3.0 g of bST averaged 10.6, 3.6, and 4.9 kg/d over controls (24.8 kg/d). The incidence of clinical mastitis increased in the 3.0-g group relative to controls during the 2nd yr. Thus, salable FCM averaged 8.1, 9.1, and 6.2 kg/d above controls (yr 1) and 12.1, 4.7, and -2.8 kg/d (yr 2) for the .6-, 1.8-, and 3.0-g groups. Salable FCM was unaffected by mastitis at a proposed commercial dose (.6 g). Milk fat, protein, lactose, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium, and ash concentrations were unaffected by bST treatment. Calculated energy, calcium, phosphorus, and protein balances also were unaffected except for early decreases of up to 5 Mcal/d, and 40, 20, and 600 g/d, respectively, until feed intake increased. Milk serum bST concentrations greater than the assay limit of sensitivity (1 ng/ml) were routinely measurable only at doses of 1.8 and 3.0 g. Results confirmed that bST concentrations in milk serum are exceedingly small. Overall, supraphysiological doses of sometribove increased milk production with little effect on composition. No toxic effects of bST were observed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

G., and Coggins, J. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10929-10934). Although both sites are carboxymethylated to the same degree in the inactivated enzyme, the modification of Met-205 may be reversed by treatment with mercaptoethanol at alkaline pH, as shown by the stoichiometric loss of label from this site. This, in turn, leads to partial reactivation of the inactive enzyme. Alkylation of Met-23 is not reversible under these conditions. The chemistry of the cleavage reaction at Met-205 was investigated by isolating the cleavage product which was identified by mass spectrometry as the ammonium salt of 2-hydroxyethyl thioacetate. This result is consistent with nucleophilic attack by the thiolate anion of mercaptoethanol on the alpha-carbon of the carboxymethyl moiety, which restores the side chain of the methionine residue (Met-205) and liberates 2-hydroxyethyl thioacetate. The differential reactivity of the 2 carboxymethylated methionine residues toward mercaptoethanol is likely to be a reflection of their different microenvironments in the folded protein. This assertion is borne out by unfolding experiments which indicate that neither of the carboxymethylated methionine residues in dicarboxymethylated dehydroquinase is susceptible to mercaptoethanol cleavage if the protein is first denatured by either guanidine hydrochloride or urea. Furthermore, this denatured material refolds after removal of denaturant to yield protein with reactivation properties similar to untreated, dicarboxymethylated enzyme. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fifteen patients who had been established on IVN were allocated at random to receive either BSHGH (0.1 mg/kg/day) or placebo daily for 7 days. All patients received the same feeding regimen which contaminated 14 gN, 1000 kcal of glucose and 1000 kcal of fat (Intralipid) daily. The mean nitrogen balance for days 4 to 7 was significantly more positive with BSHGH (7.0 +/- 0.6 gN/day) than with placebo (4.4 +/- 0.7 gN/day). The BSHGH group were lighter (53 +/- 4.6 kg body weight) than controls (68 +/- 5.1 kg), but the difference was not significant. Resting energy expenditure (expressed as percentage of day 1) increased throughout the study in patients receiving BSHGH (day 7, 120.8 +/- 5.5%), whereas in patients receiving placebo it remained stable (day 7, 98.9 +/- 2.7%). The nonprotein respiratory quotients were similar for BSHGH (mean days 4-7, 0.94 +/- 0.04) and placebo (mean days 4-7, 0.93 +/- 0.01) (p greater than 0.05). This study demonstrates more positive nitrogen balance, which may in part be due to different substrate loads, and an increase in energy expenditure in patients receiving BSHGH. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the case of the diamagnetic Cu(I) azurin, all 17 nonprotonated aromatic carbons (and Czota of Arg-79) yield narrow resonances. Furthermore, a single-carbon amide carbonyl resonance with an unusual chemical shift (peak chi) is observed. The pH dependence of chemical shifts is used to identify the resonances of Cgamma of titrating histidines, and of Cgamma and Czota of the two tyrosines. The resonances of Cgamma and Cdelta2 of the single tryptophan residue (and Czota of Arg-79) are also identified. The pKa values of the two tyrosines are different from each other and higher than typical values of \"solvent-exposed\" tyrosine residues. Two of the four histidine residues do not titrate (in the pH range 4 to 11). The resonance of Cgamma of one histidine exhibits a pH titration with fast proton exchange behavior and a pKa of 7.5 +/- 0.2. The direction of the titration shift indicates that the imidazole form of this histidine is the Ndelta1-H tautomer. The Cgamma resonance of the other titrating histidine exhibits slow exchange behavior with a pKa of about 7. The imidazole form of this histidine is the Nepsilon2-H tautomer. When going to the paramagnetic Cu(II) protein, only 11 of the 19 carbons mentioned above yield resonances that are narrow enough to be detected. Also, some of the observed resonances exhibit significant paramagnetic broadening. A comparison of spectra of fully reduced azurin, mixtures of reduced and oxidized azurin, and fully oxidized azurin yields the following information. (i) Peak chi arises from an amide group that probably is coordinated to the copper. (ii) The two nontitrating histidine residues are probably copper ligands, with Ndelta1 coordinated to the metal. (iii) The side chains of Arg-79 and the two tyrosine residues are not coordinated to the copper, and Trp-48 is probably not a ligand either. (iv) The gamma carbons of Trp-48, the tyrosine with the lower pKa, the titrating histidine with slow exchange behavior, and three or four of the six phenylalanine residues are sufficiently close to the copper to undergo significant paramagnetic broadening in the spectrum of oxidized azurin. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Experiments were performed with intact, buffer-perfused, isovolumic ferret hearts (n = 9 hypertrophied, n = 9 control) that were loaded with the bioluminescent indicator aequorin to monitor changes in cytoplasmic calcium. In each experiment, left ventricular pressure and intracellular calcium transients were simultaneously recorded. Compared with their age-matched controls, significant hypertrophy of the left ventricle developed 4 weeks after postvalvular aortic banding; at the time the animals were killed, the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was increased in the banded animals (5.3 x 10(-3) versus 3.6 x 10(-3), p less than 0.001). As indicated by the diastolic pressure-volume relation, left ventricular distensibility was significantly diminished in the hypertrophied hearts. In comparison to the controls, the hypertrophied hearts demonstrated a prolonged duration of isovolumic contraction (time to 90% decline from peak: 278 +/- 5.4 versus 247 +/- 10.2 msec, p less than 0.05), but a marked decrease in peak systolic midwall stress (22.4 +/- 5.0 versus 38.6 +/- 5.7 g/cm2, p less than 0.05). The increased duration of isovolumic contraction correlated with a similar prolongation of the calcium transient (time to 90% decline from peak: 245 +/- 19.5 versus 127 +/- 13.2 msec, p less than 0.05), indicating that the rate of sequestration and perhaps release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased in hypertrophy.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Five base breed unrelated rams (greater than or equal to 4 yr old), were chosen for this study: 2 good (I and II), 2 bad (III and IV), and an intermediate sire (V). Ram I, which died a few years before the experiment began, was selected on both the low amplitude of its sperm production during a 6-month period of artificial lighting and the very high fertilizing capacity of its sperm in spring. Rams II to V were controlled for 12 (percentage of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa, AM) or 14 (maximum antero-posterior scrotal diameter of both testes, DT) consecutive months. Following this period of control, seasonal variation in rams was assessed as follows: low (ram II), high (rams III and IV) and intermediate (ram V) seasonal variation rams. Breeding (artificial insemination) of these 5 rams to IF ewes resulted in 18 male offspring born in February and distributed as follows: rams I to III: 4 male offspring/ram (families 1 to 3, F1 to F3), rams IV and V: 3 male offspring/ram (families 4 and 5, F4 and F5). The 18 animals were controlled once a week (DT and AM) from 8, 5 to 46 months of age (7 periods, P1 to P7). Regarding DT, mean DT was higher in F1 and F2 than those of the whole population (WP) (represented by a discontinuous line of ordinate 5.0 in Graph 3), but F2 was closer to this population than F1. On the other hand, they were lower in the rams of F3 and F4. Differences between F3 or F4 and WP were lower in autumn than in spring. All families showed significant differences during the experimental periods except at P7 for pairs 3-5 and 4-5. Distances between F1, F2, F3 were always different (P less than 0.01 or P less than 0.001), whatever the size of the population (n = 3 or 4). Weekly F5 values varied in an opposite way to those of F3 and F4: increase in spring and decrease in autumn. Regarding AM, families did not differ as much as in DT (graph 4). Weekly variations in AM were also stronger. However, mean AM was almost always lower in F1 males and somewhat higher in F3 males to that of WP.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Forty-four cases with uterine cervical cancer and 40 cases with ovarian cancer were enrolled. A daily dose of 800-1,200 mg was administered orally for more than 8 weeks. In 34 evaluable cases with uterine cervical cancer, the overall efficacy rate was 20.6%: CR was shown in 2 cases, PR in 5 cases, MR in 2 cases, NC in 17 cases and PD in 8 cases. Histologically, the response rate was 27.3% in large cell non-keratinizing type, 20.0% in small cell non-keratinizing type and 15.4% in keratinizing type of squamous cell carcinoma. The overall response rate was 20.7% in squamous cell carcinoma, while 25.0% in adenocarcinoma. In 31 evaluable cases with ovarian cancer, the overall efficacy rate was 16.1%: PR was shown in 5 cases, MR in 3 cases, NC in 11 cases and PD in 12 cases. Histologically, the response rate was 16.7% in serous cystadenocarcinoma, 25.0% in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and 33.3% in undifferentiated carcinoma. No responses were observed in cases with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mature cystic teratoma with malignant transformation and mesodermal mixed tumor. Some adverse effects were observed in 43.2% (32 out of 74 cases evaluated for adverse effects), but those of grade 4 were not observed. Most of them were gastro-intestinal disturbances such as diarrhea and anorexia. Diarrhea of grade 3 was observed in 12.2% and anorexia of grade 3 in 5.4%. Severe myelosuppression or hepatic toxicity was not observed.

At [K+]o up to 40 mM, spontaneous action potentials were present, while higher [K+]o gave sustained contractures at a stable membrane potential (-24 to -12 mV for [K+]o from 60 to 120 mM). Tension decreased successively with increasing [K+]o from 30 to 120 mM. The relaxing potency of the dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist, felodipine, increased as the membrane was depolarized with increasing [K+]o and action potentials ceased. These results are compatible with the existence of Ca2+ channels showing voltage-dependent affinity with dihydrophyridines. Increasing [Ca2+]o from 2.5 to 10 mM caused membrane hyperpolarization by about 11 mV and was accompanied by a lower frequency of spontaneous contractions and a longer duration of the relaxation between contractions. 86Rb+ efflux measurements in 60 mM K+ in the absence and presence of felodipine revealed a Ca2(+)-dependent component of the voltage-activated efflux. In normal solution (5.9 mM K+), efflux in the presence of felodipine was similar to the minimal value during normal spontaneous activity. The results indicate regulation of the permeability of K+ channels by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and suggest participation of such channels in the generation of the regularly occurring bursts of action potentials characteristic of spontaneous activity in the mesotubarium. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although the low response rate for the 1987-88 NFCS has raised concerns about possible bias, it is appropriate to use this extensive data set for analyses that do not attempt to generalize the results to the US population as a whole. Two aspects of quality were calculated for the mean of the 3-day reported intakes: number of nutrients below two thirds of the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (low-intake nutrients) and percent of energy from fat. Few adults reported mean intakes that met suggested guidelines: 22% of diets were above two thirds of the RDA for all 15 nutrients and 14% were below 30% fat, but only 2% met both criteria. Energy intake was a strong negative predictor of number of low-intake nutrients and a weak positive predictor of percent of energy from fat. Results of multivariate regression analyses identified few demographic or economic predictors of either the number of low-intake nutrients or percent of energy from fat. According to these data, diets of most adults do not conform to current dietary guidelines. Nutrition education efforts should be directed to all adults, and research should be undertaken to determine more effective ways to help adults improve their overall dietary quality. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After either prolonged (6-18 days) s.c. infusion via osmotic minipumps or repeated i.p. injections of different antidepressants, or a series of electroshocks, treatment was halted and 72 hr later the animals were sacrificed, the brain was dissected and frozen. All major antidepressants (desipramine, amitryptyline or maprotiline), several newer compounds with reported antidepressant activity (viloxazine, zimelidine, fluoxetine, citalopram, progabide, fengabine, sodium valproate, mianserin, trazodone or nomifensine) as well as pargyline and repeated electroshocks, up-regulated GABA B binding in the rat frontal cortex but not hippocampus. This appeared to be a maximum binding effect, but in some instance the kinetics were more complex. Reserpine, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital down-regulated GABA B binding in the frontal cortex, whereas this was unaltered by haloperidol, chlorpromazine or diazepam administration. Desipramine up-regulated GABA B binding in a dose- and time-dependent manner (minimum effective dose, 1.25 mg/kg/day s.c. for 18 days; onset of action, 6 days at 5 mg/kg/day s.c.).

The immunohistochemical reactions of the cells at the lower part of the crypt were essential for the distinction of the four segments.

After transfection into different rodent and human cells, the 862-base-pair (bp) PvuII fragment carrying both c-myc promoters and 350 bp of the untranslated leader conferred 1/15 to 1/30 of the CAT activity mediated by the simian virus 40 promoter. The presence of additional sequences upstream of the PvuII fragment had an overall negative effect on c-myc promoter activity detectable by titration analysis with small amounts of transfected plasmid DNA. The analysis of numerous deletion constructs in the c-myc promoter-leader region as well as S1 mapping experiments demonstrated that the high CAT activity depended largely on the presence of the second promoter. By cotransfection of c-myc-cat constructs with plasmids carrying different parts of the c-myc promoter locus, targets for positively acting cellular factors were identified. Two positive regulatory elements were mapped within the 862-bp PvuII fragment. One was localized within the 248-bp PvuII-SmaI fragment -101 to -349 bp upstream of the first cap site and the other within the 142-pb XhoI-NaeI fragment of the first exon, comprising positions -95 to +47 relative to the second cap site.

The animals were killed at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of age. The morphology of the hippocampus was normal in all irradiated groups with the characteristic interlocking flods of the pyramidal and granular layers. While the number of pyramidal calls of Ammon's horn was unaffected, the number of granule cells of the dentate gyrus was progressively and permanently reduced from control levels by the different dosage schedules (2X, 59% reduction; 4X, 77%; 6X, 83%; 8X, 84%). Incidental observations in control animals indicated a 20% increase in granule cells between 30 and 120 days of age in agreement with earlier observations of granule cell labelling after 3H-thymidine injections in adult rats. The time of origin of tha approximately 15-16% of the granule cells surviving irradiation in the 8X group was determined by injecting either pregnant females (gestation days 19-20) or pups (days 0 and 1) with two successive dosed of 3H-thymidine; the animals were irradiated from day two on the eight X-ray doses. The granule cells surviving in the postnatally injected group were all unlabelled and comparable in number to the unlabelled cells in control animals that were given five successive postnatal injections of 3H-thymidine. This established that the radioresistant complement of granule cells is formed prenatally. In the prenatally injected group, over half the surviving cells were labelled; it was assumed that those not labelled were formed befor gestation day 19. In contrast to the permanent reduction in the number of granule cells, there was some reestablishment of the number of cells in the dentate molecular layer and the Ammonic stratum oriens; in the fimbria, recovery in cell number was complete by 60 days. In a supplementary autoradiographic experiment, cell proliferation in the granular layer and in the fimbria was determined at 60 days of age after a single postnatal injection of 3H-thymidine on either day 15 or day 20 in the control, 2X, 4X and 6X groups.

This implied that tryptophan should be rate-limiting for protein synthesis and this was found in the short term when concentrations of the amino acid were reduced in rats. Multicompartmental studies of tryptophan and tyrosine in controls and patients subject to unipolar depression defined two main pools of the amino acid provisionally assigned to extracellular and intracellular spaces. For tyrosine, mean values for the extracellular space were comparable to those of controls. The concentration of tyrosine was low in the intracellular space in both depressed and recovered patients, but the raised fractional clearance rates for this compartment during depression had returned to normal on remission. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were significantly reduced in depression with intermediate values after recovery. This suggested that the procedure used may have been mildly stressful and that this had evoked an idiosyncratic response to the stress in the depressed patients, which was characterized by inability to maintain concentrations of this amino acid in plasma. The findings for both amino acids may have a bearing on the aetiology of unipolar affective disorder. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The immunodiffusion method was compared with Laser nephelometry for the analysis of IgG, IgM, IgA and C3 in cryoglobulins. Although the two methods of assessment showed a very significant agreement. Laser nephelometry was more sensitive than the double diffusion precipitation method and was used for quantitative analysis of cryoglobulins. The prevalence of any type of cryoglobulins was 64% in ROU and 75% in BS, as compared with controls (15%). In ROU significant levels of IgA were found in minor (P = 0.0196) and major (P = 0.0114) aphthous ulcers and to a lesser extent in herpetiform ulcers (P = 0.0624). Among the four types of BS signficant increases in C3 were found in the arthritic type (P = 0.0068) and ocular type (P = 0.0275), whereas IgM (P = 0.0031) and IgG (P = 0.0369) were increased only in the muco-cutaneous type. Sequential studies showed that disease remissions or exacerbations were correlated with a decrease or increase in IgM or IgG classes of cryoglobulins. However, the converse was found with IgA which may inhibit some functions of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and this may be responsible for the failure to remove damaging IgG, IgM and C3 complexes from the circulation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

(1977), Biochemistry 16 (preceding paper in this issue)). The equations relate experimentally determined concentrations of the reactants, product, and macroscopic intermediates to the probability of occurrence of any of 12 distinct microscopic states. The concentrations of the macroscopic species--light chains (L), heavy chains (H), covalently associated intermediates HL, H2, H2L, and product H2L2--are also explicitly related to an observable function of those concentrations, the sulfhydryl titer, r. Since values of r can be calculated for any microscopic state of the system, the theory is in principle capable of a complete description of the experimental reaction course. In practice, limited experimental information precludes a unique solution of the equations at present, and it was not judged worthwhile to attempt curve fitting or approximation of probability terms with adjustable parameters of unknown physical significance. Certain special cases of the theory are, however, readily and exactly solved. These include models in which reoxidation is a random process and others in which the probabilities for inter-HL and inter-HH bond formation are different but independent of one another. The experimental results in the case of the IgGlkappa studied here clearly depart form the predicted behavior in either of these models. The initial probability for formation of a bond between a heavy and light chain is 1.5 to 2 times greater than for a bond between heavy chains. From the fact that this ratio changes as the reaction proceeds, and from the pattern of variation in concentration of intermediates during the reaction, it is concluded that the reoxidation process is not random, and that the bonds do not form independently, exhibiting instead kinetic cooperativity. The results are discussed in terms of assembly pathways in this and related systems. A novel feature of the theory is that it eliminates time as an explicit variable in the treatment of the kinetic process. This makes it especially useful for discerning whether the formation of one bond influences the reaction probability of another in a system where several similar or intrinsically identical reactions occur, and where kinetic order is difficult to establish. While the theory here is formulated in terms of the reoxidation reactions, it is, for example, equally applicable to the reduction process described (Sears, D.W., et al. (1977b), Biochemistry 16 (following paper in this issue)). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Explants of mammary tissue from pseudopregnant rabbits were cultured at 37 degrees C in air for 24-48h in Medium 199 buffered with 20mm-Hepes [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulphonic acid]. The medium contained insulin and corticosterone, or insulin, corticosterone and sheep prolactin in the presence or absence of ouabain, an inhibitor of Na(+)/K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase. The responses of explants were assessed histologically, by measuring the tissue concentration of K(+), and by rates of synthesis of RNA, protein and fatty acids. The effect of ouabain on Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in slices of lactating rabbit mammary-gland tissue incubated for 1h at 37 degrees C in Krebs bicarbonate buffer was also studied. 2. Prolactin increased the concentration of K(+) in mammary explants, an effect prevented by ouabain. In slices of lactating tissue, there was a linear relationship between the log dose of ouabain (from 0.1 to 10mum) and increased Na(+) and decreased K(+) concentrations in the tissue. 3. Ouabain at concentrations up to 1mum did not affect the rate of synthesis of RNA, protein or fatty acids by explants cultured with insulin and corticosterone. By contrast, the stimulatory effect of prolactin on protein synthesis was diminished and the induction of medium-chain fatty acid synthesis by prolactin was almost abolished. RNA synthesis was unaffected. Histological examination showed no tissue damage by 1mum-ouabain. 4. Explants cultured in the presence of 2mum-ouabain for 24h retained their ability to respond to prolactin when the ouabain was removed from the culture medium. Between 24 and 48h they showed responses to prolactin of a magnitude similar to those of explants never exposed to ouabain. 5. These results show that a fully functional Na(+)/K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase system is necessary for prolactin to promote secretory activity in rabbit mammary gland. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A pleuro-pulmonary fibrosis was discovered in 1987, following an episode of exudative pleurisy on the right side. The thickened pleura was then surgically removed. In the samples of pleuro-pulmonary fibroid tissue taken during the operation, typical asbestos bodies were demonstrated in optical microscopy. The analysis of possible exposure to asbestos that might not have been referred in the anamnesis revealed that in at least six widely used truck models (of which three were driven by the worker from 1958 to 1984), the presence of an asbestos winding around a manifold found on the bottom or on the side of the engine. In such trucks, the engine is inside the driver's cab, covered by a cowling set on the floor. Asbestos fibers could enter the driver's cab through a little window in the cowling or through outlets in the dashboard, carried by the airflow generated by the big fan at the back of the radiator and by the truck motion itself.

These receptors can be blocked by sulphated polysaccharides such as fucoidan (Huang and Yanagimachi, 1984). The aims of the present investigation were to identify these putative zona receptors using 125I-fucoidan as a probe and examine their mechanism of recognition. Results show that 125I-fucoidan binds to several proteins extracted from guinea-pig spermatozoa with molecular masses of 95, 60, 48, 34, 30 and 18-20 x 10(3) (K) on SDS-PAGE. The 48K, 34K and 30K components represent proacrosin and two forms of acrosin, respectively. 125I-zona pellucida glycoproteins also bound strongly to the 48K, 34K and 30K sperm proteins. The other high and low mass binding proteins were not positively identified but cytochemical experiments with fluoresceinamine-fucoidan and FITC-soybean trypsin inhibitor indicate that they are intraacrosomal. The mechanism of binding of 125I-fucoidan to proacrosin/acrosin (and also the 95K, 60K and 18K-20K components) involves multiple sulphate groups on the polysaccharide in a specific orientation to allow them to interact with basic residues on the protein. It is suggested that guinea-pig spermatozoa retain sufficient proacrosin/acrosin bound to the inner acrosomal membrane after the acrosome reaction to mediate binding to the zona pellucida and that functionally proacrosin is analogous to sea urchin binding. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

We randomly mutated codons 1-4 of human PTH (hPTH) with degenerate oligonucleotides and, after expression in COS cells, screened the mutants for receptor binding and cAMP-stimulating activity using ROS 17/2.8 cells. This survey identified Glu4 and Val2 as important determinants of receptor binding and activation, respectively. Positions 1 and 3 were more tolerant of substitutions indicating that these sites are less vital to hormone function. Activities of synthetic hPTH(1-34) analogs further demonstrated the importance of positions 2 and 4. The binding affinity of [Ala4,Tyr34] hPTH(1-34)NH2 was 100-fold reduced relative to [Tyr34]hPTH(1-34)NH2 (Kd values = 653 +/- 270 and 4 +/- 1 nM, respectively), and [Arg2, Tyr34]hPTH(1-34)NH2 was a weak partial agonist which bound well to the ROS cell receptor (Kd = 31 +/- 10 nM). The Arg2 analog was nearly as potent as PTH(3-34) as an in vitro PTH antagonist in osteoblast derived cells. However, unlike PTH(3-34), [Arg2]PTH was a full agonist in opossum kidney (OK) cells. These observations suggest that the activation domains of the OK and ROS cell PTH receptors are different. Thus, amino-terminal PTH analogs may be useful as probes for distinguishing properties of PTH receptors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

LPL may be important in the metabolic pathways that lead to atherosclerosis, since it is secreted in vitro by both of the predominant cell types of the atherosclerotic plaque, i.e., macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Because of uncertainty concerning the primary cellular source of LPL in atherosclerotic lesions, in situ hybridization assays for LPL mRNA were performed on 12 coronary arteries obtained from six cardiac allograft recipients. Macrophages and smooth muscle cells were identified on adjacent sections with cell-specific antibodies and foam cells were identified morphologically. LPL protein was localized using a polyclonal antibody. LPL mRNA was produced by a proportion of plaque macrophages, particularly macrophage-derived foam cells, but was not detected in association with any intimal or medial smooth muscle cells. These findings were confirmed by combined immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization on the same tissue sections. LPL protein was detected in association with macrophage-derived foam cells, endothelial cells, adventitial adipocytes, and medial smooth muscle cells, and, to a lesser extent, in intimal smooth muscle cells and media underlying well-developed plaque. These results indicate that macrophage-derived foam cells are the primary source of LPL in atherosclerotic plaques and are consistent with a role for LPL in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In rats pretreated with reserpine, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) induced forepaw treading and flat body posture; in the same model, MDL 73005EF and buspirone showed minimal agonist activity and at high doses MDL 73005EF inhibited responses to 8-OH-DPAT. 3. In rats trained to discriminate 8-OH-DPAT from saline in a drug discrimination paradigm, both MDL 73005EF and buspirone generalized dose-dependently and completely to the 8-OH-DPAT cue. 4. To define the anxiolytic potential of MDL 73005EF, it was examined in the elevated plus-maze test and in the water-lick conflict test in comparison with diazepam and buspirone. In both tests MDL 73005EF induced effects similar to those seen following diazepam. Buspirone had similar effects to both MDL 73005EF and diazepam in the water-lick conflict test but opposite effects in the elevated plus-maze. 8-OH-DPAT also had opposite effects in the elevated plus-maze test to MDL 73005EF and diazepam. 5.

These results suggest that an interaction with 5-HTIA receptors is the basis of the anxiolytic-like activity of MDL 73005EF.

The nonlinear (sigmoid) relationship between carotid sinus pressure (CSP) and systemic arterial pressure (SAP) reflects threshold and saturation of the SAP responses to CSP changes. The threshold and saturation pressures (TP and SP) are often determined by gross inspection from the experimental recordings. Objective and accurate determination of TP and SP may be achieved by mathematical analysis. Kent et al. (Cardiology, Vol. 57, pp. 295-310, 1972) provided equations that estimated SP and TP to be +/- 1.317/k from the midrange CSP (k, the slope coefficient of a curve). Tan et al. (Circ. Res., Vol. 65, pp. 63-70, 1989) recently used an equation to calculate TP based on the consideration that it is about 95% of the maximal SAP. In this report, we elaborated new equations for the estimation of SP and TP, which approximate midrange pressure +/- 2/k. The accuracy of these new equations compared to other equations was tested using various sets of simulation data. In addition, experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs with isolated carotid sinus. The open-loop CSP-SAP curves were obtained following various holding pressure (HPs) to demonstrate the phenomenon of baroreflex acute resetting. The effects of using different equations on the values of TP, SP, and delta TP/delta HP (extent of resetting) were analyzed. Both simulation and experimental data revealed that the equations of Kent et al. gave rise to values of TP and SP far different from the realistic values. The values of TP calculated by equation of Tan et al. were dependent on the maximal SAP and the slope of the function curve. The TP and SP (+/- 2/k from the midrange pressure of the sigmoid curve) obtained by our new equations were not significantly affected by the maximal SAP and the curve slope. The mathematical analysis may be particularly useful for comparison among various baroreflex curves with different maximal SAP and/or curve slope. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Our studies revealed that B lymphoblasts induced potent cytotoxic thymus (T)-derived lymphocyte (CTL) activity in VSV-immune splenic T cells depleted of adherent accessory cells. Dose-response curves indicated that B lymphoblasts were approximately 15-20 times more efficient APC than spleen cells for CTL induction against VSV. There was little evidence of reprocessing of viral antigens by the responder population because only CTL activity restricted to the parental haplotype of the B lymphoblast was generated following stimulation of VSV-immune F1 T cells. B lymphoblasts activated VSV-specific memory CTL which expressed the Lyt-1-23+, AsGM1+ phenotype without activating natural killer and/or lymphokine-activated killer cells. The ability of B lymphoblasts to function as efficient APC was not related to enhanced viral replication in these cells because potent VSV-specific proliferative and class I-restricted CTL responses were induced by B lymphoblasts infected with VSV rendered noninfectious by exposure to ultraviolet (uv) light. This indicates that activated B cells can efficiently process and present input virion protein. Purified splenic B cells that were not activated by mitogen stimulation did not function as APC for VSV even at high multiplicities of infection. The failure of B cells to function as APC for VSV was related to inefficient uptake of VSV and their inability to provide accessory cell signals required for T-cell proliferation; both these functions developed following mitogen stimulation. These data suggest that activated B cells may function as a potent APC population for virus independent of the specificity of their immunoglobulin antigen receptor. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty-eight hemophiliacs were followed for up to 9 years after seroconversion. In addition, 13 seropositive patients who elected to receive (high purity) factor VIII concentrate for up to 1.5 years were compared to a contemporaneous concurrent control group of 8 seropositive patients treated with intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate, and then both groups were followed for an additional 1.5 years while receiving zidovudine. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 9 of 28 patients (33%) from 1 to 9 years following seroconversion. CD4 cell count declined at a rate of 13.5% per year for the cohort but for persons 25 years and above the rate was significantly higher (17.5 +/- 9.2% per year vs. 9.5 +/- 4.7%, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.05) than in those under 25. All three patients who had undergone splenectomy developed AIDS. Subjects treated with high purity concentrates, with the exception of one patient who developed the nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis, had stable CD4 cell counts.

Full activity, in a transient expression assay, was contained within a region of 550 bp (minimal enhancer). T cells which express CD2 could use the enhancer to activate transcription from the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in the context of a heterologous promoter. Lower levels of transcription were detected in non-CD2-expressing T cells and in B cells. In contrast, the enhancer did not function in the epithelial cell line HeLa or in Colo 320 HSR, a cell line of neuroendocrine origin. Low levels of enhancement were detectable from two core regions, which acted synergistically with other cis-acting sequences to generate the complete enhancer. DNase I footprinting studies identified six cis-acting sequences to which proteins bound. Five of these sequence motifs were novel; the sixth was a canonical cAMP response element. Topoisomerase II, and scaffold attachment region consensus sequences were also found within an A/T-rich area downstream of the minimal enhancer. Neither region was bound to the nuclear matrix. The CD2 enhancer is modular in structure, it is constructed of novel cis-acting sequences and it is a major component of the regulatory system that controls expression of the CD2 gene. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Since thromboembolism is often undiagnosed, both clinically and at routine autopsy, most epidemiologic analyses rest or a very uncertain factual base. There are increases in blood coagulation factors in oral contraceptive users similar to, but less than, those seen in pregnancy, which is not associated with increased thromboembolism. Hematologists emphasize that these changes do not define a \"hypercoagulable\" state, and they do not define or predict the occurrence of thrombosis. Intrinsic vascular wall changes, unrelated to drug use, may play a role in sporadic cases of thromboembolism. When the incidence of thromboembolism in very large Phase III trials of conventional oral contraceptives is compared to that in other populations (patients admitted to the hospital, women who visit a physician, pregnant women, or users of nonestrogenic oral contraceptives), no difference is seen. Epidemiologic studies by the \"case-control\" (\"trohoc\") method consistently show an increase \"relative risk\" associated with oral contraceptive use in subjects with \"idiopathic\" thromboembolism but no increased risk in thromboembolism patients as a whole or in those with predisposing factors. This retrospective epidemiologic technique, its particular applications, and the inferences drawn are open to serious criticism, as are studies claiming a relationship between estrogen dose and thromboembolism incidence. An Australian prospective survey found no increased risk among users, and a large British study which initially reported an increased risk is currently undergoing recalculation. The only controlled clinical experiment (with random assignment of subjects to vaginal versus high-estrogen contraceptives) showed no increased incidence in the drug-treated group. Statistical associations derived from \"trohoc\" studies do not establish causal relationships; moreover, their risk estimates are in conflict with the findings of large Phase III clinical surveys including subjects using estrogen-free contraceptives, with at least one prospective clinical survey, and with a randomized, controlled clinical trial. The data relating estrogen dosage to thromboembolism incidence are ambiguous, at best. Thus, the claim of a causal relationship between oral contraceptive steroids and thromboembolism does not appear to be firmly founded, and the belief that predisposing factors increase the risk to contraceptive users is equally insubstantial. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To determine whether this results from tubular or glomerular mechanisms, late proximal, early distal, and late distal micropuncture were performed in salt resistant (R), salt sensitive (S), or salt sensitive rats with renal perfusion reduced to that of R rats (S-AC). Differences in neuro-endocrine background between groups were eliminated by renal denervation and by fixing plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and vasopressin levels by infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was greater (P less than 0.05) and inulin clearance less (P less than 0.05) in S than R rats. Urinary sodium excretion, however, was not different. S-AC had renal perfusion pressures that were similar to R rats and inulin clearance similar to S rats. Urinary NaCl excretion was less (P less than 0.05) than either group. Single nephron inulin clearance, fluid, and chloride delivery to late proximal sites were not different between groups. Absolute and fractional chloride delivery to early distal sites was less (P less than 0.05) in S-AC than R or S but not different between R and S. Late distal chloride delivery was not different between any group. Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in S-AC than R or S. Thus, the lower urinary NaCl excretion in S-AC rats is in part due to increased loop chloride reabsorption. This effect is probably intrinsic to the S kidney as it occurs despite renal denervation when plasma levels of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone are fixed. The increased loop chloride uptake is abolished when perfusion pressure increases. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

But the blood glucose concentrations increased within all age group in the immediate postoperative phase. The potassium concentrations in the urine decreased throughout in age group I. From these results, one can conclude, that these specific infusion solutions for paediatric surgical procedures with exception of solution I contained the most important electrolytes adaequately and that the amounts of fluids, which were given can be considered as sufficient.

Charybdotoxin (CTX), a blocker of certain types of gKca channels, induced a twofold increase of transmitter release. Similar results were obtained with purified natural toxin, synthetic toxin, and recombinant toxin. Apamin, a blocker of a different type of gKca channel, did not alter transmitter release. CTX was ineffective after intraterminal Ca2+ buffering was increased by application of the membrane-permeant Ca2+ buffer dimethyl-BAPTA-AM. By itself, the permeant buffer first caused a slight increase in transmitter release before release was eventually decreased. This increase of release did not occur when the buffer was applied in the presence of CTX or Ba2+, another gKca channel blocker. Stimulus-evoked entry of Ca2+ in nerve terminals, detected with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator FLUO-3, was increased after blockade of gKca channels by CTX. CTX had no effect on the amount or the time course of synaptic depression. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CTX-sensitive gKca channels normally narrow the presynaptic action potential and thus, by indirectly regulating Ca2+ entry, can serve as powerful modulators of evoked transmitter release. In order to affect presynaptic action potentials, the gKca channels must be located close to Ca2+ channels. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In Japan it has long been common knowledge that the ingestion of green tea should be avoided before and after the intake of iron preparations. There have recently been some reports, however, that deny the effect of green tea on iron preparations. A study was conducted on pregnant patients with anemia, using sodium ferrous citrate (Ferromia). The drug was administered to a group of patients taking green tea and a group taking water. Our results can be summarized as follows. 1. Hemoglobin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity were markedly improved after the administration of the iron preparation, and there was no difference between these parameters in the two groups of patients. 2. There was a tendency for patients with hypochromia to show a more marked improvement in hemoglobin in both groups. 3. Anemia cured in 96.7% of patients in the green tea group and in 93.4% of patients in the water group after the oral administration of the iron preparation. 4. The incidence of side effects stood at 18.3% for the green tea group and 21.9% for the water group, there being no significant difference. No serious side effects were elicited in the present study. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In humans, several allelic human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations also have been recognized. In addition to allelic associations, atypical HLA segregation patterns have been observed in leukemic families. These include a higher frequency of HLA-identical unaffected siblings, increased HLA homozygosity and increased maternal HLA-DR identity. These observations suggest preferential transmission of disease-associated haplotypes and a male transmission bias in leukemic families. The lack of disease-specific segregation, however, supports the idea that the HLA system is not directly relevant in leukemogenesis. Therefore, the existence of another genetic region linked to the MHC, causing segregation distortion, and containing recessive leukemia susceptibility genes may be postulated. The mouse t-complex would fit this model. This gene complex has recessive (semi-) lethal genes, is transmitted preferentially through fathers, and both the mouse t-complex and its rat homolog, growth and reproduction complex grc, confer susceptibility to carcinogenesis. This model could also explain the increased spontaneous abortion rate in mothers of leukemic patients, epidemiologic associations of leukemia with oral clefts and neuroectodermal tumors, and the transmission of a radiation-induced leukemia risk through fathers. Such segregation distortion might be the reason behind the maintenance of a gene(s) with a lethal effect in the population. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To investigate how endothelium regulates cGMP production in vascular smooth muscle, bovine aortic endothelial cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured both separately and together in cocultures for 48 hr. Nitroprusside (1 mM) increased intracellular cGMP concentration 30-fold in smooth muscle cells (from a basal level of 103 +/- 54 fmol/mg of cell protein to 2920 +/- 1800 fmol/mg) but only 2-fold in endothelial cells (from 41 +/- 7 fmol/mg to 93 +/- 23 fmol/mg). When endothelial and smooth muscle cells were cocultured as a mixed cell population (1:1 cell ratio), both basal and nitroprusside-stimulated cGMP levels were significantly increased (550 +/- 250 and 13,240 +/- 9950 fmol/mg of total cell protein, respectively). The calcium ionophore A23187 (10 microM) caused no increase in cGMP concentration in either cell type cultured alone but produced a 6-fold increase in cocultures. Neither aspirin nor 5,8,11,14-icosatetraynoic acid influenced these results. No changes in cAMP levels were detected. Using cocultures in which one cell type was grown on microcarrier beads, we have shown that cGMP increased only in vascular smooth muscle cells and was not dependent upon the formation of junctions between endothelium and smooth muscle cells. In long-term (48-hr) mixed-cell cocultures, but not in short-term microcarrier cocultures, amplification of the nitroprusside-induced increase in cGMP was observed. These results show that responses associated with endothelium-dependent relaxation can be reconstituted in cultured endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and that endothelium generates a humoral factor(s) that stimulates accumulation of smooth muscle cGMP and has a longer-term effect that amplifies guanylate cyclase stimulation by nitroprusside, a drug acting directly upon smooth muscle to stimulate formation of the cyclic nucleotide. Cultured cells provide a valuable model system for the study of endothelium-vascular smooth muscle interactions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The first official human dissection in Strasbourg was performed in 1517. The teaching of medicine really began with the establishment of the Academy in 1566, but it was only in 1652 that a specific chair was created for anatomy. The first anatomical theatre was opened in 1670 in a secularized church contiguous to the city hospital. Until 1708, the teaching of anatomy is combined with that of botany; it was only from this date that anatomy was to be associated with surgery, and such was the case until the French Revolution. During the nineteenth century an impressive museum of anatomy was gradually established in Strasbourg. In 1872, after the annexation of Alsace, when the new german university was created, normal and pathological anatomy were separated and each chair attached to a particular institute. The building housing the institutes of normal and pathological anatomy was inaugurated in 1877 and is still used today. In 1919, when the Faculty of medicine was reorganized after Alsace was restored to France, histology and embryology were definitively separated from anatomy. Many famous anatomists worked in Strasbourg, among whom are to be found: J. G. von Andernach (1497-1574), T. Lauth (1758-1826), F. D. Reisseissen (1773-1828), J. F. Lobstein (1777-1835), E. A. Lauth (1803-1837), E. KÃ¼ss (1815-1871), E. KoeberlÃ© (1828-1915), E. Beaunis (1830-1921), H. D. Bouchard (1833-1899), J. G. Joessel (1838-1892), W. Waldeyer (1836-1921), G. Schwalbe (1844-1916), W. Pfitzner (1853-1903), F. Keibel (1861-1929), A. Forster (1878-1957) and Ph. Bellocq (1888-1962). \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The areas containing underlying photoreceptor cells were subsequently investigated by electron microscopy at 60 days and light microscopy immunocytochemistry at 60 and 120 days. Retinal regions containing viable RPE-cell grafts exhibited melanin-contained RPE cell transplants attached to Bruch's membrane and containing shed rod outer segments (ROS). Also, the ROS of these photoreceptor cells exhibited a normal-appearing structural relationship with apical membrane projections of these RPE cells. The debris zone, prominent in retinas of 60 day-old RCS dystrophic rats, was much reduced in RPE-cell grafted regions. By at least 3 months after RPE transplantation, immunostaining for Na+,K+-ATPase was demonstrated along inner segments (IS) of photoreceptor cells in grafted regions, as was also shown in control retinas, but not in non-grafted regions. Opsin immunostaining in RPE-cell grafted regions and in control retinas was detected along ROS and rod inner segments (RIS) and at the periphery of cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer. This study has shown that transplanted normal RPE cells in retinas of RCS dystrophic rats appear to have normal functional and structural characteristics at least three months after transplantation. Furthermore, the rescued PRC's exhibited a normal distribution of and immunostaining density for the membrane-bound enzyme Na+,K+-ATPase and the photo-pigment opsin. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The probands had typical symptoms of severe isolated GH deficiency complicated by antibody development and growth arrest after human (h) GH treatment. DNA analysis using the restriction endonucleases Eco RI, Bam HI, and Hind III revealed that the restriction fragment containing the hGH-N gene was absent along with those bearing the human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS)-A and -B and hGH-V sequences. A total of about 40 kilobases DNA were absent due to two separate deletions flanking the hCS-L gene. The two affected siblings are homozygous for this rearrangement of the hGH/hCS gene cluster, which could have been generated by homologous crossing over between two different chromosomes, one bearing one of the previously described deletions of the hGH-N gene, and one bearing a deletion of DNA containing the hCS-A, hCS-B, and hGH-V sequences. Alternatively, this abnormality could have been generated by a complex intrachromosomal rearrangement. The parents, who are consanguinous, have DNA restriction patterns consistent with heterozygosity for this double deletion. This type of deletional mutation is the first involving multiple deletion of the hGH and hCS gene cluster. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Perfusion pressure was decreased by partial inflation of a brachiocephalic artery occluder and increased by an intravenous angiotensin II infusion. Cerebral flood flow was measured with radiolabeled microspheres. On average, 45% +/- 3% (SEM) reductions in perfusion pressure were accompanied by 49% +/- 4% decreases in cerebral blood flow. Increases in perfusion pressure of 42% +/- 3% were associated with 45% +/- 7% increments in cerebral flood flow. The cerebral oxygen consumption was not significantly altered in either case. We also investigated the effect of pentobarbital on fetal cerebral oxygen consumption and cerebral blood flow at normal and at altered perfusion pressure. At normal perfusion pressure pentobarbital caused a 27% +/- 5% decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption that was associated with a 44% +/- 4% decrement in cerebral blood flow and a slight widening of the arteriovenous oxygen content gradient. In this hypometabolic cerebral state, alterations in perfusion pressure were again accompanied by proportional changes in cerebral blood flow. Both perfusion pressure and the cerebral oxygen consumption appear to be important determinants of fetal cerebral blood flow. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, a syndrome in which the concentration of LDL cholesterol in plasma is abnormally low, can be caused by mutations in the apo B gene that prevent the translation of a full-length apo B-100 molecule. Prior studies have revealed that truncated species of apo B [e.g., apo B-37 (1728 amino acids), apo B-46 (2057 amino acids)] can occasionally be identified in the plasma of subjects with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia; in each of these cases, the truncated apo B species has been a prominent protein component of VLDL. In this report, we describe a kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia in which the plasma of four affected heterozygotes contained a unique truncated apo B species, apo B-31. Apolipoprotein B-31 is caused by the deletion of a single nucleotide in the apo B gene, and it is predicted to contain 1425 amino acids. Apolipoprotein B-31 is the shortest of the mutant apo B species to be identified in the plasma of a subject with hypobetalipoproteinemia. In contrast to longer truncated apo B species, apo B-31 was undetectable in the VLDL and the LDL; however, it was present in the HDL fraction and the lipoprotein-deficient fraction of plasma. The density distribution of apo B-31 in the plasma suggests the possibility that the amino-terminal 1425 amino acids of apo B-100 are sufficient to permit the formation and secretion of small, dense lipoproteins but are inadequate to support the formation of the more lipid-rich VLDL and LDL particles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The clinical course and outcome of 31 patients who had osteosarcoma metastatic to the lungs diagnosed between 1962 and 1990 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital were reviewed to determine whether the use of increasingly aggressive multimodality therapy has improved their outcome. The patients were grouped by treatment eras, based on major changes in therapy (i.e., single-agent or two-agent era, 1962-1972; standard multiagent era, 1972-1982; and intensive multiagent era, 1982-1990). With increasingly intensive chemotherapy, more aggressive efforts to resect metastatic disease, and earlier detection of pulmonary metastases by computed tomography, the survival of these patients has improved significantly over the 28-year study period. Those treated since 1982 have a 50% estimated probability of survival at 3 years, whereas there were no survivors at 3 years in the two earlier eras. Survival for the former group reached a plateau of 30% at 4 years. The use of aggressive multimodality therapy, coupled with modern pediatric imaging techniques to detect pulmonary disease, has improved the traditionally dismal outlook in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma and synchronous pulmonary metastases. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In this report it is shown that BA can activate human CD3+ T cells to secrete interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). Unlike mitogens, such as phytohemagglutinin, this stimulation was associated with minimal T-cell proliferation or upregulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. Monocytes inhibited BA-mediated IFN gamma secretion since their removal resulted in increased responses, whereas adding monocytes back to cultures caused inhibition. BA elicited IFN gamma from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, although CD4+ T cells secrete significantly more (p less than 0.05) IFN gamma than CD8+ T cells. The ability of BA to elicit IFN gamma from human T cells was inhibited in the presence of anti-Tac, suggesting that BA also induces IL-2 secretion and that IL-2 is involved in BA-mediated IFN gamma secretion. Detectable IL-2 secretion was induced by BA in the presence of anti-Tac. Exogenous IL-2 acted synergistically with BA to enhance IFN gamma secretion, suggesting that the amount of IL-2 released by BA alone was insufficient for optimal IFN gamma release. Furthermore, addition of IL-2 to T cells from individuals with poor or absent responses to BA, including individuals infected with HIV-1, restored their ability to secrete IFN gamma in response to BA. These data indicate that BA is capable not only of activating human B cells but can also induce T cells, probably of the TH1 phenotype, to secrete IFN gamma.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has been found in cases with ischemia, anoxia or hypoglycemia and in more than half of the epileptic brains examined at autopsy. Various theories about its pathogenesis have been propounded. Among them, the \"Pathoklise\" theory of the Vogts and the vascular theory of Spielmeyer and his associates were prevailing until recently. In 1953, two articles were published to contribute to the pathogenesis of ictal automatism (a type of complex partial or temporal lobe seizures). One is the incisural sclerosis theory by Penfield and his associates and the other is the Ammon\\'s horn sclerosis theory by Sano and Malamud. The former authors described a diffuse sclerosis of the infero-mesial temporal structures without, however, specifically relating it to AHS. They considered it was the result of localized anoxia of that portion of the brain caused by incisural herniation occurring during parturition. Sano and Malamud maintained that AHS is a result of convulsions, a distinct scar adjacent to which epileptogenic foci may develop in the course of time to cause ictal automatism. The latter theory was corroborated by Sano, Falconer and others. Falconer expanded the theory to the assertion that not only ictal automatism but other types of intractable epilepsy may be due to \"mesial temporal (Ammon\\'s horn) sclerosis\". The most recent development in the pathogenesis of AHS is the excitotoxicity theory. Namely, AHS is caused by excessive excitation of neurons, probably by putative excitatory neurotransmitters, especially, glutamate. For this theory, there is a significant body of evidence. The problem of AHS, an old research subject and a matter of long-lasting controversy, has now been updated and become one of the newest topics in the field of experimental neurobiology. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

On the contrary, care should be taken not to practice \"Utopian medicine\" in chronic venous insufficiency by prescribing treatment that the patient cannot or does not want to carry out. For this reason, it is not sufficient to prescribe the most logical treatment; a careful examination should be undertaken of the patient\\'s character, requirements, family circle and work, as well as the influence exerted upon him by current social behaviour. Above all, three observations should be made. Some patients undertake cures that are completely different from those prescribed by their phlebologist, since they still have faith in certain outmoded rules. Others put into practice fragments of medical knowledge that have been passed on by popular wisdom.

We have examined 780 occipitofrontal circumferences (OFC), mean and +/- SD, of DS children from birth to age 5 years. Also, gross and microscopic neuropathological studies in the same age group were performed, with special attention to brain weight (BW), shape, myelin formation, cortical organization of 101 DS and 80 non-DS individuals; ultrastructural studies were also performed on selective cases (five DS and five non-DS). The OFC was plotted on Nellhause curves and showed microcranium after mid-infancy in most cases. Twenty percent of DS children had an OFC in the lower normal range. The brain shape in DS newborn infants was the same as in non-DS infants, but after 3-5 months of age in DS infants the antero-posterior diameter was found to be shorter than in non-DS infants. Narrowness of the superior temporal gyrus was noted in 34 of 101 (33%) of DS brains. Microscopic examination showed myelination delay in 22.5% DS and only in 6.8% non-DS children. Morphometric studies in DS cases from birth showed fewer neurons (20-50% less), lower neuronal densities, and neuronal distribution, especially of cortical layers II and IV. Ultrastructurally in DS, the synaptic density, synaptic length, and contact zones were found to be abnormal. The retardation of brain growth, maturation delay, and cortical dysgenesis present in DS children most likely are regulated by the extra chromosome 21, but the gene responsible for the abnormalities remains to be determined. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The lymphomas all express TGF-beta, and some express IL-3 and IL-4. We observed that both the lymphomas and the peritoneal cells produce TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and IL-6. Another cytokine, IL-10, is produced predominantly by peritoneal Ly-1+B cells from healthy mice and by Ly-1+ B lymphomas, but not by conventional B cells. As IL-10 regulates the production of monokines and a subset of T-cell derived cytokines, our results suggest a broad immunoregulatory role for Ly-1 B cells. To complement these studies we have also examined the responses of Ly-1 B cells to mitogens and cytokines previously shown to stimulate conventional B cells. In summary, Ly-1 B cells, in contrast to conventional B cells do not respond to anti-Ig antibodies, even in the presence of IL-4. They do respond to LPS, and this response is preferentially enhanced by IL-5, and marginally enhanced by IL-3. Surprisingly LPS-induced proliferation of peritoneal B cells is inhibited by IL-6 and to a greater extent by IL-10. Whether this inhibition is a result of differentiation into Ig secreting cells is currently being evaluated. We discuss our findings in terms of the potential of Ly-1 B cells to regulate their own development and the immunocompetence of other cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There were no significant differences in prechallenge prostanoid levels between the four groups, with the potentially bronchoprotective mediators present in highest concentration. Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases (p less than 0.05) in PGD2 (97.4 +/- 19.4 to 1,053.2 +/- 338.6 pg/ml, mean +/- SEM) and TX (45.5 +/- 7.5 to 150.7 +/- 37.8 pg/ml) over prechallenge levels and control groups. Similarly, histamine increased in the atopic asthmatics after challenge (0.36 +/- 0.22 to 6.84 +/- 1.86 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). Atopic nonasthmatics had slight increases in PGD2 (96.9 +/- 25.4 to 219.7 +/- 47.5 pg/ml; p greater than 0.1) after challenge, whereas PGD2 and TX did not change in nonatopic subjects. A significant positive correlation was found between histamine, PGD2, and TX levels after challenge among all groups (p less than 0.001).

Hind-limb suspension for 2 weeks was used to produce atrophy in two groups of mice, ages 4 and 12 weeks, with nonsuspended animals serving as controls. Young HS mice exhibited marked decreases in SOL weight, length, cross-sectional area (CSA), twitch and tetanic tensions, and rates of tension development and relaxation, with increases in fatigue resistance. HS reduced the diameter of both type I and IIA fibers, increased the percentage of type I fibers, and decreased the percentage of type IIA fibers in both young and adult SOL. Muscle weight, length, CSA, IIA and IIB fiber areas, and maximum rate of tetanic tension development were decreased in EDL of young HS mice; fatigue resistance and EDL half-relaxation times were increased. For most parameters evaluated, slow twitch muscle was more affected than fast twitch. HS affected contractile characteristics less than morphometric or histologic parameters. Rates of tension development and relaxation were the contractile parameters most affected by HS, and the time parameters of contraction were least affected.

This study sought to elucidate differences between bovine retinal and brain pericytes. When pairs of retinal and brain pericytes from individual calves were cultured in vitro, the morphological organisation of early post-confluent retinal pericyte cultures was consistently different from that of brain pericyte cultures. When retinal and brain pericyte cultures were grown to second passage in high or normal glucose medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, brain pericyte cultures grew significantly faster than retinal pericytes in either medium (p less than 0.0001). Brain pericytes thus appeared to grow intrinsically faster than retinal pericytes and this effect was largely independent of glucose concentration. Brain pericytes also grew faster than retinal pericytes in high glucose medium containing human diabetic or control serum (p less than 0.002). The proliferative effect of serum from diabetic patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy on pericytes grown in high glucose medium was not significantly different from that of control serum. Both brain and retinal pericytes showed variation in their ability to replicate in high concentrations of glucose. The selectivity of pericyte degeneration to the retinal circulation does not appear to be due to changes in the mitogenic activity of diabetic serum for retinal pericytes, but may relate to the intrinsic relative inability of the retinal pericyte to reproliferate in response to the metabolic injury of diabetes mellitus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The enzyme was found to be cold labile and extremely unstable in crude hemolysate, with complete loss of activity occurring after 24 hours at 4 degrees C. However, maintenance of crude hemolysate at 20 to 25 degrees C in the presence of EDTA and KCl increased NAD synthetase stability substantially (half-life = 10 days). Using these conditions, NAD synthetase was purified 3,100-fold with a 29% yield using DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and dialysis. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), adenosine triphosphate, Mg2+, glutamine, and K+ were 0.108, 0.154, 1.36, 2.17, and 8.32 mmol/L, respectively. The pH optimum ranged between 6.8 and 7.4, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 483 +/- 5 Kd. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by Pb2+ and Zn2+, with concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition of activity of 1.3 and 2.0 mumol/L, respectively. The incubation of intact red blood cells with lead followed by rigorous washing to remove lead abolished nearly all NAD synthetase activity. In contrast, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which is not sensitive to lead, was unaffected, whereas pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase activity, which is sensitive to lead, was decreased 30% to 50% under these conditions. More importantly, patients with lead overburden (34 to 72 micrograms Pb2+/dL blood) all had markedly decreased NAD synthetase activity. These data together with other results suggest that erythrocyte NAD synthetase activity is a sensitive indicator of lead exposure in humans. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

We present here the molecular maps of the DQ and DX subregions and analyze the sequences of the polymorphic DQ alpha and DQ beta genes as well as the DX alpha and DX beta genes. The DQ alpha and DQ beta genes are oriented in opposite directions, approximately 12 kilobases apart. The DX alpha and DX beta genes are similarly oriented about 8 kilobases. The exon-intron organizations of the DQ alpha and DX alpha genes are analogous to those of other class II alpha genes. Comparison of the DQ alpha gene sequence to three DQ alpha cDNA clones shows that amino acid replacements are predominantly located between residues 45 and 80 in the amino-terminal domain. Analysis of the frequency of silent and replacement substitutions indicates that there is little selection against replacements in DQ alpha first domains. The exons encoding the second domains of DQ alpha and DX alpha are virtually identical, suggesting that a gene conversion event has occurred between these genes. The DX beta gene is very similar to the DQ beta gene but differs in the cytoplasmic portion. The DX beta gene contains a separate exon of 24 nucleotides encoding the core of the cytoplasmic tail. This exon is not expressed in the DQ beta genes due to a nonfunctional splice junction. Comparison of the number of nucleotide substitutions in the DQ beta first and second domain exons suggests that little or no phenotypic selection acts on the first domain whereas the second domain is under strong selection. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Studies were performed in isolated left colons from New Zealand White rabbits. Oleic acid in concentrations from 0.22 to 22 mM suspended in 10 mM DCA significantly stimulated release of PYY (P less than 0.01) but resulted in no graded response (Bartlett's test, P = 0.15). Similarly, oleic acid (2.2 mM) suspended with ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mM) produced no increased release of PYY above that achieved by ursodeoxycholic acid alone. In contrast, oleic acid (2.2 and 22 mM suspended with 10 mM DCA) produced a graded release of enteroglucagon during the stimulated period. Deoxycholic acid caused a concentration-dependent release of PYY (1, 3.3, 10, and 25 mM) during the stimulated period. Deoxycholic acid (1 and 10 mM) did not significantly increase enteroglucagon release. Tetrodotoxin blockade had no effect on release of PYY stimulated by 10 mM DCA. Because PYY and enteroglucagon are both found in colonic endocrine cells, these results suggest that the release of PYY and enteroglucagon are mediated by specific secretagogues and not simply caused by noxious effects of the agonists. Also, this study has demonstrated that DCA-stimulated release of PYY is not dependent on neuronally mediated mechanisms. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Each agonist induced a rapid development of contraction followed by a sustained response. The maximal rate of force generation stimulated with PGF2 alpha was twice that seen with K+ or histamine. Stimulation with 40 mM K+ increased the extent of monophosphorylated 20 kDa myosin light chain (MLC-P) for up to 1 min to a maximal value of 38.8 +/- 1.0%, there was a subsequent rapid decrease and the MLC-P level remained just above the basal value for 40 min (6.8 +/- 3.0%). In the case of stimulation with 7 microM histamine, MLC-P level increased rapidly and was sustained for up to 40 min (28.0 +/- 4.9%). In contrast to the stimulation with K+ or histamine, PGF2 alpha induced both mono- and diphosphorylated MLC20 (MLC-P and MLC-P2 respectively) at a low concentration (3 microM). The monophosphorylation of MLC20 induced by 30 microM PGF2 alpha reached the maximal value of 32.8 +/- 5.2%, and was sustained for up to 40 min (15.2 +/- 5.4%). The diphosphorylation of MLC20 increased rapidly (7.4 +/- 4.0% at 5 min), then decreased to the basal value within 40 min. These results suggest that different modes of stimulation of smooth muscle contraction produce different profiles of MLC20 phosphorylation. The implications of these observations are that the diphosphorylated form, specifically induced by certain agents, may modify the mode of contraction of the aortic artery. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method. Poly-L-proline-conjugated Sepharose beads were used to assess the relative concentration of actin bound to profilin with high enough affinity to withstand dilution (profilin-actin complex) and DNase I-conjugated beads to measure the relative concentration of actin in the Triton-soluble fraction not bound to profilin. Actin associated with the Triton-insoluble fraction (F-actin) was also measured. In unstimulated PMN, the relative concentration of actin bound to profilin was maximum. After FMLP stimulation, profilin released actin monomers within 10 s, with the profilin-actin complex concentration reaching a nadir by 40 s and remaining low as long as the cells were exposed to chemoattractant (up to 30 min). If FMLP was dissociated from PMN membrane receptors using t-BOC, actin reassociated with profilin within 20 s. Quantitative analysis of these reactions, however, revealed that profilin release of and rebinding to actin could account for only a small percentage of the total change in F-actin content. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. When purified actin was polymerized in PMN Triton extract containing EGTA, removal of profilin from the extract minimally affected (12% reduction) the high apparent critical concentration at which actin began to assemble. Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Serum albumin, fibrinogen and fibronectin inhibited adhesion of neutrophils, so that the spreading, random motility and chemotaxis of these cells could not be assessed in the presence of these proteins alone. These plasma proteins induced little or no polarization of the cells in suspension. Of the remaining preparations, gamma globulin promoted adhesion and excessive spreading and caused corresponding reduction of random motility and chemotaxis to FMLP of these cells. This plasma protein, even in low concentration, induced marked polarization of neutrophils in suspension. Both Cohn fractions III and IV supported adhesion and permitted random motility and chemotaxis to FMLP approximating that which occurs in dilute plasma. These fractions induced moderate polarization of cells in suspension. Addition of serum albumin or fibronection to the preparations of gamma globulin, or Cohn fractions III or IV did not alter the adhesion, random motility or chemotaxis of the neutrophils in these preparations. These results suggest that alpha and beta globulins, as well as gamma globulins are factors in plasma affecting adhesiveness and polarization of neutrophils and which provide for optimal motility and chemotaxis of these cells on solid substrata.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The shortening reaction of the axon involves contractile forces that also arise during normal axonal motility, elongation, and retraction. We studied shortening in axonal segments isolated from their parent axons by transecting the axon between the growth cone and the most distal point of adhesion to the substrate. Within 15-20 minutes after transection, an isolated axonal segment shortened and pulled its tail end toward the growth cone. During the shortening process, long sinusoidal bends arose along the axon. The identical shortening reaction occurs without transection, when the axon tip is detached from the substrate. Pharmacological studies with inhibitors of glycolysis indicate that the shortening mechanisms utilize metabolic energy, presumably ATP. The rate of sinusoidal shortening is similar to both the rate of polymer translocation in the axon by slow axonal transport and the rate of normal axonal elongation. Taxol inhibits the shortening reaction with a similar dose dependence to its inhibition of axonal growth. Together, all these observations suggest that the same basic intracellular motility mechanisms are involved in normal axonal growth, in slow axonal transport, and in the shortening reaction: the intracellular dynamic system that utilizes ATP to generate longitudinal movements of polymers within the axon may be the same mechanism underlying both the retraction and the elongation of the axon. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Most (3038) patients (80.1%) exhibited a base deficit. Base deficit, age, injury mechanism, and head injury were associated with mortality using logistic regression. Age less than 55 years, no head injury, and a base deficit of -15 mmol/L were associated with 25% mortality. Age greater than or equal to 55 years with no head injury or age less than 55 years with a head injury and a base deficit of -8 mmol/L were associated with a 25% mortality. When shock was added to the model, all factors remained significant, and base deficit was supplemental to blood pressure. Base deficit also added significantly to the Revised Trauma Score and TRISS measurements. The base deficit is an expedient and sensitive measure of both the degree and the duration of inadequate perfusion.

The authors studied both primary and secondary breast lymphomas with a broad panel of T- and B-cell markers using paraffin-embedded tissue and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Cases of primary B-cell lymphoma were further tested to determine light and heavy chain type. Thirty-five cases were analyzed, including 16 primary lymphomas. Diffuse large cell lymphoma was present in ten of 16 primary and 14 of 18 secondary cases. Lymphoepithelial lesions in ducts and lobules and frequent vascular involvement were found in both primary and secondary cases. Immunohistochemistry studies on 13 tumors revealed all of the primary tumors to be B-cell in origin, except for one case of primary T-cell lymphoma; to the authors' knowledge, this represents the first description of this entity. Fifteen of 17 secondary tumors exhibited B-cell markers and one of 17 exhibited T-cell markers; in only one case could lineage not be determined. Among primary B-cell cases, IgM was found to be the most frequent heavy chain type; IgA reactivity was found in only one case. Survival was related to stage and histologic characteristics; patients with Stage II disease and higher grade histologic lesions had a worse prognosis. Half of the patients with primary lymphoma have had recurrent disease. Although local recurrences were observed, the authors also saw a tendency for recurrence in other extranodal sites. The authors conclude that, although primary lymphoma of the breast is compatible with long-term survival, a significant number of patients eventually die of their disease. As with other extranodal lymphomas, survival rate appears most related to stage of disease. Also, the vast majority of primary tumors are B-cell in origin, express IgM heavy chain, and can be considered tumors of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The material obtained was of high purity and suitable for direct microsequence analysis. Chromatographic analysis could resolve at least two major beta-polypeptides, beta a and beta b, two major alpha-polypeptides, alpha a and alpha b, and two additional minor polypeptides. N-terminal amino acid sequencing shows that the resolved peaks correspond to different polypeptide species and that the minor species have an N-terminal sequence identical to that of the alpha b polypeptide. An oligonucleotide derived from the amino terminal sequence of the alpha a polypeptide was utilized to screen a genomic library from Rps.palustris. Several independent clones have been characterized by Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analysis. We show that Rps.palustris contains at least four different clusters of beta and alpha genes. Two clones contain sequences potentially coding for beta a-alpha a and beta b-alpha b polypeptides; and two additional clones potentially coding for beta and alpha peptides which we named beta c-alpha c and beta d-alpha d, which did not correspond to the major purified polypeptides.

The effect has been recognized non-acute, unlike that of bronchodilators. However, we have found that some patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) show significant improvement soon after a single inhalation of SCG nebulized solution. In this study, we investigated the acute bronchodilator effect of SCG given by nebulizer in adult asthmatics, especially compairing AIA with non-AIA (aspirin-tolerant asthma) patients. Twenty patients with AIA and 11 with non-AIA participated in the study. After performing spirometry on remission, they inhaled either SCG via a nebulizer or 4 ml of placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. After inhalation, spirometry was performed every ten minutes for one hour. The placebo used was a saline solution of the same osmolarity as that of the SCG nebulized solution. Placebo inhalation provoked asthmatic attacks in five of the patients with AIA and one with non-AIA, but SCG did not. In the AIA group, twelve out of the twenty patients also had improved nasal symptoms soon after inhalation of SCG. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was significantly improved 10 minutes after inhalation of SCG. Fifty minutes after SCG inhalation, the percent degree of FEV1 improvement was approximately 17%. However, FEV1 was significantly decreased by approximately 14% after inhalation of placebo. In the non-AIA group, FEV1 was not increased after inhalation of SCG. V25 was not changed after inhalation of SCG in AIA and non-AIA groups.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Direct repeats define the left and right ends of the T-DNA, but tumorigenesis requires only the right-hand repeat. Virulence (vir) genes act in trans to mobilize the T-DNA into plant cells. Transfer of T-DNA begins when the VirD endonuclease cleaves within the right-hand border repeat. Although the T-DNA right-border repeat promotes T-DNA transmission best in its normal orientation, an inverted right border exhibits reduced but significant activity. Two models may account for this diminished tumorigenesis. The right border may function bidirectionally, with strong activity only in its wild-type orientation, or it may promote T-DNA transfer in a unidirectional manner such that, with an inverted right border, transfer proceeds around the entire Ti plasmid before reaching the T-DNA. To determine whether a substantial portion of the Ti plasmid is transferred to plant cells, as predicted by the unidirectional-transfer hypothesis, we examined T-DNAs in tumors induced by strains containing a Ti plasmid with a right border inverted with respect to the T-DNA oncogenes. These tumors contained extremely long T-DNAs corresponding to most or all of the Ti plasmid. To test whether the right border can function bidirectionally, we inserted T-DNAs with either a properly oriented or an inverted right border into a specific site in the A. tumefaciens chromosome. A border situated to transfer the oncogenes first directed T-DNA transfer even from the bacterial chromosome, whereas a border in the opposite (inverted) orientation did not transfer the oncogenes to plant cells. Our results indicate that the right-border repeat functions in a unidirectional manner. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Hydrochlorothiazide was given throughout successive 4- to 5-week periods of placebo, propranolol, and clonidine administration. During each treatment period, subjects were admitted twice to the clinical research unit for 24-hour blood pressure monitoring performed during administration of placebo, propranolol and clonidine and repeated 1 to 2 weeks later during the first 24 hours after the abrupt cessation of placebo or drug administration. Blood pressure was recorded at 15-minute intervals using an automated noninvasive recorder (Arteriosonde, Roche, New Jersey). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were averaged and the standard deviation taken as the measure of long-term variability (LTV). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sequential overlapping blocks of seven readings were averaged and the standard deviation calculated. Short-term variability (STV) was estimated as the average of the standard deviations of the running means. During placebo administration and withdrawal, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as LTV and STV were unchanged. Systolic and diastolic pressures did not differ during propranolol administration from those during propranolol withdrawal or placebo withdrawal. Systolic and diastolic LTV and STV did not differ during propranolol administration and withdrawal from those observed during placebo administration or withdrawal. After clonidine withdrawal, both systolic and diastolic pressures increased to values significantly greater than during clonidine administration. These values were significantly greater than those observed after placebo withdrawal, thereby indicating rebound hypertension. After clonidine withdrawal, seven of fourteen subjects developed systolic pressure rebound; diastolic pressure rebound was observed in three patients.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The saline eluates were found to contain IgG and IgM with traces of IgA; their pH optima for the uptake by RBC were 6.0 +/- 0.5, 5.5 +/- 0.5 and c 5.0 respectively. The ratio of bound IgG to IgM was linearly related to the uptake pH. Both C4 AH and lysis were found to be optimum at pH 6.0--7.5, whereas the maximum C3 AH was at pH 6.0 +/- 0.5. The LISR performed at a constant pH (6.1 +/- 0.1) showed that an increasing concentration of neuraminidase (VCN) used in pretreatment of RBC was associated with a decrease in both IgG uptake and CF activity. A maximum VCN effect reduced the Ig uptake to c 20% of normal and abolished almost all the CF activity. An impaired LISR to various degrees was also observed with RBC pretreated with ficin, papain, bromelin, trypsin or protamine, and RBC from two individuals of En(a-) type. Preincubation of serum at LIS with and without RBC resulted in respectively a 'complete' and partial consumption of C in the fluid phase. The latter was not enhanced or inhibited by the addition of VCN-treated RBC for preincubation. A hypothesis is proposed suggesting that in the LSR the Ig uptake by RBC is an electrostatic interaction of the oppositely charged RBC and Ig and the CF to RBC results from C activation by the cell-bound IgG and IgM. In addition, a pH-dependent inactivation of the cell-bound C3 in the LISR is demonstrated. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Fifty-eight patients with no more than moderate aortic insufficiency who underwent cardiac catheterization were evaluated with two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler velocimetry to determine the peak velocity across the stenotic valve and aortic valve area (AVA) by means of the continuity equation. All 33 peak Doppler velocities of greater than or equal to 4 m/sec had critical AS (AVA less than or equal to 0.8 cm2 at catheterization). Conversely, six of seven patients with Doppler velocities of less than or equal to 3 m/sec had noncritical AS. The patient with a falsely low peak velocity had severely depressed left ventricular function. Doppler velocity alone was inadequate in determining severity of AS for patients with velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec. The continuity equation proved accurate in estimating AVA in the 46 patients for whom catheterization and ultrasound data were sufficient to compare calculated AVA (r = 0.81), and was also accurate for those patients with peak Doppler velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec (r = 0.90). These results suggest that Doppler velocimetry alone is adequate in determining critical vs noncritical AS in many patients, while the continuity equation should be applied for patients with peak velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec as well as in patients with severely depressed cardiac function. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The study was double blinded, and agents were administered while the patients were being treated with a standard course of 10-day intramuscular ACTH therapy (40 U twice daily). Antiedema, alkalotic-hypocalcemic, extraadrenal, and sodium-retaining actions were studied using infusions of mannitol, sodium bicarbonate, ACTH, and sodium chloride, respectively. Seven of 8 patients receiving placebo infusions (2.5% glucose) showed no significant clinical change and 1 exhibited an equivocal improvement. Five of 9 patients receiving mannitol showed definite signs of clinical improvement phase-locked to drug administration, with subsequent gradual reversal to baseline. Similar improvements occurred with infusions of NaHCO3 in 5 of 8 patients and of ACTH in 4 of 8 patients. Three of 7 patients given NaCl infusion showed possible mild improvements. The results indicate that mannitol and NaHCO3 induced transient acute improvement in signs at the 95% confidence level in patients with exacerbating multiple sclerosis, with ACTH having a similar effect at the 90% confidence level.

The latter consists of cortical hypocirculation and an enhanced medullary blood flow in the presence of a relative rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This compensatory increment of GFR is mediated by a stimulation of prostaglandins (dilatation of vas afferens) as well as the renin-angiotensin- and adrenergic systems (contraction of vas efferens). Therapy with ACE inhibitors influences renal function in a complex manner. A decline in GFR resulting in the worst case in acute renal failure (ARF) may be caused by two pathogenetic possibilities: 1. critical reduction in renal perfusion pressure (below 70 mm Hg) and/or 2. loss of the autoregulation of GFR by relaxation of the constricted vas efferens induced by stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-systems (RAS). Activation of the RAS might be a consequence of severe renal hypocirculation as well as a diuretic induced volume and sodium depletion (contraction of the effective arterial blood volume). On the other hand, ACE inhibitors may improve renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. This may be due to a rise in cardiac output, dilatation of vas efferens and occasionally vas afferens and an increase of the ultrafiltration coefficient. The deterioration of renal function caused by ACE-inhibitors may be prevented by avoiding a volume and sodium deficit (withdrawal or reduction of diuretics) and careful titration of the ACE-inhibitor starting with lowest dosages. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Negative chemical ionization with chloride attachment is estimated to provide about 100 times higher response for the triacylglycerols and the trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers of diacylglycerols, and about 500 times higher response for the trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers of ceramides than positive chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Determination of the full negative chemical ionization mass spectra showed that each glycerolipid and ceramide species yielded a single ionic species corresponding to the chloride-attachment product of the parent ion. The cholesteryl esters and ethers failed to attach chloride and remained undetected by negative chemical ionization. However, the cholesteryl esters and ethers gave a high response for the steroid nucleus in positive chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Chloride attachment negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry is suitable for the unequivocal identification of plasma glycerolipids and ceramides in high-performance liquid chromatography and for the quantitation of molecular species in any unresolved peaks following appropriate calibration of the instrument response. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A single class of high affinity binding sites was found, Kd = 1.26 +/- 0.55 nM (N = 55) for the cytosolic extract and Kd = 1.96 +/- 0.42 nM (N = 8) for the nuclear extract. The Kd did not differ between males and females or between vitellogenic and nonvitellogenic females. The binding in both the cytosolic and nuclear extracts was specific for estrogens (DES greater than E2 much greater than E1 = E3). Receptor concentrations in cytosolic extracts from late vitellogenic females (14.61 +/- 1.07 pmol/g liver, N = 40) were significantly higher than those from nonvitellogenic females (3.91 +/- 0.73 pmol/g liver, N = 7). The nuclear binding capacity of livers from midvitellogenic females (1.12 +/- 0.45 pmol/g liver, N = 10) was significantly higher than the binding capacity in livers from nonvitellogenic females (0.16 +/- 0.07 pmol/g liver, N = 26), but not that of late vitellogenic females (0.80 +/- 0.09 pmol/g liver, N = 77). The concentration of estradiol-binding sites was greatest in the liver (liver much greater than ovary greater than heart greater than spleen greater than muscle greater than brain). No interference from other steroid-binding proteins was detected using a simple dextran-coated charcoal method to separate bound from free hormone. Approximately 14% of the binding in the cytosolic extract had DNA-binding affinity. Estrogen receptor binding activity was maximally extracted from nuclei with buffer containing 0.6 M KCl. Nuclear receptors eluted from gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 95 kDa. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Histone-free nuclei (nucleoids) extracted from treated cells have a reduced ability to maintain positive DNA supercoiling, with the maximum effect at the higher temperature. Prior exposure of cells to sodium ascorbate at 0 degree C increased both toxicity and the inhibition of nuclear supercoil rewinding. After exposure at 0 degrees C, normal levels of supercoiling returned with both a fast and a slow component, kinetics characteristic of DNA single-strand break repair; the fast component was eliminated when cells were exposed at 37 degrees C due to in situ rejoining. At least a portion of the lethal lesions induced by hydrogen peroxide are DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) because the dsb repair-deficient mutant, xrs-5, is approximately two to three times more sensitive than wild-type cells over the initial portion of the survival curve. However, the increased toxicity found after exposure at 37 degrees C is observed equally in both cell lines, indicating that temperature-dependent cell killing is not directly linked to DNA dsb. It is suggested that cell killing at 37 degrees C is mediated through two linked processes. First, hydrogen peroxide may disrupt cation-stabilized nuclear supercoiling by direct ion oxidation. Second, as a part of the oxidation process, hydrogen peroxide will produce potentially cytotoxic free radicals close to the DNA-linked metal site, limited in extent only by the presence of chemicals capable of reducing metal ions prior to reoxidation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To evaluate this hypothesis, we probed the NF-rich axonal swellings seen in normal spinal cords, \"globules\", and the larger ones, \"spheroids\", seen in the spinal cords of patients with motor neuron disease by using a library of monoclonal antibodies that recognize human NF proteins. These monoclonal antibodies discriminate different phosphorylation states of individual NF subunits. The NF protein determinants of globules and spheroids were similar to each other and to the determinants that predominate in normal spinal cord axons. NF protein-positive inclusion bodies were only seen in the anterior horn cells of one patient with motor neuron disease, and they contained NF protein determinants similar to those normally expressed in perikarya. Thus, the NFs in globules and spheroids appear to be derived from axonal NF proteins, and both kinds of axonal swellings may arise by similar mechanisms. Although our data do not exclude a structural defect in NF proteins to account for the accumulation of NFs in these axonal swellings, the hypotheses being advanced to explain the formation of NF-rich globules and spheroids based on intrinsic alterations of NF proteins must consider that the immunological integrity of disparate NF protein epitopes in different states of phosphorylation is retained in both globules and spheroids. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Microinvasive ductal carcinoma was defined as predominantly intraductal carcinoma with microscopic or early invasion. Surgical treatment of the primary tumor included excisional biopsy or wide resection. Axillary lymph node staging showed that 37 patients were pathologically node negative and two patients were pathologically node positive, each with only one positive lymph node. The median follow-up was 55 months (mean = 65 months; range = 25-135 months). The 5-year actuarial rate of overall and cause-specific survival were both 97%. The 5-year actuarial rate of freedom from distant metastases was 93%. Nine patients developed a recurrence in the breast; eight of the nine patients had isolated local only first failures, and one of the nine patients had a local recurrence simultaneously with distant metastases. The median time to local failure was 42 months (mean = 53 months; range = 20-116 months). Of the eight patients with local only first failure, seven patients have been salvaged with further treatment and remain free of disease at the time of last follow-up, and one patient has died of subsequent distant metastatic disease. Median follow-up after salvage treatment was 29 months (mean = 27 months; range = 0-54 months). Comparison of the patients with microinvasive ductal carcinoma with two control groups of intraductal carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma was performed. Although the rate of local failure was significantly higher for patients with microinvasive ductal carcinoma as compared to the two control groups, the rates of survival and freedom from distant metastases for patients with microinvasive ductal carcinoma were intermediate to the two control groups. Because of the high rates of survival and freedom from distant metastases and because of the ability to salvage patients with local recurrence, breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation should continue to be considered as an alternative to mastectomy for appropriately selected and staged patients with microinvasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Three isoform species of carbonic anhydrase and four isoforms related to ovalbumin eluted by anion-exchange chromatography were characterised by isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Gradient retention data were collected using several different alkali metal halides as the displacer salt, in order to systematically evaluate the effect on selectivity of different anions and cations in the series F-, Cl- and Br-, and Li+, Na+ and K+. While the selectivity between the different ovalbumin isoform species remained essentially constant with each displacer salt, solute Zc-values [J. Chromatogr., 458 (1988) 27] varied with the type of salt. In contrast, non-parallel retention plots were obtained for the carbonic anhydrase isoforms with the Zc values different for each isoform. Furthermore, significant differences in chromatographic behaviour for these proteins were observed between experiments carried out under gradient elution conditions with either varied gradient time and constant flow-rates or fixed gradient time and varied flow-rates. These results are discussed in terms of the influence of column residence time and protein-salt interactions of the solute's interactive ionotope and the concomitant effects these structural perturbations may have on chromatographic behaviour. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The method depends upon isopycnic zonal centrifugation using linear sucrose/Ficoll density gradients. Enrichment of plasma membrane marker enzymes with respect to trophoblast homogenate is found in two distinct peaks (designated B and D) of the fractionated effluent recovered from the rotor. Fraction B is enriched with membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase, but not with (Na+, K+)-ATPase of F(-)-stimulated adenylate cyclase. It is suggested that this material is derived from the maternal-facing microvillous plasma membrane. Fraction D, enriched with (Na+, K+)-ATPase, F(-)-stimulated adenylate cyclase and, to a smaller extent, with 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase is, by exclusion, proposed to be derived from the fetal-facing basal plasma membrane. Both plasma membrane fractions are shown to be free of appreciable contamination, using specific markers for endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, nuclei and lysosomes. The separation of the two membrane fractions is shown to depend both upon these membranes forming closed vesicles during homogenization and upon the buoyant densities of such vesicles differing in such a way that microvillous plasma membranes band at a lower density than basal plasma membranes. No separation of the membranes is achieved in gradients in which the vesicles are collapsed. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Diets containing 0, 1500, or 3000 ppm HC Blue 1 were fed to male and female rats and male mice; female mice received diets with 0, 3000, or 6000 ppm. Diets containing 0, 5000, or 10,000 ppm HC Blue 2 were fed to male rats and mice and the females received diets containing 0, 10,000 or 20,000 ppm. These concentrations were compatible with long-term growth and survival. The results demonstrated substantial differences in the neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions caused by these structural analogs. HC Blue 2 caused histocytosis in lungs and hyperostosis of the skull in rats, and splenic hematopoiesis, fibrous osteodystrophy, and hyperostosis of the skull in mice. These non-neoplastic lesions were not observed in rats or mice treated with HC Blue 1. Contrasting, in male and female mice, HC Blue 1 produced dose-related increases in the incidences of both adenomas and carcinomas of the liver. HC Blue 1 produced a marginally positive trend in hepatocellular nodules and carcinomas in male rats and dose-related increases in hyperplasias and neoplasms of the lungs in female rats. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity for HC Blue 2 in either sex of rats or mice, despite the fact that it was administered 3-5 times the dose of the HC Blue 1. Since these 2 nitroaromatic compounds differ only in the methyl vs. 2-hydroxyethyl substituent on the secondary amine of ring carbon 4, the great discordance in their carcinogenicity is most probably due to side group-directed alteration in their metabolic profiles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These viral infections are usual during childhood. The most common DNA viruses are: adenoviruses (more than 40 types), human papillomaviruses (HPV, more than 50 types) and Herpes viruses (herpes simplex type 1 and 2, varicella and Zooster, Epstein-Barr virus). Different clinical aspects are observed (exanthema, erythema, eruption, papillomas, vesicle, bullous) are well as histological signs. All of these viruses are replicating in the nuclei of epithelial cells which show eosinophilic inclusions and finally cell degeneresence with a typical aspect for each virus such as koilocyte for HPV infection. These lesions are commonly infiltrated with T lymphocytes; the intensity of the local cellular immune response varies with the lesion. LC are reduced in infected epithelia; they are sometimes found in conjunctive tissues and their morphology can be altered; their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes has only been demonstrated in herpes simplex virus infections. Profound modifications of membrane antigens of epithelial cells (loss of HLA class 1 antigen) might contribute to the disappearance of LC or to their functional inability. Most of the DNA virus infections are inapparent, benign and transient. However some lesions can evolve towards malignancy; this progression depends on the oncogenic potential of the viruses (such as HPV types 16 and 18 or herpes simplex virus type 2) associated to a local or a general immune deficiency of the patient as well as to other exogenous factors (UV for example). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The system has three goals: to collect data that can be used to evaluate possible causes of congenital anomalies, to improve diagnosis and treatment, and to let parents and physicians know what resources are available to aid children born with anomalies. All children (from birth to age 2) with congenital anomalies admitted to Virginia hospitals after January 1, 1987, are being reported to VaCARES; VaCARES then contacts their families and physicians. Before the system was implemented statewide, its procedures were thoroughly tested through two pilot projects in selected hospitals. During the pilots, it was concluded that birth certificates alone are inadequate for case ascertainment. According to hospital reports, the incidence of all congenital anomalies during Pilot II was 562 out of 10,034 births (5.6%); birth certificates showed an incidence of only 83 out of 10,034 births (0.8%). During Pilot I, 3,466 (73.8%) of the diagnoses reported were perinatal conditions; the list of reportable conditions was accordingly altered, reducing perinatal conditions reported in Pilot II to 5 diagnoses (0.4%). It was estimated that there will be about 5000 to 7000 reports submitted to VaCARES each year. It was also shown that parents should be sent general rather than specific information about their child's birth defect and that quality control and close contact with reporting hospitals are essential to maintain the integrity of the registry data. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Arcuate arteries are terminal branches of the uterine vaculature and supply only a circumscript area. Local vasoconstriction (due to contractions) and placental infarction may give erroneus results. Measurements in arcuate arteries at the site of placental insertion showed flow patterns different from those in the rest of the uterus. Since continuous wave Doppler systems were mostly applied, the received echoes could have originated from any part along the sound beam. Signals from arteries of the anterior abdominal wall may lead to \"false pathological\" waveforms. All these drawbacks have been overcome by Doppler velocimetry of the main stem uterine artery on its course through the parametrium by a transvaginal inserted probe that combines a 240 degrees \"panorama\" sector scanner with a pulsed Doppler system. Both main vessels supplying the uterus, i.e. left and right uterine artery, could be visually identified and pulsed Doppler velocimetry could be applied. This provided us with information about perfusion of the whole organ and showed us also the physiological range of left to right discrepancy in the flow patterns. In 63 pregnant women with a single foetus and an uneventful course of pregnancy we compared transabdominal measurements of the arcuate arteries with transvaginal measurements in both main uterine arteries. In 56 women we found pathological wave forms in the arcuate arteries (A/B ratio greater than 2) despite lack of clinical or transvaginal measured evidence of malnutrition.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Pentobarbital-anesthetized rats subjected to total occlusion of the superior mesenteric and the celiac arteries for 40 min developed a severe shock state, resulting in a uniformly fatal outcome after release of the occlusion. Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen at 2 ATA (atmosphere absolute) (1 ATA = 0.1 MPa) was initiated immediately after reperfusion. SAO shock rats exposed to hyperbaric oxygen maintained mean arterial blood pressure at significantly higher values throughout the postreperfusion period compared with untreated SAO shock rats (p less than 0.01), with final mean arterial blood pressures of 88 +/- 9 and 51 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively. Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen attenuated the increase in plasma activities of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (p less than 0.05), and diminished the increase of hematocrit (p less than 0.01 from untreated shock rats). Splanchnic occlusion shock rats treated with hyperbaric oxygen also exhibited a significantly higher survival rate than the untreated shock group (77 vs. 0%, respectively; p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of exposure to hyperbaric oxygen immediately after reperfusion of the splanchnic region outweigh its possible deleterious effect. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

PFA and PAA inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the Na+ gradient [Na+o greater than Na+i]-dependent uptake of Pi by rat kidney BBMV. PFA was a more potent inhibitor than PAA while phosphonopropionic acid, hydroxymethylphosphonic acid, and phenylphosphonic acid had no effect on Pi transport. The inhibitory effect of PFA was competitive (Ki approximately equal to 4.6 X 10(-4) M) and reversible upon dilution. The uptake of Pi by BBMV in the absence of Na+ gradient [Nao+ = Na+i] was also inhibited by PFA. The PFA had no effect on uptake of L-[3H]proline, D-[3H]glucose, or 22Na+ by BBMV nor did it alter intravesicular volume of BBMV. The relative (%) extent of inhibition by PFA was not altered by changes in the extravesicular pH or changes in the steepness of the Na+ gradient [Nao+ greater than Na+i]. The inhibition of PFA was analogous in renal BBMV from rats, mice, rabbits, or dogs. Unlike other known inhibitors of brush border membrane (BBM) transport of Pi, e.g. arsenate, NAD, and ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate, PFA and PAA had no inhibitory effect on BBM-bound or solubilized alkaline phosphatase. Also, PFA did not interfere with the activity of renal cortical (Na-K)ATPase. Administration of PFA (0.5 g/kg/day, intraperitoneally) to thyroparathyroidectomized rats fed a low Pi diet elicited an increase in urinary excretion of Pi, but did not change the excretion of Na+, K, and Ca2+.

Cytochemical and immunocytochemical protocols were employed to study the distribution of peroxisomes and the enzymes glycolate oxidase, glycine decarboxylase and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) in relation to synthesis of oxalate used for Ca oxalate formation. These enzymes are necessary for photorespiratory glycolate synthesis and metabolism. Using catalase cytochemistry, microbodies were found to exist in crystal idioblasts but were smaller and fewer than those found in mesophyll cells. Glycolate oxidase, which can oxidize glycolate to oxalate via glyoxylate, could not be found in microbodies of crystal idioblasts at any stage of development. This enzyme increased in amount in microbodies of mesophyll cells as they matured and could even be found in dense amorphous inclusions of mature cell peroxisomes. Glycine decarboxylase and RuBisCO could also be detected in increasing amount in mesophyll cells as they matured but could not be detected in idioblasts or were just detectable. Thus, Lemna idioblasts lack the machinery for synthesis of oxalate from glycolate. Based on these results and other available information, two general models for the generation and accumulation of oxalate used for Ca oxalate formation in crystal idioblasts are proposed. The biochemical specialization of crystal idioblasts indicated by this study is also discussed with respect to differentiation of cellular structure and function. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Substance P and neurokinin alpha were found to be distributed in a very similar manner with fairly constant molar ratios i.e. ratios of substance P to neurokinin alpha were 3.69 in the dorsal root ganglia, 3.49 in the dorsal root and 3.09 in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord. On the other hand, the distribution of neurokinin beta was different from other tachykinins; although concentrated in the dorsal horn, neurokinin beta in the dorsal root ganglia or in the dorsal roots was negligibly small in amount. When the cervical dorsal roots were sectioned unilaterally, substance P and neurokinin alpha were decreased in a parallel fashion in the dorsal horn, whereas neurokinin beta was not. In addition neurokinin alpha was selectively and significantly decreased in the dorsal horn of the intact side when compared to that in the unoperated control rat. Since the magnitude of a decrease of neurokinin alpha in molar basis was approximately the same as a decrease of substance P, these findings suggest that the neurokinin alpha and substance P-containing primary afferent fibres could project partly to the contralateral dorsal horn as well. When the thoracic spinal cord was transected, substance P (and neurokinin alpha) was decreased in the ventral part of the lumbar spinal cord, suggesting the presence of tachykinin(s)-containing descending fibres.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation. Reliability is basic to any scientific measure. Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure. Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained. Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized. Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not. An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated. Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database. Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales. Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed. Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce. Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources. Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A strain was defined as serum-resistant when less than 50% and serum-sensitive when greater than 90% bacteria were killed. Fifty-seven reference strains were serum-sensitive, 21 of them produced K antigens which apparently had no protective role. Thirty-seven reference strains were serum-resistant, and 13 of these produced no K antigen; thus the O antigens might by themselves be protective in these cases. K- mutants of the serum-resistant O8:K87 strains were serum-sensitive, and the O9:K9 strain changed from being serum-resistant to being partly resistant when the K antigen was lost; mutants of the O6:K13 strain with no or a small amount of K13 were less resistant than the original K+ strain; similar mutants of the O22:K13 reference strain did not show any decrease in serum resistance. Strongly related to 022 is 083, and results with several 083 strains pointed to the importance of this O antigen for serum resistance. In an O83:K14 strain a spontaneous variation occurred in LPS from a few to many repeating units; this variation was accompanied by a change from serum sensitivity to serum resistance. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Iontophoretic application of GABA increased membrane conductance to chloride ions, and prolonged application resulted in desensitization. Hill coefficients, determined from dose-response data, indicated that binding of at least two GABA molecules was required to activate the chloride channel. Differences between vertebrate GABAA receptors and insect neuronal GABA receptors were detected. For the GABA receptor of motor neuron Df, the following rank order of potency was observed: isoguvacine greater than muscimol greater than or equal to GABA greater than 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was inactive. Of the potent vertebrate GABA receptor antagonists (bicuculline, pitrazepin, RU5135 and picrotoxin), only picrotoxin (10(-7) M) produced a potent, reversible block of the response to GABA of motor neuron Df. Both picrotoxinin and picrotin also blocked GABA-induced currents. Bicuculline hydrochloride (10(-4) M) and bicuculline methiodide (10(-4) M) were both ineffective when applied at resting membrane potential (-65 mV), although at hyperpolarized levels partial block of GABA-induced current was sometimes observed. Pitrazepin (10(-4) M) caused a partial, voltage-independent block of GABA-induced current. The steroid derivative RU5135 was inactive at 10(-5) M. In contrast to the potent competitive blockade of vertebrate GABAA receptors by bicuculline, pitrazepin and RU5135, none of the weak antagonism caused by these drugs on the insect GABA receptor was competitive. Flunitrazepam (10(-6) M) potentiated GABA responses, providing evidence for a benzodiazepine site on an insect GABA-receptor-chloride-channel complex. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this report, a mouse model of BMT, in which the donor and host were compatible at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), was used (1) to examine the interrelationship of pretransplant conditioning and T-cell content of donor BM with regard to lymphoid chimerism and GVHD and (2) to determine how these factors affected graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor-host-tolerance. AKR (H-2k) host mice were administered optimal or suboptimal total body irradiation (TBI) as pretransplant conditioning followed by administration of BM cells from B10.BR (H-2k) donor mice with or without added spleen cells as a source of T lymphocytes. Transplanted mice were injected with a supralethal dose of AKR leukemia cells 20 and 45 days post-BMT to assess GVL reactivity in vivo. The pretransplant conditioning of the host and T-cell content of the donor marrow affected the extent of donor T-cell chimerism and the severity of GVH disease. GVL reactivity was dependent on transplantation of mature donor T cells and occurred only in complete chimeras. Transplantation of T-cell-deficient BM resulted in the persistence of host T cells, ie, incomplete donor T-cell chimerism, even when lethal TBI was used. Mixed chimerism was associated with a lack of GVL reactivity, despite the fact that similar numbers of donor T cells were present in the spleens of mixed and complete chimeras. In this model, moderate numbers of donor T cells facilitated complete donor T-cell engraftment, caused only mild GVHD, and provided a significant GVL effect without preventing the subsequent development of tolerance after conditioning with suboptimal TBI. In contrast, severe, often lethal, GVHD developed when the dose of TBI was increased, whereas tolerance and no GVH/GVL reactivity developed when the T-cell content of the marrow was decreased. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The stimuli were sinusoidal gratings whose contrast was temporally modulated about some mean value. Electrophysiologically determined contrast modulation thresholds were measured at standing contrast over the range from 2.5% to 50%, defining an increment threshold function. Increment threshold functions were obtained under two different spatio-temporal stimulus conditions identified as \"sustained\" (4 c/deg grating modulated at 1.5 Hz) and \"transient\" (1 c/deg grating modulated at 20 Hz). Under each of these conditions, threshold responses were retrieved at both the fundamental and second harmonic of the contrast modulation frequency. Under \"sustained\" conditions log increment threshold responses and the fundamental the second harmonic of the modulation frequency were similar to those at the fundamental except for a saturation effect (i.e., above a mean contrast of 25% there was little further reduction in modulation sensitivity). There was no contrast gain control under \"transient\" stimulus conditions. In other words, the same absolute amount of contrast change produced threshold responses for all mean levels up to 25%. This was true at both the fundamental and second harmonic of the modulation frequency. Stimulus differences produce striking differences in the electrophysiologically inferred increment threshold function for grating contrast, but fundamental and second harmonic evoked responses reflect processes with similar increment threshold behavior. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The victims, mostly male (male/female ratio, 26:6), were between 21 and 71 years old (mean age, 38 years). Although the scene of self-immolation was usually familiar to the deceased, some chose remote locations. Eleven were found dead in motor vehicles. An accelerant, usually gasoline, was used in most cases. Many of these individuals had, at some time, indicated their intent to commit suicide, a few by self-immolation, but only about half had a diagnosed psychiatric illness. Most of the victims had a reason to kill themselves, but the factors that motivated them to chose self-immolation by fire were uncertain. Fourteen individuals died in hospitals from severe burn complications. The remainder were found dead at the scene. The postmortem findings of soot in the airway and elevated carbon monoxide in the blood of most of these victims [the carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentration was in one case less than 10%, in ten cases greater than or equal to 10 to 50%, and in seven cases greater than 50%] were helpful in determining that the individuals were not only alive at the time of the fire but also that a significant number died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The highest levels of carbon monoxide were observed in victims discovered in motor vehicles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Low intensity components occurred at low doses of apomorphine and high intensity components at larger doses but the two components never occurred independently for (minus)-NPA or (plus or minus) NPA. Biting was the predominant effect of these agents which were shown to be at least twenty times more potent than apomorphine. The (minus)-isomer of NPA was the more potent. The two components of stereotypy were differentiated both pharmacologically (using amantadine, reserpine plus alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and haloperidol) and by lesions placed in areas of the extrapyramidal (caudate--putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) and mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens septi, tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus amygdaloideus centralis) systems. However, both sniffing and biting responses  were reduced by lesions of the serotonergic raphe nuclei. The two stereotypic components were differentially induced by intracerebral injections of apomorphine and (minus)-NPA into the caudate--putamen, nucleus accumbens septi and tuberculum olfactorium. Injections into the central nucleus of the amygdala were ineffective. The degree of involvement of the different areas was shown to differ for apomorphine and (minus)-NPA, in particular the nucleus accumbens septi appeared more important for the action of (minus)-NPA and the tuberculum olfactorium for apomorphine. Intracaudate (minus)-NPA was less active than apomorphine but, generally, intracerebrally applied (minus)-NPA was twice as potent as apomorphine. Both (minus)-NPA and apomorphine caused circling behaviour in animals with asymmetric medial raphe nucleus lesions (contralateral) or unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra (ipsilateral). In these experiments (minus)-NPA was ten times more potent than apomorphine. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Rats were anesthetized and basal and secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice was obtained. Pancreatic glands were isolated and divided into portions for histology, biochemical analyses, and cell fractionation. The homogenate, zymogen granule fraction, mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction, microsomal fraction and postmicrosomal supernatant as well as aliquots of pancreatic juice were analyzed for cathepsin B, acid phosphatase, beta-D-glucoronidase, arylsulphatase and leucine naphthylamidase. All of the ethanol-fed animals developed morphological changes akin to human chronic pancreatitis. There were focal areas of parenchymal degeneration with fibrosis, protein plug formation and tubular complexes. In the pancreatic tissue of animals fed ethanol, total protein, trypsinogen (and free trypsin) were increased and amylase was decreased. While acid phosphatase was increased in all of the particulate fractions, cathepsin B was increased in the zymogen granule and mitochondrial-lysosomal fractions. Basal and post-secretin pancreatic juice did not show a significant increase in digestive or lysosomal enzymes. It is suggested that focal degenerative changes may be due to trypsin generated by intracellular activation of digestive enzymes by lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Concerning future developments, that article concluded that the major challenge lay in (a) the improvement of the reliability and clinical relevance of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) monitoring, where the incidence of false-negative and false-positive results had to be reduced, and (b) the application of new techniques like motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring, which might turn out to be a method complementary to the SEP approach. Since that time, there has been a considerable amount of newly published results from intraoperative SCM, although clinical articles on exclusively neurosurgical SCM are rare (Table I). A selective literature search for the present review (primarily for the time from 1988 to 1992) yielded more than 200 citations. Eighty-one studies entered into the final evaluation; among these were 3 conference proceedings, 6 book chapters, and 10 review articles. Further, 40 clinical articles, and 22 articles on experimental work were counted. In particular, experimental studies in animals have given support to clinical monitoring by exploring the usefulness of new stimulation and recording techniques. This reappraisal only considers recent work on SEP and MEP in neurosurgical SCM with some experimental studies relevant to clinical SCM.

It has also been shown that vascular Na,K-pump activity and myocardial Na+K+ATPase activity [the energy source for active sodium (Na) and potassium (K) transport] are decreased in rats with various forms of low renin hypertension including rats with reduced renal mass-saline (RRM-saline) hypertension. In the present study, left ventricular Na+K+ATPase activity from rats with RRM-saline hypertension was found to be decreased in membranes prepared by two independent methods: deoxycholate, sodium iodide (Nal)-treated microsomal fractions (method 1) and membranes prepared by the hypotonic, lithium bromide (LiBr) method (method 2). Relative to RRM normotensive control rats which drank distilled water, myocardial Na+K+ATPase activity from RRM-saline drinking rats was decreased by 18.2% in membranes prepared by method 1 and 33.6% in membranes prepared by method 2. The apparent affinities of Na+K+ATPase for K and for ouabain were unaltered relative to controls in membranes prepared from these hypertensive rats by method 1, and the sialic acid content and 5'-nucleotidase activity (two putative sarcolemmal markers) were unaltered in membranes from the hypertensive rats, prepared by methods 1 and 2 respectively. The Mg2+ATPase activity of membranes prepared by method 1 was increased in the RRM-saline hypertensive rats but because it was not increased in membranes prepared by method 2 the former observation does not appear to be of any pathophysiological importance. In other experiments, hypertension was reversed in RRM-saline hypertensive rats by restricting their salt intake (substitution of distilled water for drinking).\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Surprisingly, however, endogenous immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and significant heavy chain polypeptide production does occur. We tested the hypothesis that only CD5+ B cells produce endogenous immunoglobulin by taking advantage of the fact that X-linked immune deficient (xid) mice normally are deficient in CD5+ B cells. We found that the frequency of CD5+ splenic B cells was similar in XxidY transgenic and non-transgenic F1 males, and in XxidX transgenic and non-transgenic F1 females. In both XxidX and XxidY transgenic F1 mice some, but not all, splenic B cells are CD11b+. There was a striking deficit of splenic B cells expressing endogenous immunoglobulin in XxidY transgenic mice, although this was not true for peritoneal cells. Thus, the introduction of the 17.2.25 mu transgene does not prevent the development of CD5- B cells nor does it limit endogenous immunoglobulin gene arrangement and expression solely to CD5+ B cells. However, in mice capable of expressing B cell surface CD5 or CD11 this transgene can lead to expansion of the fraction of B cells positive for these molecules. We conclude that while the introduction of the 17.2.25 mu transgene alters the frequencies of B cell populations, maturation is not limited to one subpopulation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This method does not involve administration of a toxic chemical or retention of a foreign body. Ulceration was produced by means of applying a steel rod, 5 mm in diameter, frozen at -78 C, to the serosal surface of the bladder for 2 seconds, twice, with a 5-second interval between each application. Sequential histologic observations showed that ulcers were accompanied by necrosis of the entire thickness of the bladder at the site of freezing with extensive acute inflammation. Regenerative hyperplasia was evident at the edge of the ulcer by the second day, with greatest severity at 5 days when papillary and nodular hyperplasia were present. At 15 days the bladders were normal or had only minimal hyperplasia. The labeling index by autoradiography was highest in the mildly hyperplastic area near the ulcer at 2 days and remained relatively high through 5 days. The hyperplastic epithelium surrounding the ulcer observed by scanning electron microscopy had numerous degenerative cells on the surface, and small epithelial cells with numerous short, uniform microvilli on their luminal surface were also observed. The numerous short, uniform microvilli on their luminal surface were also observed. The microvilli had a symmetric luminal membrane, as observed on trasmission electron microscopy. More peripherally the cells had microridges only or microvilli and microridges on their luminal surface. Neither pleomorphic microvili nor a structured glycocalyx fuzz on microvilli was observed during the process of regenerative hyperplasia, distinguishing it from neoplastic bladder proliferations. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These experiments were designed to elucidate the mechanism of OTP-induced protection with respect to an apparent non-GSH-dependent system. Marked differences in the relative amounts of hepatic GSH content depleted by AAP in control vs OTP-treated hamsters occurred. Urinary recoveries of AAP and metabolites indicated that more AAP-glucuronide was formed at the expense of other major metabolites (AAP-GSH, -N-acetylcysteine, and -sulfate) in OTP-treated hamsters, while plasma toxicokinetic modeling suggested a greater rate of AAP systemic clearance. An increased apparent formation rate constant for AAP glucuronidation (135%), in concert with significantly lower apparent formation rate constants for those metabolites which reflect the production of the reactive intermediate from AAP (glutathione and N-acetylcysteine), provide the rationale for this shift of metabolism. The biochemical basis for metabolic shunting is significantly elevated hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid content, an increased calculated UDP-glucuronic acid synthetic rate, and an increased liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity in OTP-treated animals. These changes in AAP conjugation were concomitant with decreased fractional clearance of AAP via bioactivation and less in vivo AAP covalent binding. These data support the hypothesis that OTP provides a protecting effect from AAP hepatotoxicity due to an augmented and predisposing glucuronidation capacity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The relationship between moderate drinking and low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) among a nationally representative sample of white married mothers who gave birth to singletons infants in the National Natality Survey (1980) is analysed here. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was significantly associated with birth weight (p less than 0.02). Moreover, there was a gradient of risk in low birth weight associated with increasing amount of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy. There was a significant association between the mean birth weight of the singletons across different categories of alcohol intake (p less than 0.0001). The difference between the mean birth weight of the singletons among moderate drinkers compared with nondrinkers was also statistically significant (p less than 0.005). These relationships remained after simultaneously adjusting effects of the confounding variables gestational age, parity, smoking, weight gain, maternal age and education in multiple regression analyses. These findings confirm earlier reports of a relationship between alcohol use during pregnancy and decreased birth weight.

Even the use of highly technical examination methods mostly does not allow differentiation of specific hip problems and do not give exact information about the extent and stage of the lesion. This applies specifically for rheumatoid diseases. Arthroscopy of the hip joint, like other big joints of the extremities, closes this diagnostic gap. Directly visualized findings on the joint, in addition to the results of joint aspiration and histological biopsies, give one security in finding the right diagnosis and planning adequate therapy. The conventional surgical approach to the hip joint leads to large wounds and to corresponding risks and damage to the patient. The advantages of arthroscopy are obvious. It was shown that arthroscopic surgery can be used very efficiently in cases with loose-body, osteochondrosis dissecans, scattered cartilage fragments, or septic arthritis. The other therapeutic application is in cases with rheumatoid arthritis where an arthroscopically assisted synovectomy to the hip achieves a high rate of success without temporary luxation. Diagnostic arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery to the hip have been used in the Orthopedic Department of the University of Ulm since autumn of 1984. The possibilities and limitations of this surgical procedure have been evaluated in more than 100 cases. Based on our experience with arthroscopy on hip joints, we think that this procedure is very helpful for making a diagnosis and administering therapy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Therefore, feeding strategies should aim to minimize weight loss and maintain a sow's body condition throughout her reproductive life. The efficiency with which gilts are introduced into the breeding herd is as important in economic terms as is the efficiency with which the sow returns to estrus after weaning. Gilts should be selected at 50 to 60 kg, and fed a 16% protein diet ad libitum until mated at their second estrus, when they weigh 115 to 120 kg and have 17 to 20 mm backfat. Flushing gilts before the onset of second or third estrus increases ovulation rate of restricted gilts to the levels achieved by gilts fed ad libitum. During gestation, maintenance represents 75 to 85% of total energy requirements. The aim should be to achieve 20 to 25 mm backfat at farrowing. Increased feed intake from day 2 to 3 after mating will not increase embryo mortality. Feeding an extra 1 kg feed/sow/day for the last 10 days of gestation increases piglet birth weight slightly and prevents a loss of 1.5 to 2.0 mm of sow backfat. Wherever possible, sows should be fed ad libitum from the day after farrowing until weaning. Reduced feed intake by lactating sows, for whatever reason, results in excessive weight and condition loss. Excessive weight loss in lactation causes extended remating intervals, a lower percentage of sows returning to estrus within 10 days of weaning, reduced pregnancy rate, and reduced embryo survival. Ovulation rate is not affected by level of feed intake in lactation. It has been suggested that sows will have minimum weaning-to-service intervals when they weigh 150 kg or more at weaning. It is likely that the sow must be anabolic for about 10 days before she will exhibit postweaning estrus. The decision when to rebreed is made some time prior to weaning and is mediated by a host of substrates, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Sows with a delayed return to estrus also have a lower pregnancy rate and smaller subsequent litters. If sows lose considerable weight or condition during lactation, a high level of feeding in the postweaning period will improve embryo survival. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Their symptoms consisted mainly of angina (6 patients), with dyspnoea and palpitation being the presenting features in the remaining two patients. All patients underwent preoperative coronary angiography which confirmed stenosis at the level of the orifice with absence of reflux of contrast medium into the sinus of Valsalva as the main features. Delay in the appreciation of stenosis of the orifice of the right coronary artery resulted in the death of two patients, whose diagnosis was confirmed at post mortem examinations.

Many neurons were penetrated which failed to produce action potentials on the application of large depolarizing currents. Nevertheless, some of them strongly excited and/or inhibited slow motoneurons innervating leg musculature, even with weak depolariziing musculature, even with weak depolarizing currents. Cobalt-sulfide-straining of these nonspiking neurons showed them to be interneurons with their neurites contained entirely within the metathoracic ganglion. Two further characteristics of these interneurons were rapid spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential and a low resting membrane potential. One nonspiking neuron, interneuron I, when depolarized caused a strong excitation of the set of slow levator motoneurons which discharge in bursts during stepping movements of the metathoracic leg. During rhythmic leg movements the membrane potential of interneuron I oscillated with the depolarizing phases occurring at the same time as bursts of activity in the levator motorneurons. No spiking or any other nonspiking neuron was penetrated which could excite these levator motoneurons. From all these observations we conclude that oscillations in the membrane potential of interneuron I are entirely responsible for producing the levator bursts, and thus for producing stepping movements in a walking animal. During rhythmic leg movements, bursts of activity in levator and depressor motoneurons are initiated by slow graded depolarizations. The similarity of the synaptic activity in these two types of motoneurons suggests that burst activity in the depressor motoneurons is also produced by rhythmic activity in nonspiking interneurons. The fact that no spiking neuron was found to excite the depressor motoneurons supports this conclusion. Interneuron I is also an element of the rhythm-generating system, since short depolarizing pulses applied to it during rhythmic activity could reset the thythm. Long-duration current pulses applied to interneuron I in a quiescent animal did not produce rhythmic activity. This observation, together with the finding that during rhythmic activity the slow depolarizations in interneuron I are usually terminated by IPSPs, suggests that interneuron I alone does not generate the rhythm. No spiking interneurons have yet been enccountered which influence the activity in levator motoneurons. Thus, we conclude that the rhythm is generated in a network of nonspiking interneurons. The cellular mechanisms for generating the oscillations in this network are unknown. Continued. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

All measurements we performed on basic and magnetic rate of the pulse generator. V-a conduction time was defined as mean (from 5 measurements) time from spike of the pulse generator to the first deflection of P wave recorded from esophagus and expressed in miliseconds. We compared v-a conduction time (v-act) on basic and magnetic rates of a stimulator and between groups with normal (group A, 49 pts) and prolonged a-v conduction time (group B, 30 pts). Group B was divided on group B-1 (19 pts without bundle branch blocks) and B-2 (11 pts with bundle branch blocks during observations). V-act during magnetic rate (cycle 596 +/- 70 ms) was significantly longer than during basic rate (cycle 834 +/- 66 ms) (191 +/- 48 ms vs 185 +/- 44 ms, p 0.05). V-act in patients with a-v block (group B) was significantly longer than in patients with normal a-v conduction (group B) (219 +/- 45 ms vs 190 +/- 47 ms, p 0.02). The longest v-act was observed in group B-2 (236 +/- 32 ms). 1. Ventriculo-atrial conduction time could be measured in patients with permanent VVI stimulation using esophageal ECG recording. 2. Shortening of the stimulation cycle prolonges ventriculo-atrial conduction time. 3. Ventriculo-atrial conduction time is longest in group with atrio-ventricular conduction disturbances, especially in group with registered bundle branch block. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The hydrophobic properties of AChE forms were studied by phase-partition of Triton X-114 and Triton X-100-solubilized enzyme and by comparing their migration in sucrose gradient containing either Triton X-100 or Brij 96. We found that in the microsomal preparation two hydrophilic 13.5 S and 10.5 S forms and an amphiphilic 4.5 S form exist. The 13.5 S is an asymmetric molecule which by incubation with collagenase and trypsin is converted into a 'lytic' 10.5 S form. The hydrophobic 4.5 S form is the predominant one in extracts prepared with Triton X-100. Proteolytic digestion of the membranes with trypsin brought into solution a significant portion of the total activity. Incubation of the membranes with phospholipase C failed to solubilize the enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient of the amphiphilic 4.5 S form remained unchanged after partial reduction, thus confirming its monomeric structure. Conversion of the monomeric amphiphilic form into a monomeric hydrophilic molecule was performed by incubating the 4.5 S AChE with trypsin. This conversion was not produced by phospholipase treatment. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Different dosages and routes of administration (1.5 IU.kg-1 and 0.75 IU kg-1 IM, and 1.5 IU.kg-1 via nasal spray) were compared. sCT caused an increase in cAMP, adenosine and pO2, and a decrease in cytosolic free calcium in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. The peak times of all these parameters ranged between 109 and 182 min, and 101 and 168 min after IM and nasal spray administration respectively. There was greater variability in the values after IM than nasal spray of administration of sCT. It is concluded that adenosine and pO2 in venous blood, and cytosolic free calcium in circulating cells are valuable markers of the activity of sCT and that sCT decreases the cytosolic free calcium level in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. Pharmacodynamic analysis of the biological effects of the drug is highly reliable and valuable in predicting its pharmacological profile. sCT administration via a nasal spray is able to produce significant biological effects, although they are less marked than after IM dosing. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This cell population, however, also contained 30-50% previously undescribed cells expressing very low levels of CD3/TCR gamma delta (CD3/TCR gamma delta low; approximately 60% of which expressed the variable region gene V delta 1). Correspondingly, TCR gamma and TCR delta gene rearrangements (predominantly V delta 1/joining region J delta 1) and full-length TCR gamma and TCR delta transcripts (but only immature TCR beta and no TCR alpha mRNAs) were found. These cells mobilized Ca2+ in response to ligation of CD3 but not following ligation of TCR gamma delta. When cultured in the presence of interleukin 7 or interleukin 2, these thymocytes gave rise to 30-60% CD3/TCR gamma delta medium and high cells (60-70% expressing V delta 1) seen as discrete populations. Thus, the proportion and V delta phenotype of in vitro generated CD3/TCR gamma delta cells closely resembled those of CD3/TCR gamma delta low cells in freshly isolated \"thymocyte precursor\" preparations. Small numbers of TCR alpha beta + cells also appeared. It is thus uncertain whether maturation, differentiation, or both account for the appearance of mature CD3/TCR+ thymocytes, although the former appears most likely. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In a group of 77 patients and in 48 individual patients the levels of calcium, phosphorus, hydroxyproline and nitrogen were studied for four successive days. Calcium was administered by the intravenous route on the third day (186 mg). The results were compared to 16 healthy controls. Analysis was made with reference to the differences in sex, age, stature and anabolic therapy. The products eliminated were referred in absolute amounts to the body surface and to the period of 1 minute. 91 patients and 17 healthy controls were subjected to a provoked hypercalciuria test. Five patients were followed up in a 47Ca kinetic study and its result was compared to the content of Ca/P and P/Ca in serum and urine found in the same patients and in 21 healthy controls. The biological profile was also compared to a group of patients with gonarthrosis and varose deformity and to 127 patients with inflammatory joint diseases. From the results it is assumed that in women with decompensated coxarthrosis and gonarthrosis the syndrome of disease is a bone manifestation which affects the mineral bone substrate and particularly its calcium level. Phosphorus and the organic products of bone (nitrogen and hydroxyproline) of these patients are susceptible to intravenous administration of calcium. In women the metabolism of collagen appears to be more active than that seen in controls, and tends to resemble that of phosphorus. With its lower activity calcium tends to relate to noncollagenic products, such as osseomucoid (glycoprotein, proteoglycan) and osseoalbumoid. In accord with the findings, the patients show a higher miscible pool of calcium (47Ca), and its lower elimination (in urine and stools) and lower accretion to bone. There are a number of factors (sex, stature, age, clinical compensation of disease) that must be taken into consideration when evaluating the results. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Sex differences were found in the binding density and patterns of [3H]naloxone-labeled receptors. The distribution and density of [3H][D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin-labeled delta-receptors in adjacent brain sections were similar in males and females. Male hamsters showed a U-shaped pattern of [3H]naloxone binding in the sexually dimorphic nuclear complex with 28% and 34% greater labeling of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) and bed nucleus/stria terminalis (BNST), respectively, than periovulatory estrous females. Estrous and diestrous females showed a V-shaped pattern of [3H]naloxone binding in the same region, but binding density was higher at diestrus. Greater specific [3H]naloxone binding in diestrous females was also evident following extensive prewashing of slide-mounted tissue sections indicating that residual endogenous opioids were not occupying receptors, and thus, reducing the labeling of receptors in tissue from estrous females. An estrous-linked change in the affinity of hypothalamic opiate receptors was suggested by findings that [3H]naloxone binding density was greater in tissue from diestrous females when incubations were conducted in the presence of a 1-nM, but not a 10-nM, concentration of the labeled antagonist. Finally, a dense are of [3H]naloxone binding was discovered in the dorso-suprachiasmatic region of the hypothalamus. These data provide evidence for a sexual dimorphism in the distribution and density of opiate receptors in hamsters. The data suggest that mu- or kappa-receptors are more likely than delta-receptors to be involved in mediating hypothalamic effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids on reproductive functions in this species. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this period 21% left, most of them (80%) were unable to become socialized, they all became jobless. In order to explain differences in turnover because of unsuccessful socialization ten explanatory variables were applied in a stepwise regression analysis: age, education, gender, marital status, handicap diagnosis, disability benefit, visibility of the handicap, compulsory placement, in-service training and prognosis of turnover as expected by rehabilitation professionals (occupational health doctors and personnel officers). The best predictor variable controlling for all other explanatory variables involved, appeared to be the prognosis of turnover (beta = .33, p less than .001). Other significant predictors are: compulsory placement (beta = .19, p less than .001), in-service training (beta = .17, p less than .001), mental handicap (beta = .13, p less than .001), disability benefit (beta = 0.09, p less than .01) and marital status (beta = 0.05, p less than .05). One may conclude that vocational rehabilitation professionals can, to a certain degree, predict the amount of unsuccessful socialization. It is hypothesized that their predictions can compete with predictive power of standardized pre-employment tests.

These stomachs are well innervated and generate signals which are thought to be important in the control of voluntary food intake. Tension receptors in the muscular wall of the rumen and reticulum are slowly adapting and provide a measure of distension while epithelial receptors are rapidly adapting and provide information on the fibrousness of the digesta; they are involved in the control of stomach motility and voluntary food intake in order to prevent excessive distension. The epithelial receptors are also sensitive to the chemical nature of the digesta, particularly acidity. There are mechano- and chemoreceptors in the abomasum (true stomach) and duodenum and chemoreceptors in the liver, all of which have been implicated in the control of intake. It is relatively easy to prepare and maintain ruminants with a rumen fistula and many studies have shown the effects of such manipulations as distension of balloons in the rumen on voluntary intake. With fibrous, slowly digested feeds intake is primarily limited by rumen distension. With more rapidly digested feeds, however, the products of digestion play an important role in controlling intake. Short-chain fatty acids are the main products of fermentation and infusion of their salts into the rumen depresses food intake to a much greater extent than infusion into the general circulation. Acetate or propionate given into the rumen are more effective, mole for mole, than butyrate but must be given at rates exceeding the natural rate of production in order to have a significant effect. It has been suggested that much of the effect of sodium acetate is via the increase in the osmolality of rumen fluid but there is considerable uncertainty as to the physiological significance of osmotic effects, especially when animals have free access to water and can prevent excessive increases in tonicity by increasing their water intake. Other constituents of rumen fluid have been implicated in the control of food intake, particularly lactic acid and nitrogenous compounds, especially as these can be found in fermented feeds such as silage. The omasum controls the flow of digesta to the abomasum; it is therefore well placed to control rumen fill and thus intake but there has been little study in this area and this is also true for the abomasum.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In most cases a distinctive rearrangement of intramembrane particles, as discerned by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, began abruptly at a definitive temperature. By comparing the freeze-fracture patterns of membranes in cells grown at 39.5, 27, and 15 degrees C, it was shown that the initial particle rearrangement in a given membrane always occurred at a fixed number of degrees below the growth temperature of the cell. Gradual chilling of a cell grown at constant temperature induced these membrane changes first in the outer alveolar membrane, then, in order of decreasing response to temperature, in the endoplasmic reticulum, outer mitochondrial membrane, nuclear envelope, and vacuolar membrane. The normally stable relationships between the physical properties of the several membrane types could in some cases be reversed, but only temporarily, by fatty acid supplementation or during the initial phases of acclimation to growth at a different temperature. The system provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of environmental change upon the physical properties of several functionally distinct but metabolically interrelated membranes within a single cell. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After centrifugation at 87,000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was subjected to purification through successive column chromatography as follows: i) DEAE-cellulose, ii) Ultrogel (AC-34) filtration, iii) Phenyl-Sepharose, iv) a second DEAE-cellulose. The enzyme activity was assayed using azocasein as substrate. The myelin enzyme was purified 2072-fold and SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed a major subunit of 72-76 K. The enzyme was inhibited by iodoacetate (1 mM), leupeptin (1 mM), E-64C (1.6 mM), EGTA (1 mM), antipain (2 mM) and endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (2 micrograms). It required 0.8 mM Ca2+ for half-maximal activation and 5 mM Ca2+ for optimal activation. Mg2+ (5 mM) was ineffective while Zn2+ and Hg2+ were inhibitory. The pH optimum was ranged from 7.5-8.5. Treatment of myelin with Triton X-100 increased the enzyme activity by 10-fold suggesting it is membrane bound whereas the purified enzyme was not activated by Triton X-100 treatment.

They have a matrix space containing the enzymes of the citrate cycle and beta-oxidation, enclosed by an inner membrane containing the 4 complexes of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase and specific carriers for metabolites. Mitochondria also have a relatively permeable outer membrane and an intermembrane space. ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) is critically dependent on the structural integrity of the mitochondrion. Electrons from substrate oxidations feed into the electron transport chain at complex I or complex II, and then successively flow to complex III, complex IV and finally to oxygen. Complexes I, III and IV are redox pumps and electron transport causes extrusion of protons from the matrix generating an electrochemical proton gradient (proton motive force) across the inner membrane. Protons return to the matrix 'through' ATP synthase driving the synthesis of ATP. The stoichiometry of proton extrusion and the yield of ATP are still uncertain. Mitochondria have genetic continuity and are inherited maternally. They possess a small amount of DNA which codes for some, but not all, of the subunits of complexes I, III, IV of ATP synthase. mtDNA also codes for mitochondrial ribosomal and messenger RNAs involved in the synthesis of mitochondrially coded subunits. All other mitochondrial peptides are synthesised on cytosolic ribosomes and are imported and targeted to their specific intramitochondrial locations, often after proteolytic removal of leader sequences. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

To investigate the kinetics of this gamma-IFN induction and the effector cells involved, we used a highly purified SpA preparation, PBL from healthy volunteers, and a CPE-inhibition gamma-IFN assay with Sindbis virus in human fibroblasts. The production of SpA-induced gamma-IFN (SpA-gamma-IFN) peaked 48 h after the addition of SpA to cultures of PBL and decreased after 72 h. Subpopulations of PBL were purified by depletion using specific monoclonal antibodies and complement; CD4+ or OKT4+ (T4: helper/inducer) cells were able to produce SpA-gamma-IFN in the absence of CD8+ or OKT8+ (T8: suppressor/cytotoxic) or B-cells. PBL pre-incubated with SpA for more than 72 h inhibited gamma-IFN production by autologous fresh PBL; this inhibition segregated with the T8 subpopulation and was not due to cytotoxicity. SpA-gamma-IFN titers increased markedly when CD3+ or OKT3+ (T3) or T4 cells were incubated with a small number (2-10%) of adherent monocytes, whereas larger numbers (greater than 20%) decreased the yield of SpA-gamma-IFN. This decreased yield was probably mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) of monocyte origin: the presence of PGE2 was demonstrable in these cultures by radioimmunoassay, and the addition of indomethacin reversed the inhibitory effect of large numbers of monocytes; further, treatment of T-cells with exogenous PGE2 also led to an inhibition of SpA-gamma-IFN. Ibuprofen and aspirin also had an effect comparable to indomethacin on SpA-gamma-IFN production. These observations indicate that the production of SpA-gamma-IFN is by T4 lymphocytes, is enhanced by limited numbers of accessory cells (monocytes), and is also regulated by T8 cells via monocyte PGE2. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess the theoretical cost of the medical treatment of asthma in a group of young adults who are free from any other disease; the study lasted for one year of follow up and the treatment was given in the public hospital service. Four particular situations are identified corresponding to four stages of severity of the disease and each of these stages was given a treatment selected as the usual therapeutic regime given in a respiratory service in a public hospital. The first stage was to suit patients suffering from quarterly paroxysmal crises which tended to resolve quickly after a few days of treatment. The second stage was more severe involving patients suffering from monthly paroxysmal attacks and for whom maintenance treatment was necessary. The third stage was for those with unstable asthma with twice monthly asthmatic crises, frequent hospitalisation and continuous treatment between the attacks. In the fourth stage the patients were suffering from continuous dyspnoea which required inpatient hospital care and also intensive care. In all these cases the asthmatic disorder is burdensome both for the patient and for society, a fact which should be appreciated both by doctors and by decision makers in public health.

The average wait for the earliest appointment was 5 days for optometrists and 20 days for ophthalmologists. Weekend and evening appointments were also more obtainable among optometrists. The study did not determine what tests were included in the routine examination of each practitioner. Optometrists are licensed to use diagnostic drugs in all 50 States and prescribe therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ocular diseases in 25 States. Legislation that would update State laws permitting doctors of optometry to prescribe and use pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of eye diseases has been introduced in many of the remaining States. Supporters of bills permitting therapeutic pharmaceutical optometry contend that these changes would ensure the availability of quality eye care at significant savings, since optometric fees are generally lower than ophthalmological fees. In addition, it has been argued that optometrists are equitably distributed geographically and are more likely to have weekend and evening office hours, thus enabling increased patient access to eye care. When considering cost-effectiveness and accessibility, this study may provide information to those States considering changes in the scope of optometric licensure. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Significant enhancement of DR antigen expression (P = 0.01), with values similar to those of normal monocytes, occurred in patient monocytes preincubated at 37 degrees C overnight, but not in monocytes preincubated at 4 degrees C. This suggested that a temperature-dependent metabolic process is required to enhance antigen expression. The addition of cycloheximide totally inhibited the enhancement of DR antigen density. Incubation of monocytes with exogenous prostaglandin E2 (10(-5)M final concentration) caused a reduction of DR densities on control and on RA monocytes, although this decrease was more marked in the controls. Addition of indomethacin did not affect DR antigen levels on control monocytes, but greatly enhanced the expression of DR antigens on RA monocytes. When HLA-DR antigen levels were estimated in detergent-solubilized membrane preparations, monocytes from patients with active RA demonstrated normal-to-increased densities compared with control monocytes. Thus, although RA monocytes possess a normal ability to synthesize DR molecules, surface expression of these molecules is inhibited; this inhibition may be mediated by prostaglandin E2 acting as a negative suppressive signal. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Catheters were inserted into both femoral veins. More than one site in the superior and inferior vena cava was sampled before reaching the inferior petrosal sinuses. Blood samples for ACTH and beta-endorphin were gently aspirated from both petrosal sinuses and from a peripheral vein simultaneously. Blood was drawn at 0, 5, 10 and 15 min after oCRH injection. Seventeen of 22 patients showed an ipsilateral to peripheral vein ratio higher than 1.5, and 12 patients showed a lateralization of ACTH levels after oCRH stimulation. Seventeen patients underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. Nine patients had a pituitary adenoma at the expected side; 1 at the contralateral side, while in 2 it was central. Three of 4 patients in whom the ipsilateral/peripheral ratio was less than 1.5 had the highest ACTH levels at the superior or inferior vena cava, not responsive to oCRH stimulation. One of these had a mediastinal and one a pulmonary mass. The third one, with an occult ectopic source, is still under investigation. At immunohistochemical and biological in vitro studies, both tumors were shown to secrete ACTH. In 13 patients in whom both beta-endorphin and ACTH measurements were performed, these hormones showed similar patterns of response. In conclusion, simultaneous bilateral petrosal sinus catheterization is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome as concerning pituitary and ectopic forms.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Funct., 15: 163-173). In the present experiment we investigated distribution, structure and properties of the stacks by conventional electronmicroscopy, lectin cytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. The size and number of stacks were variable depending on their intracellular localization; short stacks with 2-4 parallel cisterns predominate in the perikaryon, long stacks with 4-15 cisterns in the proximal dendrite, and long stacks with 3-4 cisterns in the distal dendrites. The flattened cisterns bind with concanavalin A but not with wheat-germ agglutinin and may contain KDEL proteins loaded with Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu at their C-terminin in their lumens, indicating that the cisterns are derived from ER membranes. The electron dense materials sandwiched between the cisternal membranes are composed of small particles, short cylindrical in shape and approximately 20 nm in diameter, and markedly labeled with anti InsP3R antibody. We suggest that they correspond to the tetramer of the InsP3R or their related molecules. It is not clear whether the stacks of flattened cisterns exist per se in the Purkinje cells or smooth ER existing in singlet in vivo in the Purkinje cells forms stacks during fixation. It is strongly suggested, however, that the smooth ER membranes covered by the InsP3R or their related molecules can easily interact and stack each other in the Purkinje cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It is available in both oral and parenteral dosage forms. The primary target of quinolone activity appears to be the bacterial DNA gyrase enzyme, which is a member of the class of type II topoisomerases. Bacterial do not acquire resistance to fluoroquinolones through mechanisms that are plasmid or R-factor mediated and, additionally, the quinolones do not appear to be vulnerable to degradation by bacterial inactivating mechanisms. Rather, bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin occurs either through chromosomal mutation in the target enzyme DNA gyrase or through mutations that alter drug permeability into the bacterial cell. Ciprofloxacin and the fluoroquinolones in general are no more likely to select resistant mutant than are aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin displays in vitro activity against most Gram-negative and many Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, many of which are resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. This finding is of considerable potential clinical significance. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microbiological agar diffusion assays have been routinely used to quantify ciprofloxacin concentrations in biological fluids. Both methods are reproducible and accurate for serum but HPLC is recommended for other specimens because of the presence of microbiologically active metabolites. Absorption after oral administration is rapid and can be satisfactorily described as a zero-order process; peak serum ciprofloxacin concentrations (Cmax) are reached in approximately 1 to 2 hours. Concomitant administration of food does not cause clinically significant impairment of absorption and may be helpful in minimising gastric distress caused by the drug. A linear relationship between serum ciprofloxacin concentrations and the dose administered either orally or intravenously has been reported. The absolute bioavailability of ciprofloxacin is approximately 70%. The volume of distribution is large with a steady-state range after oral or intravenous dosing of 1.74 to 5.0 L/kg reflecting penetration of the drug into most tissues. Nonrenal clearance accounts for approximately 33% of the elimination of ciprofloxacin; to date, 4 metabolites have been identified. A first-pass effect has been reported but is thought to be clinically unimportant. Faecal recovery of ciprofloxacin accounts for approximately 15% of an intravenous dose. Nonrenal elimination includes metabolic degradation, biliary excretion and transluminal secretion across the enteric mucosa. Glomerular filtration and tubular secretion account for approximately 66% of the total serum clearance. The terminal disposition half-life (t1/2) is about 3 to 4 hours.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Functional alterations in the donor artery, occurring after the implantation of the graft, have been considered as having an arresting effect on the progress of the occlusive disease, which explains the favorable long-term results. However, until now, the intrinsic mechanism of this phenomenon has remained unexplained. Little attention has been devoted to the evaluation of the natural history of the donor artery. To achieve this purpose, 18 patients previously operated on for femorofemoral bypass, with a normal patent graft, were submitted to angiographic evaluation, from 8 to 57 months after the operation (mean 22 months). The angiograms were compared with the preoperative films to assess the progress of the occlusive disease in the donor artery. A slight but significant dilatation of the proximal donor arterial segment was documented in every case, affecting the external iliac and common femoral arteries. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is discussed. It may be related to decreased peripheral resistance and increased blood flow occurring in the donor arterial segment, reported after the implantation of the shunt. This dilatation of the donor artery may have a compensatory effect for local atherosclerotic stenosis, thereby explaining the favorably long duration of the femorofemoral bypasses, which has been emphasized since the early days of extraanatomic revascularization. A similar phenomenon may occur in the vessels of the upper extremity, after axillofemoral revascularization. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The importance of this task arises from the ubiquity of genotoxic compounds in the environment and the need to identify the sources of contamination so that efforts aimed at control and minimization can be implemented. Of even greater significance is the immediate concern for the welfare of human health and the environment. Subheadings of this document include a description of the genetic bioassays that have been used to test industrial wastes, a compendium of methods commonly used to prepare crude waste samples for bioassay, and a review of the genetic toxicity of wastes and effluents. Wastes and effluents have been grouped according to industrial source. Major categories include chemical and allied products, pulp and paper manufacturing, defense and munitions, petroleum refining, primary metal industries, and miscellaneous industrial manufacturers. Within each industrial category, a synopsis of individual genetic toxicity studies is presented, followed by an interpretation of results on a comprehensive, industry-wide basis. In this evaluation, a discussion of the types and extent of genotoxic damage caused by a particular set of wastes is presented, and potential sources of genotoxic activity are identified. Concluding the document is a commentary, which discloses potential shortcomings in the way in which current legislation protects human heath and the environment from the release of genotoxic substances via industrial wastes and effluents. It also provides an assessment of the genotoxic burden that industrial wastes place on the environment. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After correction for skewness, evidence in favor of two commingled distributions was found for SBP in the combined data (parents and offspring) and in parents, but not in offspring. Segregation analysis (using the computer program POINTER) suggested that a multifactorial contribution to all three phenotypes was greater in offspring than in parents, which could be the result of either polygenic or shared environmental components relevant to sibships, or both. Statistical evidence was found for a major effect on SBP. However, Mendelian transmission of the major effect was rejected, and no transmission of the major effect (equal tau's) was not. This is just the opposite to what would be expected if the major effect was due to a major gene, and it would ordinarily be considered as sufficient evidence to refute a major gene effect on SBP. However, the commingling in parents but not in offspring (who are all below 26 years of age), and the finding of equal transmission probabilities (nearly equal to 1), are compatible with an alternative interpretation. It is possible that there is a real major gene effect on SBP but that the genotype for elevated SBP has not yet expressed itself in the offspring as they have not yet gone through the risk period. Accordingly, this possibility needs to be evaluated further in additional studies involving older offspring. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to: (1) characterize the chemical nature of the substance P-like immunoreactivity in the sympathetic preganglionic neuropil; and (2) quantify the relative contributions of brain stem, primary sensory and intraspinal neurons to the substance P content within the sympathetic preganglionic neuropil. Electron microscopic observations on the localization of substance P-like immunoreactivity within the preganglionic neuropil caudal to complete thoracic spinal cord transections are also reported. High-performance liquid chromatographic analyses demonstrate that pigeon substance P-like immunoreactivity co-migrates with synthetic substance P, suggesting that the substance P-like material is authentic substance P content within the sympathetic preganglionic neuropil. Electron microscopic observations on the localization of substance P-like immunoreactivity within the preganglionic neuropil caudal to complete preganglionic cell column (inclusive of intermediate spinal laminae V and VII as well as preganglionic neurons located within nucleus intercalatus spinalis); (2) cutting the dorsal rootlets entering the last cervical (C14) and first two thoracic (T1, T2) spinal segments resulted in massive depletion of substance P content in dorsal horn of T1, but no detectable losses within the preganglionic cell column or ventral horn of T1; and (3) total mid-thoracic (T3-4) spinal cord transection significantly depleted the substance P content in the preganglionic cell column (T3-4) as well as in the dorsal (T1-4) and ventral horns (T2-4). Ultrastructural examination of the sympathetic preganglionic neuropil caudal to spinal transections (survival times of 3-14 days) revealed the presence of numerous, intact, normal appearing substance P-like immunoreactive terminals. Immunolabeled terminals formed asymmetric contacts on medium-sized and small caliber dendrites. Extensive degeneration was evident in this material as well. The ultrastructural features of degenerating processes were distinctive and quite dissimilar in appearance from those exhibiting substance P-like immunoreactive staining. No evidence for damage-induced sequestration of substance P-like material into glial elements was found.

We describe the purification and characterization of an abundant alpha-class GST from this tissue that has not been identified previously because of its failure to bind to S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose 6B (S-hexG-Ag). This enzyme has been affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose 6B (GSH-Ag) and was obtained in a highly purified form by employing S-hexG-Ag to remove the bulk of GST before chromatography on GSH-Ag. The purified GST eluted from GSH-Ag was found to exhibit marked peroxidase and delta 5-ketosteroid isomerase activities (19.2 and 1.67 U/mg respectively). The bovine enzyme also showed high GST activity towards 4-hydroxynonenal (5.09 U/mg). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed that the bovine GST contains two distinct polypeptides, one with an Mr of 25,900 and the other with an Mr of 26,500. An abundant alpha-class GST was also purified from human adrenal cortex that possessed properties which were similar to the bovine alpha-class GST described above; however, unlike the bovine enzyme, the corresponding human alpha-class GST bound to S-hexG-Ag. As with the bovine enzyme, the purified human GST displayed marked peroxidase and isomerase activities (27 and 4.02 U/mg respectively). Further analysis on SDS-PAGE (Mr 25,800) and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography established that this abundant alpha-class GST in human adrenal cortex is equivalent to the human liver GST B1B1 enzyme. As both human and bovine adrenal cortex contain high levels of alpha-class GST with similar catalytic properties, we discuss the possible functions of these enzymes in this tissue. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In isolated perfused rabbit lungs we measured the effect of lung volume, left atrial pressure (Pla), and blood flow on capillary transit time. At constant blood flow and constant transpulmonary pressure, a bolus of fluorescent dye was injected into the pulmonary artery and the passage of the dye through the subpleural microcirculation was recorded via the video microscope on videotape. During playback of the video signals, the light emitted from an arteriole and adjacent venule was measured using a video photoanalyzer. Capillary transit time was the difference between the mean time values of the arteriolar and venular dye dilution curves. We measured capillary transit time in three groups of lungs. In group 1, with airway pressure (Paw) at 5 cmH2O, transit time was measured at blood flow of approximately 80, approximately 40, and approximately 20 ml.min-1.kg-1. At each blood flow level, Pla was varied from 0 (Pla less than Paw, zone 2) to 11 cmH2O (Pla greater than Paw, zone 3). In group 2, at constant Paw of 15 cmH2O, Pla was varied from 0 (zone 2) to 22 cmH2O (zone 3) at the same three blood flow levels. In group 3, at each of the three blood flow levels, Paw was varied from 5 to 15 cmH2O while Pla was maintained at 0 cmH2O (zone 2).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It induced skeletal muscle damage, anticoagulant effects and edema in the foot pad. The toxin had an intravenous LD50 of 95 micrograms/16-18 g mouse body wt and an intraventricular LD50 of 0.42 micrograms/16-18 g mouse body wt. Upon intramuscular and intravenous injections, the toxin induced a prominent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels; only the CK-MM isozyme increased markedly. The toxin induced CK and creatine release from skeletal muscle incubated in vitro. The rate of efflux of creatine was higher than that of CK, although both markers were partially released as early as 15 min after incubation. The toxin also induced elevation of serum levels of lactic dehydrogenase isozymes. However, histological examination of skeletal muscle, kidneys, heart and lungs revealed cell damage only in skeletal muscle. The toxin was not cytotoxic to erythrocytes, lymphocytes or macrophages. In addition, it did not induce a mitogenic response on lymphocytes. In the absence of albumin in the medium, there was no significant difference between myotoxic activities in Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing bathing solutions. However, when albumin was added, there was a significantly higher myotoxic effect in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, although phospholipolytic activity of the toxin plays a role in muscle damage when albumin is present, the toxin induces muscle damage even when phospholipase A activity is inhibited. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Pyruvate inhibits flavocytochrome b2, but the catalytic competence of pyruvate-ligated FSQ in intramolecular electron transfer to heme is unclear; one kinetic study suggested pyruvate prevented this reaction [Tegoni, M, Janot J.-M., & Labeyrie, F. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 190, 329-342], while laser flash photolysis indicated pyruvate was essential [Walker, M. C., & Tollin, G. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 5546-5555]. To address this problem, wild-type (WT) and mutant (L36I) flavocytochromes b2 have been expressed in Escherichia coli. Both forms incorporated heme and FMN prosthetic groups and were catalytically active. The mutation L36I was a conservative substitution within the heme-binding crevice and was designed to alter the midpoint potential (Em) of the heme to alter the pyruvate-FSQ/heme equilibrium. Potentiometric titrations yielded Em values (pH 7.0, 25 degrees C) of +8 and -28 mV for WT and L36I forms, respectively. The FMN midpoint potentials in the absence of pyruvate (-58 mV, n = 2) were identical within experimental error in WT and L36I species and were also identical (+5 mV, n = 1) in the presence of pyruvate. These results indicated the absence of redox cooperativity between FMN and heme.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The lack of such scales in French, led us to translate and validate an existing knowledge scale for diabetic children, the Test of Diabetes Knowledge (TDK) (Johnson et al.). After several translations and back translations, the 33 item scale was submitted to the staff members of a pediatric diabetology unit, to establish its content validity. An assessment the questionnaire was performed in a group of 49 children, aged 7.9 to 12.8 years. The mean duration of diabetes was 4.6 +/- 2.9 years and their scholastic level varied from 1st to 6th grades. Time spent in filling out the questionnaires was 12 to 25 minutes. Few missing values were noted. The reliability of the scale was excellent as shown by Cronbach's alpha coefficient: 0.83 for the overall scale, 0.72 for the general knowledge subscale (20 items) and 0.70 for the problem solving subscale (13 items). The level of correct responses was correlated with age and scholastic level (p < 0.0001), but not with sex, duration of diabetes, or HbA1c levels. This study shows that the French version of the TDK is a valid and reliable tool for measuring the level of knowledge in children and adolescents with diabetes. This scale provides the researcher and clinician with a tool that facilitates the performance of an educational diagnosis and the evaluation of educational programs based on the transmission knowledge. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Cylindrical specimens taken from the upper tibial epiphysis of autopsy knees were tested non-destructively by cyclic compression to 0.8% strain under different conditions. Fixation of the specimens to the test columns by a thin layer of bone cement increased the stiffness by 40% and reduced the energy dissipation to 67% of those measured under unconstrained conditions (p less than 0.001). The thin cement layer alone increased the stiffness 19% and reduced energy dissipation to 86% (n.s.). When the machine was equipped with polished steel columns coated by a film of low-viscous oil, both the stiffness and the energy dissipation were reduced to 93% of those measured under standard conditions (p less than 0.005). Trabecular bone specimens tested side-constrained by the surrounding trabecular bone (in situ) showed a 19% larger stiffness than that measured during later testing of the corresponding machined specimens (p less than 0.005) whereas the energy dissipation was not altered significantly.

Sixteen (16%) in the aortic and 24 (25%) in the mitral position were associated with clinical signs of regurgitation. A phased array system (Hewlett-Packard A77020A) with a 2.5 MHz duplex and 1.9 MHz continuous wave transducer was used. Colour flow mapping showed trivial transvalvar regurgitation in 23 (53%) metal aortic prosthesis, and only nine (20%) metal mitral prostheses. This difference was probably attributable to shielding of the left atrium by the metal components. Colour mapping confirmed abnormal regurgitation in all aortic prostheses with early diastolic numbers, but regurgitation was also shown in 25 (29%) with no diastolic murmur. Abnormal mitral regurgitation was found in 13 (54%) patients with a pansystolic murmur, but also in six (8%) with no systolic murmur. Two patients, thought on clinical grounds to have mild mitral regurgitation, had unexpectedly large jets on colour flow mapping. About one in three prostheses had paraprosthetic leaks, 65 (79%) of which were small with a jet area less than 20% of the area of the receiving chamber. The development of new paraprosthetic leaks led to the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis in two patients. In eight patients regurgitation was first diagnosed with continuous wave Doppler, but was afterwards shown with colour mapping and in a further 10 regurgitation could only be shown by continuous wave Doppler. Colour flow mapping was less sensitive than continuous wave Doppler in detecting regurgitation,but seemed able to distinguish normal transvalvar from paraprosthetic regurgitation. Further studies in the natural course of paraprosthetic leaks and a comparison of the transoesophageal and transthoracic approaches in the assessment of mitral prostheses are needed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the rat AdoMetDC gene consists of 8 exons which encode a protein identical to that inferred by a rat AdoMetDC cDNA sequence. The exons range in length from 43 to 1964 base pairs spanning 15672 bases of chromosomal DNA. All of the exon/intron junctions were found to conform to the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. Exon 8 corresponds to the 3' noncoding region of the 2 species of AdoMetDC mRNA which are formed by alternative utilization of 2 polyadenylation signals separated from each other by 1272 nucleotides. The transcription initiation site was located by S1 nuclease protection and by primer extension analysis, -325 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. The promoter region of the rat AdoMetDC gene contains a TATA box at -29 base pairs. No typical GC or CAAT boxes are located in the promoter, but six GC boxes and several putative binding sites for both tissue-specific and non-specific transcription factors are found in the proximal part of intron 1. Southern blot analyses reveal a complex hybridization pattern suggesting that there are multiple copies of the AdoMetDC gene in the rat genome. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

To improve the yield of cells with higher autologous and lower nonspecific cytotoxicity, interleukin-4 (IL-4) was added to high (1,000 U/ml)- and low (20 U/ml)-dose IL-2 and compared to cultures grown without IL-4 for proliferation, phenotype, and cytotoxicity against targets including autologous and allogeneic tumors. When compared to culture in IL-2 alone, the addition of IL-4 improved overall expansion in both high-dose (mean fold expansion of 2,061 vs. 1,087) and low-dose (mean fold expansion of 1,904 vs. 262) IL-2. Enhancement of TIL proliferation was dependent on the timing of IL-4 addition to the culture; augmented growth occurred only when IL-4 was added with or following activation by IL-2. The phenotype consisted primarily of CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes with a reciprocal reduction in CD56+/CD16+ cells. Finally, there was a significant reduction in nonspecific cytotoxicity against K-562, M-14, and allogeneic tumor targets, but no significant change against autologous tumor. We conclude that IL-4 has an important regulatory effect on the expansion of renal cell carcinoma TILs in IL-2 by the promoting growth of CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes and inhibiting the growth and nonspecific cytotoxicity associated with LAK-like CD16+/CD56+ cells.

The effect of five S-nitrosothiols, and of the stereoisomers of NG-hydroxy-arginine (HOARG), were investigated on the mouse anococcygeus. 2. All five S-nitrosothiols produced concentration-related (0.1-100 microM) relaxations of carbachol (50 microM)-induced tone; the order of potency was S-nitroso-L-cysteine (CYSNO) > S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) > S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) > S-nitrosocoenzyme A (CoASNO) > S-nitroso-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NACNO). The relaxations were unaffected by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NG-nitro-arginine (10 microM) (L-NOARG). 3. Cold-storage of the tissue for 72 h resulted in loss of sympathetic and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve function. NOS activity in the tissue was reduced by 97%. Despite this, relaxations induced by the S-nitrosothiols were unaffected. 4. Haemoglobin (50 microM) attenuated relaxations induced by NO and the S-nitrosothiols, although responses to 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine were unaffected. N-methyl-hydroxylamine (2 mM) which has been shown previously to produce selective inhibition of NANC and nitrovasodilator responses in this tissue, also reduced responses to all S-nitrosothiols. 5. Hydroquinone (100 microM) greatly reduced relaxations to CYSNO (by 88%) but had no effect on those to SNAP, GSNO, CoASNO or NACNO. Since hydroquinone does not reduce responses to NANC stimulation, CYSNO is unlikely to be the NANC transmitter. 6. L-HOARG by itself (up to 100 microM) had no significant effect on carbachol-induced tone or on NANC (10 Hz; 10 strain every 100 s) relaxations. However, it produced reversal of the inhibitory effects of L-NOARG (10;pM), being only slightly less potent than L-arginine. D-HOARG was without effect.L-HOARG had no effect on relaxations induced by 1.51iM NO.7. The results show that S-nitrosothiols are potent relaxants of the mouse anococcygeus; they act directly on the smooth muscle with a mechanism similar to NO and other nitrovasodilators. In addition,the results are consistent with L-HOARG being an intermediate in the biosynthesis of NO from L-arginine, although there is no evidence for it acting to stabilize NO extracellularly. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Blood samples were collected at delivery from the umbilical artery of all preterm infants with a gestational age less than 36 weeks for determination of pH and catecholamine levels (noradrenaline and adrenaline). Amongst non-asphyxiated infants only, cord pH greater than 7.25 and/or Apgar score greater than 7 at five minutes, catecholamine levels were compared between the 10 infants who developed transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) and 13 controls of a similar gestational age range (31-35 weeks) who developed no respiratory distress in the neonatal period. Infants who developed TTN were more often delivered without labour, 8 of 10 compared to 2 of 13 controls (p less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in adrenaline levels between the two groups. Noradrenaline levels, however, were significantly lower in the infants who developed TTN, being a median of 3.1 nmol/l (range 1.07-5.85 nmol/l) compared to a median of 6.4 nmol/l (range 2.38-22.83) in the controls (p less than 0.01). Infants who were delivered following labour had significantly elevated noradrenaline levels compared those delivered without labour (elective delivery) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that low noradrenaline levels in preterm infants may explain the association in this group of TTN and \"elective\" delivery. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Furthermore, thymoma-associated lymphocytes were studied with monoclonal antibodies directed against T-lymphocyte differentiation antigens (CD1a, CD3, T-cell antigen receptor). Only four of the 14 thymomas could be classified into either medullary or cortical type thymoma based on the immunophenotype of epithelial cells. Ten cases escaped immunophenotypical classification due to co-expression of medullary and cortical antigens by the tumour cells. This aberration from the normal phenotype might indicate the failure of differentiation of such tumours. The immunophenotype of the associated lymphocytes, on the other hand, made it possible to classify the tumours as cortical (5 cases), mixed (2) and medullary (3) thymomas. Four thymomas escaped this classification scheme due to the absence of lymphocytes (2) or to a hybrid immunophenotype (2). Nevertheless, thymocytes of cortical type clearly predominated and were seen in all thymomas with associated lymphocytes. This feature may constitute a good diagnostic tool in differential diagnosis since, in 28 mediastinal or extramediastinal metastasis of tumours not derived from thymic epithelium and associated with various numbers of lymphocytes, none of them were found to contain CD1a positive lymphocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Moreover, PAF can increase glomerular permeability to proteins and induce mesangial contraction. Thus PAF might be a good candidate as a mediator of glomerular damage. However the in vivo evidence that PAF might cause glomerular injury is lacking. To evaluate if PAF has a major role in promoting glomerular inflammatory reaction and fibrin deposition, we studied the effect of a molecule, L-652,731, which blocks the PAF receptor, on the evolution of an experimental model of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis (GN). GN was initiated by sheep-anti-rabbit nephrotoxic serum. A proliferative GN regularly occurred in which heavy proteinuria, intra and extracapillary proliferation of resident and inflammatory cells and fibrin deposition in Bowman's capsule were the prominent findings. Our results showed that the PAF receptor antagonist reduces the glomerular damage in anti-GBM GN, supporting the hypothesis that PAF is indeed a mediator of glomerular inflammatory reaction. PAF receptor blocking prevented renal function deterioration in the early phase of the disease, probably preserving glomerular hemodynamics. In the delayed phase of the disease the PAF receptor antagonist reduced proteinuria and prevented renal function deterioration and fibrin deposition. These effects appear to be mediated by an inhibitory action of PAF receptor blocking on macrophage accumulation and activation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The patients, aged 33.8 +/- 5.5 years, were burnt over 60 +/- 10% of body surface area, with a UBS score of 228 +/- 43. The measurements were obtained every six hours after insertion of the catheter. Fluid load was determined with Evans' formula, and modified according to the haemodynamic data. Catecholamines were introduced when this and a trial of fluid loading with 5 ml.kg-1 of macromolecules during a 20 min period had failed, starting with dobutamine or dopamine, followed by adrenaline as required. During the first hours after the injury, circulatory shock was partly linked to hypovolaemia: mean arterial pressure was 60.1 +/- 7.8 mmHg, right auricular pressure 4.5 +/- 2 mmHg, pulmonary wedge pressure 4.7 +/- 2 mmHg, cardiac index 3.5 +/- 0.8 l.min-1 x m-2. However, during the second and third days, cardiac output increased, with a cardiac index at 4.7 +/- 0.6 l.min-1 x m-2 and 5.2 +/- 0.2 l.min-1 x m-2 respectively, and arterial vascular resistances were decreased (536 +/- 125 dyn.s.cm-5). These data suggest a specific haemodynamic profile in severe burn patients which justifies invasive monitoring, and the use of catecholamines, in those patients that do not respond to fluid loading. The link between these data and the concomitant metabolic disturbances due to the burn injury has not yet been established. The increase in cardiac index could be related to the inflammatory response.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Challenge experiments using heparin, restriction endonucleases, and competing promoter DNA under various conditions showed that, at several promoters, complexes with B. subtilis RNA polymerase formed in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates were unstable. These complexes produced DNase I footprints that were less extended than those produced by the E. coli enzyme at the same promoters. Further, in the presence of certain combinations of nucleoside triphosphates, conditions that allow production of abortive oligonucleotides, these B. subtilis RNA polymerase complexes remained dissociable. Thus, at these promoters, the B. subtilis enzyme interacted with the DNA and reached a catalytically active initial transcribing complex without becoming committed to the template. At these same promoters, E. coli RNA polymerase formed stable open complexes before forming any phosphodiester bonds. B. subtilis initial transcribing complexes also remained sensitive to the drug rifampicin until a later stage in the initiation process than did the corresponding E. coli complexes. At one promoter, B. subtilis E sigma A and E. coli E sigma 70 behaved similarly, forming stable open complexes in the absence of any nucleoside triphosphates. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Thrombin (0.4 unit/ml) caused a rapid cell acidification followed by a slow, amiloride-inhibitable alkalinization (0.10-0.14 delta pHi above base line). In protein kinase C down-regulated cells (exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 or 72 h), the delta pHi induced by thrombin was only partially attenuated. This protein kinase C-independent activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger was blocked by pertussis toxin (islet activating protein (IAP)), reducing delta pHi by 50%. IAP did not directly inhibit Na+/H+ exchange activity as assessed by the response to intracellular acid loading. Thrombin also stimulated arachidonic acid release by 2.5 fold and inositol trisphosphate release by 6.2 fold. IAP inhibited both of these activities by 50-60%. Intracellular Ca2+ chelation with 120 microM quin2 prevented the thrombin-induced Ca2+ spike, inhibited thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release by 75%, and inhibited thrombin-induced activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in protein kinase C-deficient cells by 65%. Increased intracellular [Ca2+] alone was not sufficient to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger, since ionomycin (0.3-1.5 microM) failed to elevate cell pH significantly. 10 microM indomethacin inhibited thrombin-induced delta pHi in both control and protein kinase C down-regulated cells by 30-50%. Thus, thrombin can activate the Na+/H+ exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells by a Ca2+-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway which does not involve protein kinase C. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Heparin-treated rats had low plasma aldosterone levels, high plasma renin activity and plasma AII levels, and normal plasma corticosterone level 6 weeks after the treatment (1500 IU/kg, twice daily). Basal aldosterone production, when corrected to a uniform number of cells per group, was similar in the cells from heparin- and vehicle-treated rats. The cells from heparin-treated rats had a less sensitive and lower response of aldosterone production to AII; an increase by 4 orders of magnitude in the threshold dose for AII and a decrease in the maximum AII-stimulated level. The maximum AII-stimulated levels, but not the basal levels, of pregnenolone, corticosterone and 18-OHB production were low in the cells from heparin-treated rats. ACTH caused a similar stimulatory effect on aldosterone production in the cells from heparin- and vehicle-treated rats. The cells from heparin-treated rats had a less sensitive and lower response of aldosterone production to potassium; an increase by one order of magnitude in the threshold dose for potassium and a decrease in the maximum potassium-stimulated level, presumably because of the glomerulosa hyporesponsiveness to AII. These results suggest that our heparin-treated rats have selective impairment of adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, involving the specific receptors and the aldosterone biosynthesis, to AII. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Using a short DQ beta cDNA probe, a DQ beta allelic series was defined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with the restriction endonuclease TaqI. This DQ beta allelic series correlates with, and defines splits of, the HLA-DQ serological specificities DQw1 (DQ beta 1a and DQ beta 1b RFLPs), DQw2 (DQ beta 2a and DQ beta 2b RFLPs) and DQw3 (DQ beta 3a and DQ beta 3b RFLPs). By sequential use of a short DQ alpha cDNA probe a second, DQ alpha allelic series is defined by RFLP. This series correlates to a lesser extent than DQ beta RFLPs with the HLA-DQ serological specificities. Thus, two DQ alpha RFLPs correlate with a single DQ serotype (DQ alpha 1a and DQ alpha 1c with DQw1), but three DQ alpha RFLPs correlate with more than one DQ serotype (DQ alpha 1b with DQw1 and DQw3; DQ alpha 2 with DQw2 and DQw3; DQ alpha 3 with DQw2 and DQw3). Individual DQ beta and DQ alpha RFLP subtypes appear to correlate with single, or associated HLA-DR specificities. Specific combinations of DQ beta with DQ alpha RFLPs also correlate with HLA-Dw splits of DR2 and DRw6. A system for HLA-DNA typing is described, which uses RFLP patterns generated by sequential hybridization of TaqI-digested DNAs with short DR beta, DQ beta and DQ alpha cDNA probes. The DQ beta and DQ alpha probes not only identify the DQ allele, but because of linkage disequilibrium with DR, help to assign the DR allele, which may not always be identified with a DR beta probe alone. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The rate of metabolism of glucose to lactate has been measured in a number of non-vascularly perfused preparations of rat jejunum in vitro. The glucose and lactate metabolism was measured simultaneously and under conditions such that the uptake of glucose and the appearance of lactate were linearly related to time. 2. It is found that there is no difference between the rates at which rings of rat jejunum utilize glucose during the first 45 min of anaerobic or aerobic incubation. During the first 15 min of incubation between 60-70% of the metabolized glucose was converted to lactate under aerobic conditions; this value increased to 80-90% during the subsequent 30 min. During the period 0-15 min of incubation, lactate production was found to be higher under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions but after this initial period the rate of lactate production was the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 3. For segments of rat jejunum, maintained in vitro by the recirculation of nutrient fluid through the intestinal lumen, neither the rate of production of lactate, nor the utilization of glucose, was stimulated if the preparation was maintained under anaerobic rather than aerobic conditions. The direct delivery of gas into the intestinal lumen in the form of a stream of bubbles (segmented circulation) reduced both the utilization of glucose and the production of lactate under aerobic conditions. However, not effect on glucose metabolism was observed under anaerobic conditions. The finding of a Pasteur effect with the segmented-circulated preparation, but not with the simple recirculated preparation, is associated with lower rate of aerobic lactate production in the former preparation. Reasons are given for supposing that under conditions of segmented circulation, the luminal compartment is better stirred, thereby increasing access of O2 to the tissue. 4. A preparation of rat small intestine perfused through the vascular bed is described. With this preparation the rate of glucose utilization is significantly lower than that for recirculated preparations and the rate of lactate production is substantially less than that of the other preparations studied. 5. With the preparation perfused through the vascular bed, and with glucose, 10 mM, present only in the vascular medium the addition of erythrocytes to the vascular infusate causes a significant reduction in both glucose utilization and in the rate of lactate production. The addition of erythrocytes to produce an haematocrit of 40% (v/v) causes a greater reduction in glucose utilization and lactate production than is found for an haematrocrit of 15%. About 10% of the lactate produced appears in the luminal contents. With an haematocrit of 15%, the O2 consumption of the whole wall of the jejunum was found to be 6-4 mumole O2 g dry wt.-1 min-1, equivalent of a value for the Q02 of 8-6 mul. O2 mg druwy wt.-1 hr-1.

Maximal binding capacities [MBC; mean +/- SE fmol 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3)/mg DNA] in liver increased from values of 68 +/- 14 at 80 days gestation to 684 +/- 152 at term. Liver T3NR MBC in newborn and adult sheep were comparable to values in term fetuses. Liver T3NR binding affinities were similar in all animals, averaging 1.68 +/- 0.05 X 10(9) M-1. Brain T3NR MBC were comparable at all fetal ages studied (410 +/- 55 fmol T3/mg DNA), increasing to 1,517 +/- 315 fmol T3/mg DNA during the 1st postnatal week and returning to comparable fetal values (368 +/- 37 fmol T3/mg DNA) in the 3rd week after birth. Brain T3NR binding affinities were comparable in all animals studied (7.5 +/- 2.1 X 10(9) M-1), and the mean value was significantly greater than mean liver T3NR affinity. T3NR binding of T3 analogues in six term fetal animals were qualitatively similar for both brain and liver and showed T3 = triiodothyroacetic acid greater than thyroxine greater than reverse T3. Like T3 binding affinity, T3NR analogue binding affinities in brain tissue were five- to sevenfold greater than those in liver. Fetal hypothyroidism induced by thyroidectomy at either 99-107 or 129-132 days of gestation was not associated with changes in brain or liver T3NR binding characteristics.

The time-courses for alpha-MT in plasma and brain were followed together with the endogenous brain dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) contents. The elimination of alpha-MT from plasma and brain was markedly delayed after the high alpha-MT dose compared with the low dose. At 40 hours after the injection of 1.02 mmoles/kg of alpha-MT both plasma and brain levels were high, whereas no alpha-MT could be detected in plasma or brain at 16 hours after the lower dose. The brain catecholamines were decreased to very low values after the higher alpha-MT dose (DA 14% and NA 10% of controls at 8 and 24 hours respectively). There was no complete recuperation at 40 hours of any of the amines. After the lower alpha-MT dose, the DA concentration was back to control levels at 16 hours and NA at 12 hours. Between 16--40 hours after the high alpha-MT dose a majority of the rats showed prominent signs of sedation, weight loss and dehydration. No such signs were observed in rats receiving 0.407 mmoles/kg. During the first hour after the alpha-MT injection the declines of DA and NA respectively were almost identical for both alpha-MT doses. When the whole time-course (0--8 hours) after the high dose was considered, biphasic declines were obtained for both DA and NA, suggesting at least two different catecholamine pools. However, due to toxic effects after the high alpha-MT dose, turnover data have to be interpreted with caution. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In a recent study, greater specificity appeared to be shown when lorazepam was used as a training drug. The generality and limits of this finding were explored in the present set of experiments. The asymmetrical cross-generalization found in lorazepam- and pentobarbital-trained baboons was replicated in rats and was shown not to be a function of either lorazepam (0.1., 0.32, or 1.0 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (10 or 25 mg/kg) training dose (i.e., pentobarbital-trained rats responded on the drug lever in tests with lorazepam, but lorazepam-trained rats did not show comparable pentobarbital generalization). In the next experiment, groups of rats were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), triazolam (0.1 mg/kg), or diazepam (1.0 mg/kg). Generalization to both lorazepam and pentobarbital was shown by these rats. Finally after daily pentobarbital administration, lorazepam-trained rats made a sufficient number of responses after high pentobarbital doses to permit extension of the range of pentobarbital doses tested. Pentobarbital generalization increased, but still did not occur in all rats and was unreliable in successive tests in the same rats.

All tissue specimens had been treated for routine histopathology, i.e. fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. One of the antigens, MAM-6, appeared to be an important epithelial marker, present in all normal and neoplastic breast tissue samples, in about 80% of non-mammary normal tissues and in more than 90% of non-mammary epithelial tumours. It could never be detected in normal and neoplastic mesenchymal and neuroectodermal structures. Direct comparison with the distribution of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), Tissue Polypeptide Antigen (TPA) and keratin provided clear evidence that MAM-6 is different from these well known epithelial markers. MAM-3 proved to be an additional important marker exhibiting a characteristic distribution pattern in those epithelial tissues investigated. In contrast to MAM-6, it could never be detected in renal cell cancers and carcinomas of the prostate gland, thus allowing differential diagnosis on the basis of immunohistochemistry. MAM-5, known to be associated with lactoferrin, was mainly detectable in secretory organs and their tumours. In the group of breast tumours, its expression was mainly seen in lobular cancers.

In sections of these cells, fixed in situ and examined in the electron microscope, a discontinuous zone of cortical cytoplasm (5-4 nm wide), was found subjacent to the plasma membrane of the free surface. It was composed largely of 5-7 nm microfilaments distributed in an apparently irregular network and appeared to comprise a discrete zone separating the plasma membrane from the underlying endoplasm. Following incubation with cytodhalasin B (5 mug/ml), the configuration of the cells changed markedly. The perikaryal cytoplasm appeared to swell, while the cellular processes became attenuated and often terminated in flower-like tips. Although more discontinuous and somewhat less dense, the fine structure of the cortical cytoplasm appeared little affected by incubation with cytochalasin B for one hour. By 48 hours no zone of cortical cytoplasm was found. Subplasmalemmal microfilaments were no longer identifiable and endoplasmic organelles were found in direct contact with the plasma membrane of the free surface, which appeared to have collapsed onto the underlying endoplasm. The change in cell configuration resulting from exposure to cytochalasin B occurred at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C, suggesting a dependency on metabolic activity. It did not, however, appeared related directly to protein synthesis. Whereas incorporation of 3H-leucine was decreased to 46.9% and 62.9% of control values after one hour or two hours exposure to cytochalasin B, respectively, no change was found after 24 or 48 hours. It is suggested that the effect of cytochalasin B on cell form, which appeared not to be a direct effect on either protein synthesis or subplasmalemmal microfilaments, may represent a primary response of the cortical cytoplasmic matrix. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have studied, in primary cultures of rat astrocytes, a sequential interaction of two growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which may be relevant to the brain in these conditions. EGF is a strong mitogen and stimulator of 2 deoxyglucose (2 DG) transport with no effect on plating of cells, and FGF is a lesser mitogen and 2 DG uptake stimulator. However, when FGF is given to the cells as a pretreatment, FGF strongly inhibits the ability of EGF to stimulate both DNA synthesis and 2 DG uptake. The inhibition of EGF stimulation by FGF is across the EGF dose-response curve, present at high and low culture densities, and stable for at least 3 days. Specificity is indicated by lack of inhibition by PDGF pretreatment and much less inhibition of fetal calf serum-induced stimulations than EGF-induced stimulation. Cell counts confirmed that the FGF pretreatment also inhibits EGF stimulation of cell division. Because of FGF brain derivation and angiogenic and neurotropic functions, it may serve as a regulator of EGF-astrocyte interactions in processes such as development, gliomatous transformation, and neural regeneration. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Increasing postseparation plating density was significantly associated (p less than 0.001) with decreasing percentages of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) cells, increasing percentages of galactocerebroside (GC+) cells, and increasing percentages of nonstained cells. As the fetal calf serum content of growth medium was increased, the percentage of GFAP+ cells increased, and as the serum content was decreased, the percentage of GC+ cells increased. Evidence of minimal cell proliferation and the observation of PB cells that coexpressed GFAP and GC supported the conclusion that PB cells switched their phenotypic expression from GFAP+ in serum to GC+ in serum-free medium. PB cells exhibited plasticity in their phenotypic expression as cells grown for 9 d in serum-free medium were still responsive to the effects of serum, while cells grown for 6 d in serum were refractory to serum withdrawal. This research has demonstrated the plasticity of PB cells separated from polygonal astroglia as they expressed GFAP in the presence of serum and GC in serum-free medium. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Electrochemical stimulation (anodic D.C.) was applied at 11.30 h through stainless steel electrodes chronically implanted into different amygdaloid nuclei; medial (Men.), cortical (Con.), central (Cn.), or basolateral (Bln.). A plastic cannula inserted into the jugular vein was used for obtaining blood samples at different times of the experimental procedure. In rats on the day of proestrus, stimulation (100 micronA/30 sec) in the Bln. resulted in blockade of spontaneous ovulation and of the preovulatory LH release and that in the Cn. produced a delay in the hormone discharge. On the contrary, stimulation in the Men. was effective in advancing the time of the normal LH surge, while no change of the normal pattern occurred from the Con. Stimulation (100 micronA/60 sec) of ovariectomized estrogen primed rats applied in the Men. or the Con. induced LH release, while that in the Bln. or the Cn. had no effect. The release of LH by Men. stimulation and the blocking effect of Bln. showed a close relationship with the amount of current delivered. Lower thresholds were required for inhibition than for activation. The release of LH induced by stimulation in the Men. of ovariectomized estrogen primed rats occurred at the same time of the day whether the stimulus was applied at 8.30 h, 11.30 h or 14.00 h, indicating a modulatory effect of the amygdala. No changes in serum LH concentration were observed after stimulation of the Men. of castrated estrogen primed male rats or in the Bln. of ovariectomized non-primed rats. The present results indicate that the amygdala exerts a dual effect on the release of LH, the Bln. being inhibitory and the Men. and Con. facilitatory. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to study the organization of the extracellular matrix, the distribution of fibronectin was investigated immunohistochemically. Using the PAP technique and the indirect immunofluorescence method, paraffin sections of formaldehyde fixed tissue specimens of 25 tumours (12 benign fibrous histiocytomas, 12 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and 1 atypical fibroxanthoma) were studied. A pretreatment with hyaluronidase and proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pronase, pepsin) was performed to unmask the antigen. Best results were obtained with pronase E or, sometimes even better, by employing a combination of pronase E and hyaluronidase. Generally fibronectin could be demonstrated in the matrix substances of fibrohistiocytic tumours, but the immunohistochemical staining patterns of benign and malignant tumours differed. In benign fibrous histiocytomas, a regular distribution of fibronectin was found in cellular areas. Parallel to formation of collagen fibres, the reaction decreased and in dermatofibromas showing abundant hyalinized collagen the staining proved to be quite weak. In malignant fibrous histiocytomas, the immunostaining was very irregular. In cellular areas consisting of spindle cells, an intense reaction could be observed. Tumours with storiform or fascicular fields exhibit a delicate network of fibronectin encircling individual fibroblast-like cells. In the course of fibre formation, the matrix staining for fibronectin revealed a distribution similar but not identical with that obtained with the reticulin stain. Simultaneous to the occurrence of collagen fibre bundles, fibronectin decreased and in areas of hyalinization the staining was considerably diminished. In areas of undifferentiated small cells, in myxoid zones as well as foci of xanthoma cells, and in pleomorphic portions the immunostain was negative. The distribution in atypical fibroxanthoma is similar to that observed in storiform and pleomorphic variants of malignant fibrous histiocytomas. The results support the suggestion that fibronectin is the first sign of the typical basic pattern of fibrohistiocytic tumours preceding the formation of reticulin and collagen fibres. The expression of fibronectin on cell surfaces as well as in intercellular matrix may be closely related to the organization of the growth patterns of fibrohistiocytic tumours. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Based on the correspondence of these phosphopeptides with those identified in TH from rat pheochromocytoma cells, four phosphorylation sites (Ser8, Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40) were inferred. Field stimulation of the splanchnic nerves at either 1 or 10 Hz (300 pulses) increased 32P incorporation into TH. At 10 Hz, the phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser40 was increased, whereas at 1 Hz, Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40 phosphorylation was increased. Stimulation at either 1 or 10 Hz also increased the catalytic activity of TH, as measured in vitro (pH 7.2) at either 30 or 300 microM tetrahydrobiopterin. Nicotine (3 microM, 3 min) increased Ser19 phosphorylation, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (10 microM, 3 min) increased Ser40 phosphorylation, and muscarine (100 microM, 3 min) increased TH phosphorylation primarily at Ser19 and Ser31. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, but not nicotine or muscarine, mimicked the effects of field stimulation on TH activity. Thus, the regulation of rat adrenal medullary TH phosphorylation by nerve impulses is mediated by multiple first and second messenger systems, as previously shown for catecholamine secretion. However, different sets of second messengers are involved in the two processes. The action of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide as a secretagogue involves the mobilization of intracellular calcium, whereas its effects on TH phosphorylation are mediated by cyclic AMP. This latter effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and the consequent increase in Ser40 phosphorylation appear to be responsible for the rapid activation of TH by splanchnic nerve stimulation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cell envelope that had been obtained by sonication of the whole cells was extracted in 2% lithium dodecyl sulfate and then successively chromatographed with Sephacryl S-200 HR and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow. Two OMP fractions, OMP-I and OMP-II, were obtained, and their immunochemical properties and induction of specific antibodies were examined. The OMP-I preparation consisted of a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa and other moderate to minor proteins of 40.3, 51.4, 67, and 71.6 kDa, while the OMP-II preparation contained 14-, 15.5-, 27-, and 44-kDa proteins as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis. OMP-I was found to form hydrophilic diffusion pores by incorporation into artificial liposomes composed of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and dicetylphosphate, indicating that OMP-I exhibited significant porin activity. However, the liposomes containing heat-denatured OMP-I were scarcely active. Spontaneous and antigen-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM)-, IgG-, and IgA-secreting spot-forming cells (SFC) enzymatically dissociated into single-cell suspensions from chronically inflamed periapical tissues and were enumerated by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. In patients with radicular cysts or dental granulomas, the major isotype of spontaneous SFC was IgG. In radicular cysts, the OMP-II-specific IgG SFC represented 0.13% of the total IgG SFC, while the antigen-specific IgA or IgM SFC was not observed. It was also found that none of these mononuclear cells produced antibodies specific for OMP-I or lipopolysaccharide of P. endodontalis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Such mechanical disadvantage will lead clinically, in the stable patient, to the active recruitment of the accessory muscles of inspiration and to a pattern of rapid, shallow breathing that may be due to either peripheral (muscle) or central (neurogenic) influences thought to be linked to a critical tension-time index of the inspiratory muscles. This pattern appears to be all the more pronounced in the patient with acute respiratory failure and is frequently accompanied by disordered rib cage-abdominal movements. While these movements may reflect the muscles' attempts to stave off fatigue, they may also imply that if the imposed mechanical stress is unrelieved, muscle failure will ensue. In the laboratory, mechanical disadvantage is marked by diminished inspiratory mouth pressures. Because of wide scatter, a low mouth pressure beyond that which can be explained by hyperinflation alone should be confirmed by an assessment of Pesosniff or by the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure. Muscle endurance, also compromised in this condition, can be assessed indirectly by the measurement of MVV or MSVC, or more directly by an invasive assessment of the tension-time index and endurance time of the diaphragm or noninvasively by the Endurance Index of McKenzie and Gandevia. And finally, once muscle failure is pending or has been established, a program of muscle rest, either complete or partial, pharmacotherapy, and goal-specific training should be instituted. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Their subunit compositions and quaternary structures were compared with 11S lytic enzyme which is derived from collagenase or trypsin treatment of the membranes and devoid of the tail unit. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent, appreciable populations of monomeric through tetrameric species are observed for the 11S form. Under the same conditions, the 16S form yields only monomer and dimer in addition to a higher molecular weight species. If complete reduction is effected, only the 80,000 molecular weight monomer is dominant for both the 11S and 16S forms. Cross-linking of the 11S form by dimethyl suberimidate followed by reduction yields monomer through tetramer in descending frequency, while the 16S form  again shows a high molecular weight species. A comparison of the composition of the 11S and 16S forms reveals that the latter has an increased glycine content, and 1.1 and 0.3 mol % hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively. Collagenases that have been purified to homogencity and are devoid of amidase and caseinolytic activity, but active against native collagen, will convert 16S acetylcholinesterase to the 11S form. Thus, composition and substrate behavior of the 16S enzyme are indicative of the tail unit containing a collagen-like sequence. A membrane fraction enriched in acetylcholinesterase and components of basement membrane can be separated from the major portion of the membrane protein. The 16S but not the 11S form reassociates selectively with this membrane fraction. These findings reveal distinct similarities between the tail unit of acetylcholinesterase and basement membrane components and suggest a primary association of AchE with the basement membrane. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two groups of postmenopausal women were followed, a younger group for an average of 3.74 years and an older group for an average of 2.37 years. It was determined that estimates of rate over periods less than two years were too low in precision to be useful. There were significant differences in rates among individuals. The loss of mineral from the midshaft site was determined to be linear within the precision of the method and over an average interval of 3.74 years. From these data the size of groups and length of time needed for a study to determine the effect of a treatment upon inhibition of bone loss was predicted. When the inhibition is 50 per cent of the control rate, it would be possible to detect a significant (alpha=0.05) inhibition with a certainty of 95 per cent (1-beta = 0.95), if 56 subjects were followed in each group for a period averaging 2.70 years. A more potent inhibition or more frequent visits would reduce the number of subjects and duration of study needed. The separation of individuals into groups of significantly more rapid and slower rates of loss was demonstrated. From these data, it is possible to predict that one-third of a sample could be so characterized after 3.5 years. The photon absorption technique can be applied to the measurement of the rate of loss of mineral with aging with a precision that is sufficicient for certain types of clinical investigations. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) producing IgM (spontaneous and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated) at the end of a seven day culture period was similar in PBC patients and control subjects while the amount of IgM synthesized (spontaneous and PWM stimulated) during this period was significantly greater in the patient group, implying that the amount of IgM produced per B cell was increased in PBC. Co-culture of autologous and allogeneic T and B lymphocytes and irradiation of T lymphocytes from patients and normal subjects clearly implicated abnormal suppressor T cell function, rather than autonomous B cell hyperactivity, as the cause of the increased IgM synthesis. Direct studies of T cell function indicated that although concanavalin A (Con A) activated suppressor cells inhibited proliferation of IgM producing B cells in the majority of PBC patients, they were unable to inhibit IgM synthesis. The demonstration of a disparity between IgM synthesis and the proliferation of IgM-producing B cells, together with the observation that the abnormality of T cell function is largely confined to the control of IgM secretion, is consistent with the presence of at least two different suppressor subpopulations regulating IgM production. In PBC the main suppressor cell abnormality seems to affect regulation of IgM secretion rather than B cell proliferation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The events that have been identified can be expressed temporally on a relative time scale, as shown in Figure 8. A major question that lies ahead concerns which of these events is causal for subsequent events and for GVBD. Clearly, the first event at 0.1 GVBD50, a decrease in cAMP, is both necessary and sufficient to induce GVBD. The increase in protein synthesis at 0.3 GVBD50 is apparently necessary, and the activity of MPF appearing at 0.4 GVBD50 is apparently sufficient, as judged by the microinjection assay. It is important to identify further steps after MPF appearance in order to establish the mechanism of action of MPF. The fact that events highly correlated with cell growth (i.e., pHi increase, S6 phosphorylation, and MPF appearance) all occur during amphibian oocyte maturation provides strong support for continued use of the oocyte in studying the general control of cell proliferation, particularly with the technique of microinjection. Investigation of the process of amphibian oocyte maturation has also led to the discovery of a totally new type of steroid hormone mechanism in which a plasma membrane steroid receptor is linked to the adenylate cyclase system. The oocyte system is the first example of a steroid hormone effect mediated by a direct effect on a target enzyme without a requirement for protein or RNA synthesis. The generality of this type of steroid hormone mechanism remains to be established, but its similarity to the P site on adenylate cyclase is suggestive evidence of a general mechanism, since the P site is present in all eukaryotic plasma membranes. Most steroid hormone systems have been investigated with respect to the mechanism of increased protein synthesis after steroid addition, with little attention to any cell division occurring. In the oocyte, the cell division effect of steroids is the predominant one; it is possible that this type of effect is mediated by a different receptor system than the one associated with changes in gene expression in somatic cells. The information described in this chapter hints at the complexity underlying the activation of development during the process of oocyte maturation. The finding that so many of the specific events and general mechanisms operating in oocyte maturation are also used in differentiated tissues strongly indicates that further study of amphibian oocyte maturation will lead to findings of general significance in terms of how information stored in the oocyte is used during development to result in a new member of the species. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Its stimulatory effect on plasminogen activation is far greater than that of the original poly(D-lysine), and even surpasses that of fibrin. Its effect on plasmin-catalysed modification of both tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and native (Glu-1-) plasminogen are also investigated. Cleavage of one-chain t-PA to its two-chain form is monitored by measuring the increase in amidolytic activity which accompanies this transformation. Presupposing apparent first-order reaction kinetics, a theory is developed by which the rate constant, kcat/Km = 1.0 X 10(6) M-1 X s-1 of plasmin cleavage of one-chain t-PA can be calculated. Plasmin-catalysed transformation of 125I-labelled Glu-1- to Lys-77-plasminogen is quantified following separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 3.2. A rate constant, kcat/Km = 4.4 X 10(3) M-1 X s-1 is obtained for the reaction between plasmin and Glu-1-plasminogen in the presence of 1 mM trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid. Both of the above plasmin-catalysed reactions are strongly enhanced by trinitrobenzoylated poly(D-lysine). The mechanism of action of this stimulator is elucidated by studying its binding to both activator and plasmin(ogen), and by direct comparison of the results with measurements of plasminogen activation kinetics in the presence of the stimulator. Binding studies are performed exploiting the observation that an insoluble yellow complex is formed between plasminogen and modified poly(D-lysine). Protein-polymer interactions are also studied with solubilised components in an aqueous two-phase partition system containing dextran and poly(ethylene glycol). The rate enhancement of plasminogen activation is found to be closely correlated to the association of plasminogen to the stimulator. It is proposed that the stimulator effects of this simple polymer on the enzymatic activities of both plasminogen activator and plasmin are brought about by association of the proteinase and its substrate to a common matrix. Similarities between the action of the artificial and the natural stimulator (fibrin) are stressed. These properties of trinitrobenzoylated poly(D-lysine) makes it useful as a model for the study of the regulatory mechanism of the fibrinolytic process at the molecular level. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Combined with fluorouracil (5-FU) as adjuvant treatment following resection of Dukes' stage C colon carcinomas, levamisole significantly reduces mortality. However, neither 5-FU nor levamisole alone has a significant effect on survival in this patient group. Previously, we noted that in vitro levamisole potentiated the antiproliferative activity of 5-FU. Because levamisole is known to inhibit alkaline phosphatases and has been reported to inhibit dephosphorylation of some membrane phosphoproteins, we studied the effects of levamisole analogues and of chemically unrelated inhibitors of phosphatases for their ability to potentiate 5-FU inhibition of tumor cell line proliferation in vitro. Human cancer cell lines were exposed to drugs alone or in combination with 5-FU. Antiproliferative activity was measured by determining the extent of reduction of colony formation by the cell lines in test plates compared with control plates. We found that potentiation of 5-FU cytotoxicity by levamisole and by p-hydroxytetramisole, a metabolite of levamisole, is mimicked by orthovanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, but not by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine and threonine phosphatases, Furthermore, l-p-bromotetramisole, a synthetic analogue of levamisole that is 10-fold more potent in inhibition of alkaline phosphatase than levamisole, potentiates the antiproliferative activity of 5-FU to a greater extent than d-p-bromotetramisole, a stereoisomer of l-p-bromotetramisole with little antiphosphatase activity. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases may be responsible for the potentiation by levamisole of the inhibitory activity of 5-FU in vitro. Inhibition of dephosphorylation of regulatory phosphoproteins may be related to the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of levamisole and 5-FU in the adjuvant treatment of colon carcinoma and may underlie at least some of the multiple effects of levamisole on immune parameters. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

[3H]Cholesterol was esterified with a series of variable chain length saturated acids and a series of variably unsaturated 18-carbon acids. These were incorporated into synthetic HDL particles along with 125I-labeled apoA-I as a tracer of HDL particles and [14C]cholesteryl oleate as an internal standard for normalization between preparations. Selective uptake by Y1-BS1 mouse adrenal cortical tumor cells was most extensively studied, but uptake by human HepG2 hepatoma cells and fibroblasts of human, rat, and rabbit origin were also examined. Acyl chain specificities for selective uptake and for CETP-mediated transfer were conversely related; selective uptake by all cell types decreased with increasing acyl chain length and increased with the extent of unsaturation of C18 chains. In contrast, CETP-mediated transfer increased with acyl chain length, and decreased with unsaturation of C18 chains. The specificities of human and rabbit CETP were also compared, and were found to differ little. Associated experiments showed that HDL-associated triglycerides, traced by [3H]glyceryl trioleyl ether, were selectively taken up but at a lesser rate than cholesteryl esters. The mechanism of this uptake appears to be the same as for selective uptake of cholesteryl esters. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Their mode of action involves three steps: binding to specific receptors located in the outer membrane, translocation across this membrane, and action on their targets. A specific colicin domain can be assigned to each of these steps. Colicins have been subdivided into two groups (A and B) depending on the proteins required for them to cross the external membrane. Plasmids were constructed which led to an overproduction of the Tol proteins involved in the import of group A colicins. In vitro binding of overexpressed Tol proteins to either Tol-dependent (group A) or TonB-dependent (group B) colicins was analyzed. The Tol dependent colicins A and E1 were able to interact with TolA but the TonB dependent colicin B was not. The C-terminal region of TolA, which is necessary for colicin uptake, was also found to be necessary for colicin A and E1 binding to occur. Furthermore, only the isolated N-terminal domain of colicin A, which is involved in the translocation step, was found to bind to TolA. These results demonstrate the existence of a correlation between the ability of group A colicins to translocate and their in vitro binding to TolA protein, suggesting that these interactions might be part of the colicin import process. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Histological diagnoses were: two cases of meningotheliomatous type, one hemangiopericytic type, one fibroblastic type, and one transitional type. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and metabolic rates of oxygen (rCMRO2) and glucose (rCMRG1) were measured with 15O2, C15O. 15O2, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose tracers. For the quantitative analysis, regions of interest were delineated on tumors, the peritumoral region, and the contralateral gray matter in comparison with age-corresponding 5 malignant gliomas and 5 normal volunteers. Tumor hemocirculatory parameters (rCBF: 57.2 +/- 22.6 ml/100 ml/min, rCBV: 7.95 +/- 3.27 ml/100 ml, mean + SD, n = 5) were markedly higher than those of the contralateral gray matter (p less than 0.05 by a Student-t test). The high values were consistent with angiographic findings of tumor staining and with abundant tumor vessels demonstrated by pathological examination. rCMRO2 was 2.15 +/- 0.80 ml/100 ml/min, which were comparable to those of the contralateral gray matter. Tumor rCMRG1 showed 4.76 +/- 2.37 mg/100 ml/min; the values of two cases were similar to the respective gray matter. The raised metabolic rate (rCMRO2/rCMRG1) therefore suggests rather aerobic glycolysis as compared with gliomas. Low rOEF (0.26 +/- 0.16) reveals an excessive blood flow beyond oxygen demand of the tumor. In the peritumoral regions, rCBF and metabolism fell slightly but rOEF reached a level similar to the contralateral gray matter, possibly due to hemocirculatory stasis caused by intracranial hypertension; in contrast, an unmatched reduction of rCBF and rCMRO2 implies tumor cells infiltration in gliomas.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although isovolumic hemodilution reduced hematocrit from 46 +/- 3% to 32 +/- 3% and increased coronary conductance, it neither abolished the curvilinearity nor changed Pf = 0, which remained significantly higher than left ventricular diastolic pressure. In 10 additional animals, DCPFRs obtained during blood perfusion were compared with those obtained using crystalloid perfusate. Crystalloid perfusion increased coronary conductance and failed to abolish curvilinearity. However, with crystalloid perfusate, Pf = 0 was reduced to a value essentially equal to left ventricular diastolic pressure. We conclude that while the rheological properties of coronary perfusates do not fully account for the curvilinearity of the DCPFR, they do importantly influence coronary conductance and Pf = 0. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This is a newly developed compound, in which the disulfide bond and [Pro-7] of deamino-oxytocin are substituted by an ethylene linkage and glycine respectively. Bioassayed Y-5350 exhibited 202.6 u/mg of oxytocic activity, 4.6 u/mg of avian depressor activity, 441.2 u/mg of rat milk-ejecting activity and 0.02 u/mg of rat antidiuretic activity, however, adepressor activity was also evident in rats. In particular, the diuration of antidiuretic activity was short. Moreover, the oxytocic activity in pregnant rats and rabbits was weak in comparison with oxytocin. Cumulative dose-response studies were carried out on the isolated rat uterus using van Dyke-Hasting solution. The intrinsic activity was the same level as that of oxytocin, and the pD2 value was 8.62. Oxytocic activity was much enhanced by the existence of 0.5 or 2mM magnesium ion in vitro. However, the agreement between in vivo and in vitro oxytocic activity was not complete when assay was carried out in the prescence of 2 mM magnesium ion. Oxytocin was inactivated by the serum of pregnant women. In the experiment using rats, oxytocin was also destroyed by the extracts of uterus, kidney and liver. In contrast, Y-5350 was not destroyed by any of the enzyme solutions mentioned above. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Calcium transients rose rapidly from an end-diastolic [Ca2+]i of 230 +/- 18 nM to a peak systolic [Ca2+]i of 619 +/- 34 nM (n = 21). Relaxation of the transients was slow, and continued throughout diastole. Bay K8644 (0.5 microM) markedly prolonged the action potential and caused similar prolongation of the calcium transients. Calcium transients in the presence of Bay K8644 had an inflection on their rising phase, which was followed by a more gradual increase that continued until the membrane had repolarized to a negative potential of -15 to -30 mV. Bay K8644 caused marked elevation of peak systolic [Ca2+]i to 955 +/- 56 nM (P less than 0.002), with concomitant elevation of end-diastolic [Ca2+]i to 400 +/- 36 nM (P less than 0.002). Optical recordings of contraction showed changes similar to those in the calcium transient: the initial upstroke of the contraction was followed by a more gradual second component, which gave the contraction a \"half-dome\" appearance. The time to peak [Ca2+]i and the time to peak contraction increased linearly with action potential duration (APD50). The effects of Bay K8644 were simulated, in part, by CsCl (7.5 mM), which produced equivalent prolongation of the action potential and calcium transients. However, CsCl did not elevate diastolic [Ca2+]i. To determine the mechanism of the diastolic [Ca2+]i increase, Bay K8644 was applied to aggregates rendered quiescent by tetrodotoxin. Bay K8644 caused a graded increase in [Ca2+]i, which was followed by resumption of spontaneous beating.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

All the patients had persistent proteinuria at the time of diagnosis, and were divided into three clinical groups on the basis of urinary findings at the time of examination: 27 patients had proteinuria with or without microscopic hematuria (group A; active stage), 9 had microscopic hematuria only (group B; healing stage) and 20 had normal urine (group C; remission stage). PBMC from the patients in group A cultured without mitogenic stimulation produced significantly more IgA and IgG than those from controls (p less than 0.05). After polyclonal B cell stimulation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), PBMC from patients in group A produced significantly more IgA than those from group B (p less than 0.05), group C (p less than 0.05) or controls (p less than 0.01), and produced significantly more IgG than those from group B (p less than 0.05) or controls (p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in PWM-stimulated IgG production between groups A and C. PWM-stimulated PBMC from patients in group C produced significantly more IgA and IgG than those from controls (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in lymphocyte subpopulations among groups A, B and C and controls. These findings show that the clinical course of childhood IgAN is correlated with IgA production by PBMC suggesting that overproduction of IgA might be responsible for the pathogenesis of IgAN in children. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The compound crystallizes in the space group P21/a with cell dimensions a equals 17.799(6), b equals 33.211(8), c equals 5.241(1) A, beta equals 91.88(2)degrees. There are two molecules, designated A and B in the asymmetrical unit, that are not related to each other by crystallographic symmetry. Their conformations are almost identical, and there are no significant differences in their bond lengths or angles. In both molecules the 5-hydroxyl group is equatorial while the 6-hydroxyl group is axial. This conformation is probably forced by steric hindrance between the hydroxyl group, 0-6, and the hydrogen atoms of the 7-methyl group. The molecules pack in the crystal by forming hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent molecules, A with A, B, with B, and A with B. The ring system of the cis-5,6-dihydrodiol is much more buckled than is that in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene itself. The angle between the two outermost rings is 36 degrees, the deviation from planarity being primarily a consequence of the partial saturation in the ring containing the two hydroxyl groups. Extrapolation of these results to other dihydrodiol derivatives of carcinogenic hydrocarbons permits some predictions of preferred molecular geometry. Thus, the 8,9-dihydrodiol-10,11-epoxide of 7,12-dimethylbenz]a[anthracene, analogous to the biologically active 7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide of benzo]a[pyrene, a mutagen that is believed to be an active intermediate in carcinogenesis by benzo]a[pyrene, should probably exist preferentially in a conformation bearing the8-hydroxyl group in the axial orientation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two other pregnant sows (group C) were kept uninoculated as control. When 7 weeks old, 8 piglets of group C were put in contact with 4 piglets of group A (group D), and 8 other piglets of group C with 4 piglets of group B (group E) in two separate pens with the purpose of testing the horizontal transmission of the viruses. All animals were kept under observation and serologically controlled at weekly intervals; two pigs of each group were finally submitted to a challenge with hog cholera virus. The two pigs of group E which were put in contact with the offspring of the border disease virus infected sow were protected; all other animals developed typical hog cholera symptoms and died. The relation between neutralizing titres of the sera to ruminant pestiviruses and protection to the challenge with hog cholera virus is discussed. The two protected pigs had high neutralizing antibody titres to border disease virus but no antibody to hog cholera virus at the time of the challenge. Though the two viruses look serologically distant, we surprisingly observed that infection with border disease virus protects against a superinfection with hog cholera virus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cells entrapped in calcium alginate showed a greater tolerance than cells grown in suspension. The extent of inhibition of growth of the immobilized cells depended on the period of growth in the gel matrix. After the addition of bacteriostatic concentrations of phenol or 4-chlorophenol, a dose-dependent efflux of metabolites such as ATP and of K+ ions was elicited. Provided that glucose was supplied as an energy substrate, a reaccumulation of K+ ions at low phenol concentrations was observed. The restoration of the membrane gradient for K+ always preceded the continuation of growth in the presence of the toxic compounds. Compared with free cells, those cells immobilized and grown in alginate suffered a smaller loss of cations after the addition of 4-chlorophenol. The reestablishment of gradients was observed at higher concentrations of the pollutants with entrapped cells than with free cells. Corresponding to the increase in tolerance, the membrane damage was reduced in cells grown in immobilized form for longer times. These data offer a mechanistic explanation of the protection of immobilized microorganisms from phenolic solvents. The data point to the membrane as an important cell component in the toxicity of these pollutants. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It was found that L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts, leukemic spleen, and BUdR-induced virus-producing cells contain virus-specific RNA: 0.05% (800 to 960 copies per cell), 0.02% (360 copies per cell), and 0.3% (5,120 copies per cell), respectively. Adult normal liver and spleen, on the other hand, contain less than 0.2 copy of viral RNA per cell. Both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts contained 14S, 22S, 35S, and 70S RNA species of total and cytoplasmic virus-specific RNA as determined by sucrose velocity gradient analysis and hybridization of sucrose gradient fractions to cDNA. Virus-specific mRNA was identified in both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts by the criterion that it cosedimented with purified polyribosomes in a sucrose gradient and that it changed to a lower sedimentation value if polyribosomes were disaggregated with EDTA prior to centrifugation. Virus-specific mRNA obtained from either the polyribosome region of purified polyribosomes or the released messenger region of EDTA-disaggregated purified polyribosomes consisted of 14S, 20S, and 35S species in both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts. Hybridization of cDNA to the RNA of L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts and BUdR-induced cells was essentially complete. Additionally, leukemic lymphoblast RNA could displace 95% of the hybridization of BUdR-induced GPV 70S RNA to guinea pig DNA. The midpoints of thermal denaturation of hybrids formed between GPV cDNA and the RNA of either L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts or the 70S RNA of BUdR-induced GPV were both 89 degrees C in 2x concentrated 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate. These results show that BUdR-induced GPV genes are essentially completely expressed in L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts and that virus-specific mRNA is present, although fewer copies of RNA are present in L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts than in BUdR-induced cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the highly beta-1-selective compound CGP 20712A was able to distinguish two binding sites on ICYP competition curves, a high-affinity \"beta-1 site\" (75%) and a low-affinity \"beta-2 site\" (25%). Also, in chick heart cell membranes the relative ability of agonists to displace ICYP produced a profile typical of beta-1 adrenergic receptors with a rank order of potency or efficacy of: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine = norephinephrine. When agonist-mediated adenylyl cyclase stimulation was assessed the order of potency was slightly different, isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than or equal to norepinephrine. Additionally, antagonism of isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by CGP 20712A yielded a Kb value (1.16 +/- 0.35 x 10(-7) M) intermediate between the high and low-affinity binding sites of CGP 20712A, suggesting that the low-affinity site is coupled to adenylyl cyclase. In membrane preparations of frog myocardial cells, ICYP/antagonist competition curves modeled for a mixed population of receptors, with subtype percentages varying from 50:50 beta-1:beta-2 to 100% beta-2 depending on the specific antagonist used and the individual cell preparation. For ICYP/agonist competition binding experiments the relative ability to displace ICYP was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine = norepinephrine, a profile typical of beta-1 adrenergic receptors.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the postabsorptive state hyperthyroid patients had normal concentrations of insulin and glucagon, but increased concentrations (P less than 0.01) and turnover rates (P less than 0.01) of glycerol, NEFA, and KB. The ratio of NEFA appearance rate to glycerol appearance rate was decreased in hyperthyroid subjects (2.34 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.15 +/- 0.22; P less than 0.05), indicating that intracellular cycling between triglycerides and fatty acids was increased. The percentage of NEFA flux used for KB production, calculated from NEFA disappearance rates and KB appearance rates, was increased in hyperthyroid patients (21.20 +/- 2.75% vs. 13.37 +/- 0.63%; P less than 0.05), suggesting a diversion during hyperthyroidism of hepatic fatty acid metabolism toward ketogenesis. However, when the plasma NEFA levels of control subjects were raised by the infusion of a triglyceride emulsion to levels comparable to those observed in hyperthyroid patients their percentage of NEFA flux used for ketogenesis rose to values slightly higher (26.30%) than those of hyperthyroid subjects. In conclusion, 1) hyperthyroidism results not only in increased lipolysis, but also in enhanced triglyceride-fatty acid cycling, which could contribute to the excessive energy expenditure; and 2) the increased KB production of hyperthyroid patients results more from an increase in NEFA availability than from a direct stimulation of hepatic ketogenesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Even though MHC polymorphism has long been known to affect both peptide binding and recognition by the TCR, the role of individual amino acids of MHC proteins in these interactions is poorly understood. To examine the effect of a small number of amino acid residues on T cell stimulation, B lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the closely related DR1 subtypes, Dw1 and Dw20, and the DR4 subtypes, Dw4 and Dw14, were compared for their ability to present an immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin peptide (HA307-319) to an Ag-specific, DR1,4-restricted T cell clone. B cell lines expressing DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14 presented HA307-319 much less efficiently than DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4 and bound a biotinylated analogue of the same peptide less well. Analysis of DRB1 gene sequences suggested that polymorphism at residue 86 had a major effect on peptide binding. Differences in binding of a set of HA307-319 analogues biotinylated at each residue to cells expressing DR1 Dw1 and DR1 Dw20 suggested that the polymorphism affected the interactions of many peptide residues with the class II molecule. In inhibition assays, DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4 were shown to differ from DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14 in their length requirements for peptide binding. Using a larger panel of homozygous B cell lines expressing many class II haplotypes, a Ser-309 substituted HA307-319 analogue was shown to bind to most B cell lines expressing Val-86 containing alleles (including DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14) but failed to bind most B cell lines expressing Gly-86 alleles (including DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4). The results indicated that polymorphism at residue 86 influenced the specificity and affinity of peptide binding and affected the conformation of peptide-DR protein complexes without completely eliminating T cell recognition. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

An A1-14 peptide containing three cys-residues that were protected by S-sulfonate groups still needed processing by APC for efficient presentation similar to native insulin. We suspected that reductive deblocking or opening of disulfide bonds that generates CysSH-residues may be an essential processing step for these Ag. Due to the instability of SH-groups it was not possible to test A chain peptides with free SH-groups in the usual way for processing-independent presentation by fixed APC. However, under acidic conditions (pH 5) during APC pulsing with the Ag we could demonstrate that the freshly reduced A1-14 fragment as well as reduced insulin are able to bind to Ia Ag and to stimulate appropriate T cells without further processing. Various substitutions of cys-residues by Ser within this peptide revealed that only CysA7 is critical for Ia binding and/or T cell recognition. In intact insulin, this residue links the A chain containing the T cell epitope to the B chain. Therefore, we propose that insulin processing is not dependent on proteolysis or on the generation of a conformational determinant but on the separation of A and B chains resulting in A chains whose cys-residues are converted into CysSH. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Based on this idea, the respiratory muscles obtained by biopsies during operation from diaphragm, external intercostal muscle, and rectus abdominis muscle were assessed histochemically in 32 patients. The specimens were stained for myosin ATPase to differentiate the types of muscle fibers, and then the size and distribution of the muscle fibers of each type were measured. In diaphragm muscle, cross-sectional areas of type 1 & 2 and the ratio of the area occupied by each fiber were usually the same; in external intercostal muscle, however, type 1 fibers were dominant and in rectus abdominis muscle, type 2 fibers were dominant. The cross-sectional area of each respiratory muscle fiber well correlated with certain anthropometrical indexes, and the nutritionally depleted cases, the muscle fibers were of a smaller size suggesting less respiratory muscle strength. The ratio of the area occupied by type 1 fibers in diaphragm muscle was linearly related to serum albumin, total cholesterol, and PNI (prognostic nutritional index). Type 2 fibers were dominant in malnourished patients, suggesting greater fatigue compared to well-nourished cases. Opposite findings were obtained in external intercostal muscle and rectus abdominis muscle, and the ratio of the area occupied by type 2 fibers was smaller in the undernourished cases, suggesting reduced maximum strength of these muscles.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The major endpoint for the study was the achievement of clinical beta blockade (heart rate 50-60 beats/min and less than or equal to 20% rise in treadmill stage I heart rate). Betaxolol produced a decrease in mean angina pectoris frequency from 6.6 +/- 1.9 episodes/week with placebo to 0.2 +/- 0.5 episode/week during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005). Mean treadmill exercise time increased from 3.1 +/- 1.7 min with placebo to 7.3 +/- 2.3 min with doses sufficient to reduce angina pectoris frequency greater than or equal to 75% (p less than 0.00005) and to 8.0 +/- 2.3 min during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005).

This review catalogs data about specific molluscan neurons, but the greater importance of this material is in the broad picture of how a neuronal membrane maintains internal potential and is responsive to changes in the environment. Electrical properties of the membrane. The mechanisms which contribute to the resting potential in molluscan neurons can be separated into ionic and metabolic components. When the electrogenic sodium pump is eliminated experimentally, the ionic component of the potential follows the constant field equation quite closely. Many of the \"constants\" and \"parameters\" which characterize the membrane of molluscan neurons are actually variables which depend upon temperature, ionic environment, and membrane potential. The evaluation of the electrical parameters is complicated by extensive infoldings of the somatic membrane, and by large axons which drain current from the soma. Most molluscan neurons have a very high specific membrane resistance and a correspondingly low potassium permeability. Membrane capacitance is close to the 1 microF/cm2 value which characterizes biological membranes. The current-voltage relation of molluscan neurons may be complicated by inward-going rectification, but if that is inhibited the I-V curve follows the prediction of either the constant field equation or a simple electrical model. Factors which modify membrane behavior. The resting potential of molluscan neurons is very sensitive to changes in temperature and Ko, through a combination of effects upon the electrogenic sodium pump, inward-going rectification, and the membrane \"parameters\". Inward-going rectification depends upon a rectifying K conductance, and can be eliminated by cold or the removal of Ko. Strong or prolonged currents have time-dependent effects upon the membrane, and excessive polarization leads to a \"high conductance state\". The underlying (non-rectifying) K permeability of the membrane is relatively insensitive to temperature and ionic changes, whereas the Na permeability increases with warming. Membrane resistance varies with both temperature and ions (because the I-V curve is sensitive to these conditions) but membrane capacitance is relatively insensitive to external factors. Electrogenic sodium transport. Sodium transport is electrogenic in molluscan neurons. It can be stimulated by warm temperatures and an excess of substrate (e.g. high Nai); it can be inhibited by cold, by an absence of substrate (e.g. low Ko), or by pharmacologic agents such as cyanide or ouabain.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to study a calcium-activated chloride current, the potassium currents were blocked by intracellular cesium diffusion. Without EGTA in the pipette solution, depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of -70 mV to positive potentials activated an early inward and a late outward current. The latter persisted as a long-lasting inward tail current when the membrane was repolarized to -70 mV. The outward current measured at the end of the pulse and the tail current were blocked by extracellular cobalt, after replacement of external calcium with barium, after removal of external calcium, and when the calcium concentration of the pipette solution was less than 0.5 microM, suggesting that they were calcium-dependent. The tail current decay was voltage sensitive, becoming faster with hyperpolarization. The reversal potential of the calcium-activated current was near the equilibrium potential for chloride ions, and was shifted as predicted by the Nernst equation when the extracellular or intracellular chloride concentration was changed. The calcium-activated current was blocked by adding micromolar concentrations of niflumic acid or millimolar concentrations of DIDS. This effect of compounds known to interfere with chloride channels together with the data on the equilibrium potential for chloride ions indicated above suggested the existence of a calcium-activated chloride current in vascular smooth muscle cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

AHR-13268D protects sensitive guinea pigs from collapse induced by aerosolized antigen; 1, 5, and 24 h ED50s in the test were 0.27, 0.25, 0.93 mg/kg, PO, respectively. AHR-13268D was also active when given as an aerosol, the 1 h ED50 = 0.29%. In the rat passivefoot anaphylaxis test. AHR-13268D was slightly more active (1.55 times) than AHR-5333B when given orally 1 h prior to challenge and equipotent to cromolyn when given intravenously immediately prior to challenge. AHR-13268D displayed potent, long-acting antihistaminic activity in naive guinea pigs; the 1, 5, and 24 h oral ED50s being in the range of 0.3 mg/kg. AHR-13268D (10 to 20 mg/kg, PO) attenuated the skin responses to ascaris antigen in sensitive dogs and did not alter the EEG pattern or sleep/wake patterns of cats at doses in vast excess of its antihistaminic activity. In vitro, AHR-13268D was a potent inhibitor of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (IC50 = 0.51 nM) and was as potent as the reference 5-LO inhibitor phenidone in inhibiting antigen-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum in the presence of pyrilamine, atropine, and imidazole (IC50 approximately 300 microM). AHR-13268B was bioavailable (approximately 88%) from capsules or from oral solutions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty-eight percent were premature and 24% weighed less than 2.0 kg. Major symptoms included excess salivation (56 patients), respiratory distress (28 patients), cyanosis (26 patients), and choking (nine patients). Pneumonia and or atelectasis occurred in 58% and associated anomalies in 68%. Seventy-three of 84 patients (87%) had proximal esophageal atresia and distal TE fistula (type C defect). Operation was carried out in 79 patients. Gastrostomy was performed in 75 patients, often under local anesthesia with subsequent delayed extrapleural thoractomy (mean, 3.9 days), when the infant's pulmonary condition was improved. Primary anastomosis was performed in 55 patients, division TE fistula and esophagostomy in ten, staged anastomosis in seven, cervical esophagostomy alone in three, division H fistual in two, ligation TE fistula alone in one, and gastrostomy alone in one. Complications were frequent, including need for ventilator support in 28 patients, atelectasis in 28, pneumonia in 18, jaundice in 13, heart failure in 11, anastomotic leak in 10, and stricture in four. Operative mortality was 5% (four of 79). Two deaths followed immediate thoracotomy and two were premature with anomalies. There were eight late deaths 4 to 39 months after operation. Seven had multiple anomalies. The overall mortality was 15%. Management of high-risk cases by preliminary gastrostomy and delayed extrapleural thoracotomy is associated with improved survival (67 to 79) (85%). Neonatal intensive care, detection of associated anomalies, and long-term follow-up are essential factors in reducing mortality. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

No information is available regarding the functional role of these two species or whether their expression is regulated concordantly in states in which hepatic glucose uptake or output are markedly altered. In this study, we analyzed the effect of fasting and refeeding and streptozocin-induced diabetes and subsequent insulin treatment on the expression of the erythroid/brain and liver GT polypeptides and their mRNAs in rat liver. The erythroid/brain GT mRNA in livers of control rats corresponded to 1-3% of the amount of liver GT mRNA. After a 4-day fast, its level increased approximately 3-fold and represented 8-10% of the liver GT mRNA, whereas the corresponding protein increased 4-fold. In livers from diabetic rats, levels of the erythroid/brain GT mRNA increased up to 2.4-fold and gradually returned to normal with chronic insulin treatment. Levels of the corresponding protein were minimally altered. Levels of immunoreactive liver GTs were not significantly changed by 2 days of fasting, 7 or 14 days of diabetes, or subsequent insulin treatment for 3, 5, or 7 days but increased up to 75% with refeeding for 3-48 h. Liver GT mRNA levels minimally decreased in diabetic or insulin-treated rats, decreased 45% after a 2-day fast, and increased up to 5-fold on refeeding for 24 h.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It is shown that the object signal-to-noise ratio scales directly with the voxel volume and the square root of the number of voxels. Defining an efficiency figure of merit as the SNR divided by the square root of the imaging time, it is shown that efficiency is always improved when imaging with the lowest possible resolution (largest voxel dimensions) consistent with viewing the desired anatomical detail. The results directly imply the relative efficiency of 3-D (volume), 2-D (plane), 1-D (line) and 0-D (point) imaging techniques. It is shown that spatial averaging is an inefficient method of noise reduction in MRI. As long as voxel size is maintained constant, one can image as many pixels in the readout direction as desired with no loss in SNR; that is, the number of pixels in the readout direction has no effect on the image SNR. Further, multiple sampling of each phase encoding value (to improve SNR) has no advantage over increasing the number of pixels in the phase encoding direction while leaving the voxel size constant. Some experimental observations are given. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The response time of this system (0 to 90% of final value) was 36 sec. In seven pregnant sheep (128--135 days gestation) the maternal inspired mixture was abruptly changed and the following changes in fetal PaO2 and PaCO2 were observed: (1) 100% O2 to room air: PaO2 decreased from 21.5 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SEM) to 14 +/- 1.1 mm Hg at a rate of 1.63 +/- 0.33 mm Hg/min. Following return to 100% O2 the PaO2 returned to 21 +/- 1.1 mm Hg at a rate of 2.44 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/min. (2) 100% O2 to 12% O2/10% CO2: after 6 min the PaO2 fell from 19.3 +/- 1.3 to 6.3 +/- 0.3 mm Hg at a rate of 4.65 mm Hg/min and the PaCO2 rose from 37 +/- 8 to 70 +/-5 mm Hg.

The patients presented with symptoms and signs of febrile focal encephalopathy. The age ranged from 1 month to 76 years (mean 37.3 years). Only 6 were infants less than one year old. HSE was diagnosed in 50 patients by the demonstration of intrathecal HSV antibody production and/or by HSV isolation or antigen detection in brain tissue specimens. A total of 308 CT examinations--the majority performed during the first 5 days after onset of CNS symptoms--were evaluated under blind conditions. The correct diagnosis of HSE was usually suggested within 5 days after onset of neurologic symptoms yielding a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.89. Predominant location of the HSE lesions was the temporal lobes (88%), which rarely were involved in the non-HSE group (11%). Haemorrhage was a rare finding (12% ) and enhancement after intravenous contrast administration was insignificant. Repeat examinations further increased accuracy. It is concluded that the good reliability of high resolution CT, further improvement of immunologic techniques and the advent of new atoxic antiviral drugs all are factors which may in the future obviate the need for brain biopsy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Additionally, there is in vitro evidence suggesting that fluoride accelerates and magnesium inhibits the hydrolysis of OCP to hydroxyapatite (OHAp). As the amount of OCP or brushite in enamel cannot be measured directly in the presence of an excess of hydroxyapatite, a procedure was developed that allows for their indirect in vivo quantification as pyrophosphate. This permits study of the effects of fluoride and magnesium ions on enamel mineral synthesis. Rat incisor calcium phosphate was labeled by intraperitoneal injection of NaH2(32)PO4. The rats were then subjected to various fluoride and magnesium treatments with subcutaneous implanted osmotic pumps. They were then killed at predetermined intervals; the nascent sections of the incisors were collected, cleaned, and pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C for 48 hours to convert acidic calcium phosphates to calcium pyrophosphate; the pyrophosphate was separated from orthophosphate by anion-exchange chromatography; and the resulting fractions were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The activities of the pyro- and orthophosphate fractions were used to calculate the amount of acidic calcium phosphate present in the nascent mineral. The results demonstrated that the percentage of radioactive pyrophosphate in nascent incisors decreased with time, with increasing serum F- concentration, and with decreasing serum magnesium content. The technique described here should prove to be a powerful new tool for studying the effects of various agents on biological mineral formation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results from this were correlated with fine structure findings obtained from analyses made in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). In both the NICM and SEM it was possible to identify intracellular perinuclear structures, which most likely represent aggregates of measles nucleocapsids. These structures appeared in the NICM as opaque vesicles and in the SEM as bulges in the flattened cells. The SEM also proved to be used for determining cell surface characteristics specific for the carrier culture, which were lacking in uninfected Lu106 cells. In the carrier culture, there were vesiculated cells with bled-like polymorphic and ridged projections, and cells with webbed cytoplasmic extensions. Ridges and transverse striations observed on these cellular protrusions and on microvilli possibly denote oriented viral nucleocapsids at the cell membrane. Furthermore in the carrier cells, the microvilli were more heterogenous in length and diameter and were more frequently branched or fused together when compared to microvilli in uninfected cells. The results are discussed in view of the available information on the appearance of virus-infected or virus-transformed cells in the SEM, also inregard to the various factors, other than virus infection, which play a role in determining the surface features of monolayer cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Prospective longitudinal study. Assisted Reproduction Unit of the Hospital ClÃ­nic i Provincial in Barcelona. Five in vitro fertilization patients with ascites because of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Measurement during the syndrome and 4 weeks after recovery of the following: cardiac output, arterial pressure, estimated peripheral vascular resistances, hematocrit, standard renal function tests, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine and antidiuretic hormone concentrations, and urinary excretion of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. During the syndrome, all patients showed arterial hypotension (74.2 +/- 3.8 versus 85.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg), tachycardia, increased cardiac output (6.4 +/- 0.2 versus 4.4 +/- 0.1 L/min), low peripheral vascular resistance (929 +/- 52 versus 1,568 +/- 51 dyn/sec per cm-5), high plasma levels of renin (72 +/- 25 versus 0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/mL per h-1), norepinephrine (639 +/- 141 versus 203 +/- 21 pg/mL) and antidiuretic hormone (6.1 +/- 1.6 versus 1.5 +/- 0.1 pg/mL), and increased urinary excretion of PGE2 (551 +/- 152 versus 106 +/- 44 pg/min) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (470 +/- 76 versus 99 +/- 11 pg/min). No evidence of hemoconcentration, as assessed by hematocrit, was observed in any patient. (1) Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is related to marked arteriolar vasodilation that leads to underfilling of the arterial vascular compartment and stimulation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems and (2) the increased urinary excretion of PGs probably represents a homeostatic response to antagonize the renal effects of these systems. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Not investigated so far, however, is the question of whether there exists also an 'amplitopic organization' of the human auditory cortex, i.e., a spatial distribution of neurons maximally responsive to respective 'best stimulus intensities.' We measured, in the study presented here, in 3 normally hearing subjects the auditory evoked magnetic field (AEF) in response to tone-burst stimulation with a carrier frequency of 1000 Hz at 6 different intensities (30-80 dB HL in 10 dB steps). The influence of stimulus intensity was quantified in terms of changes in the ECD parameters (amplitude, direction and spatial coordinates) which were determined such that a maximum correspondence between observed and calculated field distributions was obtained. The results of the neuromagnetic measurements presented here prove that the ECD location also shifts with changing stimulus intensity. The depth of wave M100 (latency of about 100 msec) decreases monotonically with increasing stimulus intensity while the horizontal ECD position is slightly shifted in the anterior direction. The results imply that, while topical mechanisms of frequency coding are similar at cortex and at the cochlear level, topical mechanisms of intensity coding are different at these levels. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Both compounds have low acute oral toxicity and low skin absorption toxicity. They are neither primary skin irritants or skin sensitizers and are only mildly irritating to the eyes. A 30-day dietary feeding study in rats established 8 mg DBDPO/kg-day as an unequivocal no-effect level and 80 mg/kg-day as a marginal effect level. A no-effect level was not established for OBBP in a comparative study. A 2-yr rat study providing 0.1 mg DBDPO/kg-day in the diet revealed the bromine concentration reached a plateau in the liver within 30 days, while the concentration in adipose tissue slowly increased. A comparable OBBP study revealed bromine concentration in the liver and adipose tissue increased steadily and rapidly with no attainment of a plateau during 180 days of the study. Neither compound produced an accumulation of bromine in other tissues. After administration of 14C DBDPO, all 14C activity was eliminated via the feces within 2 days. After administration of 14C OBBP, 62% was eliminated with a half-life of less than 24 hr; the half-life for the remainder was greater than 16 days.

There were 13 deaths, a mortality of 5 per cent. A comparison between the three consecutive 2-year periods of study showed an initial mortality of 6 per cent for the first 4 years falling to 2 per cent for the 93 admissions during the final 2 years of experience. Of the 120 patients treated surgically, 10 died in hospital, giving an operative mortality of 8 per cent. The trend in operative mortality was from 13 per cent for the initial 2-year period to 8 per cent for the second period and to 3 per cent for the final 2 years. The operative rate was consecutively 45, 50 and 34 per cent. There was 1 death in conservatively treated patients during each 2-year period of study. Three types of operation were performed: vagotomy, pyloroplasty and oversewing of the ulcer; Polya gastrectomy; and vagotomy and antrectomy. There was no difference in morbidity and mortality between these operations. At a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, 90 per cent of the patients had a good result from their operation.

The syndrome, defined as growth retardation, midface hypoplasia, and neurologic dysfunction, represents only part of the spectrum of fetal alcohol effects. The biochemical mechanism of teratogenesis is unknown. In adults, metabolites of ethanol, FAEE, are known to accumulate in major organs. The formation of FAEE is catalyzed by a family of enzymes, FAEE synthases. Our hypothesis is that accumulation of FAEE in the embryo results in fetal alcohol syndrome. We have developed assays for FAEE and FAEE synthase activity using mg of tissue. Using these assays, we have shown the following: Human placenta, mouse placenta, heart, and liver are active in catalyzing the formation of FAEE. One h after maternal ethanol administration on gestational d 14, mouse placenta and fetuses accumulated significant quantities of FAEE. The fatty acid incorporated into FAEE was tissue dependent. Tissues from pregnant animals given ethanol on gestational d 7 showed persistence of FAEE on gestational d 14. We conclude that: 1) human and mouse placentas have significant FAEE synthase activity, 2) mouse heart, liver, placenta, and fetal tissues accumulate significant amounts of FAEE after maternal ethanol exposure, 3) there is tissue specificity for the fatty acid incorporated into FAEE, and 4) FAEE may persist for 7 d in placentas. These results provide a basis for further research into the role of FAEE in the development of fetal alcohol syndrome. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

L-651,582 inhibited 45Ca++ uptake, as well as [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation into soluble nucleotide pools, in MDBK cells at concentrations similar to those required for antiparasitic activity (IC50 = 0.3 microgram/ml). However, the drug did not inhibit the [3H] hypoxanthine incorporation into the nucleotide pools of the intracellular E. tenella under the same conditions. The antiparasitic activity of several L-651,582 analogs paralleled their ability to inhibit [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation in MDBK cells. L-651,582 similarly inhibited the growth of the intracellular parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii in vitro with either HeLa cells or Normal Human Fibroblasts as host cells. The IC50 for inhibition of T. gondii growth in normal human fibroblasts was similar to that for [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation inhibition. In HeLa cells, however, 40-fold higher levels were required for the inhibition of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation than were required to inhibit parasite growth, showing that antiparasitic activity was not a consequence of the alteration in host nucleotide metabolism. This was also consistent with the observation that the effect of L-651,582 against E. tenella in MDBK cells was not reversed by the addition of nutrients involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. This study suggests that L-651,582 has antiparasitic activity which correlates with host cell effects and which may be a result of blocking Ca++ entry in the host cells, but is not the result of an alteration of host nucleotide biosynthesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Using the well-studied sequence of events that occurs during spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis in the mouse, aatids was measured by the unscheduled incorporation of [3H]dT into these germ cells which were recovered from the caudal epididymides 16 days after chemical treatment. Purification of the caudal sperm DNA at this time verified that the [3H]dT was incorporated into the DNA. For each chemical mutagen a study was made on the level of DNA repair occurring in early spermatids as a function of the administered, in vivo dose. Within experimental errors, all four chemicals produced a linear increase in DNA repair in early spermatids with increasing dose. Only the highest dose of MMS (100 mg/kg) produced a greater repair response than expected for a linear curve. At equimolar doses the most effective chemical in inducing DNA repair was MMS, followed by EMS, IMS and PMS. When testicular injections of [3H]dT were given at the same time as the intraperitoneal injections of the mutagens, the amount of unscheduled incorporation of [3H]dT into the DNA of early spermatids was maximized. Since [3H]dT has been shown to be available for incorporation into germ-cell DNA for only approximately 1 h after injection, all four mutagens must reach the DNA of early spermatids and begin producing \"repairable\" lesions within 1 h after treatment. The amount of DNA repair occurring at later times after chemical treatment of early spermatids was studied by testicular injections of [3H]dT 1/2, 1, 2 and 3 days after chemical treatment. Repair was still occurring in the early spermatids at 3 days post-treatment; this repair is most likely a manifestation of the finite rate of the repair process rather than resulting from newly alkylated DNA. For MMS and EMS there was a rapid decrease in the level of DNA repair in the first 1/2 day following treatment. This was followed by a much slower, exponential decrease in the level of repair out to 3 days post-treatment. The curves suggest that the amount of repair is proportional to the number of repairable lesions still present in the DNA. For PMS and IMS the level of repair decreases rapidly in the first 1/2 day after treatment and thereafter remains relatively constant through 3 days post-treatment. With all four mutagens, DNA repair in early spermatids was detectable at doses 5 to 10 times lower than those required to observe other genetic end points such as dominant lethals, translocations and specific-locus mutations in any germ-cell stage. The sensitivity of detection of in vivo DNA repair in the germ cells of male mice makes such a system a useful adjunct to other genetic tests for studying chemical mutagenesis in mammals. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

FcRs are involved in regulating antibody production as well. Most FcRs belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and show structural homology with each other and with their ligands. Recent data on the structure of IgG binding FcRs obtained from monoclonal antibodies and gene cloning studies, as well as on ligand binding capacity and fine specificity of the receptor binding site (or sites), are reviewed. The binding capacity and fine specificity of receptor binding sites, as well as the structure and conformation of the immunoglobulin ligands, play important roles in triggering FcR-mediated signals. In induction of signals, the interaction of the FcR with the CH2 domain of the IgGFc is decisive. The high-affinity Fc gamma RI possess one active binding site specific for contact residues that is located at the N-proximal end of the CH2 domain and is able to mediate both binding and signal transfer. The low-affinity Fc gamma RIII has two active binding sites: the CH3 domain-specific site, which mediates only binding; and the CH2 domain-specific site, which is responsible for binding and signaling.

We challenged this conclusion and that for three reasons: Violent suicide attempt accumulates in certain types of depression making it impossible to conclude whether the biological variable relates to (auto)aggression or to that type of depression as such. Nondepressed suicide attempter is a diagnosis that should be based on presuicidal not on postsuicidal data, in order to avoid false-positive diagnoses. Suicide method is not a reliable index of seriousness of the attempt. Risk/rescue ratio should be used instead. Next the data are discussed that do support the hypothesis that diminished 5-HT metabolism in the brain is related to disregulation of aggression. Finally, the hypothesis is launched that both mood and aggression disorders are related to decreased 5-HT metabolism in the CNS. This would provide a biological explanation for the clinical observation that disorders in mood and in aggression often go hand in hand. Biological research of psychiatric disorders gains in informative value as the psychopathological analysis of the phenomena one studies is more comprehensive. Biological suicide research is no exception to this rule. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the resistance was not evoked in mice given either infective eggs of Toxocara canis or non-viable oncospheres of all cestode species examined. Congenitally athymic nude mice given viable oncospheres did not show any resistance to H. nana either. Eosinophil infiltration around cysticercoids of H. nana in the intestinal villi appeared to be more prominent in mice previously given viable oncospheres of H. diminuta than in mice given non-viable oncospheres or PBS only. Some of the eosinophils in the villus harboring cysticercoid(s) of H. nana invaded the epithelia in the former, whereas all eosinophils remained in the lamina propria in the latter. There was almost no eosinophil infiltration in nude mice. Microscopic observations revealed that oncospheres of H. diminuta, which require beetles as the intermediate host like H. microstoma, could invade the mouse intestinal tissue. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the strong cross resistance to H. nana in mice, induced by oncospheres of all heterologous cestode species, is thymus-dependent and due to oncospheral invasion into the intestinal tissue of mice. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Based on an analysis of data provided by regional specialists in the Czech Republic and by regional (district) specialists in internal medicine in Slovak republic it may be said that in the majority of health institutions the number of endocrinologists does not reach even the unsatisfactory standard (i. e. 1 endocrinologist per 150 to 250,000 population), that specialized training of endocrinologists, specialists in internal medicine and other specialist is not ensured, that there are not adequate numbers of community doctors and factory medical officers, that there are not adequate capacities of specialized laboratory examinations and that adequate collaboration with other disciplines is not ensured (the position is in particular alarming as regards immunological methods and cytological processing of specimens obtained by aspiration biopsy from the thyroid gland. With regard to these data the authors recommend to raise the numbers of endocrinologists so that in institutions corresponding to hospitals with policlinics type II there will be one endocrinologist per 50-100,000 population, to improve the standard and availability of auxiliary examinations, to ensure endocrinological in-patient care at the level of hospitals with policlinics type III and to create specialized centres within the framework of the research base or university hospitals.

While the importance of radial glial fibers in this process has long been recognized, data from recent investigations have suggested that other mechanisms might also play a role in directing the movement of young neurons. We have labeled autonomic preganglionic cells by microinjections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the sympathetic chain ganglia of embryonic rats in order to study the migration and differentiation of these spinal cord neurons. Our results, in conjunction with previous observations, suggest that the migration pattern of preganglionic neurons can be divided into three distinct phases. In the first phase, the autonomic motor neurons arise in the ventral ventricular zone and migrate radially into the ventral horn of the developing spinal cord, where, together with somatic motor neurons, they form a single, primitive motor column (Phelps P. E., Barber R. P., and Vaughn J. E. (1991). J. Comp. Neurol. 307:77-86). During the second phase, the autonomic motor neurons separate from the somatic motor neurons and are displaced dorsally toward the intermediate spinal cord. When the preganglionic neurons reach the intermediolateral (IML) region, they become progressively more multipolar, and many of them undergo a change in alignment, from a dorsoventral to a mediolateral orientation. In the third phase of autonomic motor neuron development, some of these cells are displaced medially, and occupy sites between the IML and central canal. The primary and tertiary movements of the preganglionic neurons are in alignment with radial glial processes in the embryonic spinal cord, an arrangement that is consistent with a hypothesis that glial elements might guide autonomic motor neurons during these periods of development. In contrast, during the second phase, the dorsal translocation of preganglionic neurons occurs in an orientation perpendicular to radial glial fibers, indicating that glial elements are not involved in the secondary migration of these cells. The results of previous investigations have provided evidence that, in addition to glial processes, axonal pathways might provide a substrate for neuronal migration. Logically, therefore, it is possible that the secondary dorsolateral translocation of autonomic preganglionic neurons could be directed along early forming circumferential axons of spinal association interneurons, and this hypothesis is supported by the fact that such fibers are appropriately arrayed in both developmental time and space to guide this movement. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Past work has shown that the hemorrhage-induced release of ACTH and cortisol is potentiated by prior hemorrhage. We therefore studied the response of adrenal aldosterone secretion to repeated hemorrhage and its control by ACTH and AII. Six awake dogs with chronic lumboadrenal vein catheters were bled 10% of measured blood volume (H1) with reinfusion at 30 minutes. The hemorrhage was repeated 5 hours later (H2). Adrenal presentation rates for AII (AII-PR) and ACTH (ACTH-PR) were calculated for each sample. Control hormonal and hemodynamic parameters before each hemorrhage were not different; hemodynamic responses to H1 and H2 did not differ. Aldosterone secretion increased significantly after each hemorrhage. The increase in aldosterone secretion after H1 was associated with an early increase in AII-PR and late increase in ACTH-PR. Aldosterone secretion following H2 was greater than that following H1 and was associated with early and larger responses of AII-PR and ACTH-PR. Aldosterone secretion following H1 correlated with the AII-PR (r = 0.75; p less than 0.001), but not with the ACTH-PR. In contrast, aldosterone secretion following H2 correlated with both the AII-PR (r = 0.54; p less than 0.01) and ACTH-PR (r = 0.71; p less than 0.001) and multiple regression analysis showed a highly significant relation with both AII and ACTH (r = 0.81; p less than 0.001). The data suggest that aldosterone secretion after initial small hemorrhage occurs as a result of increased AII, whereas both AII and ACTH may contribute to the larger aldosterone secretory response to H2. Since major trauma commonly involves at least two insults separated in time (e.g., injury followed by surgery), potentiated responses of aldosterone and other pituitary-adrenal hormones (ACTH, vasopressin, and cortisol) may have important implications for the control of fluid and electrolyte balance and metabolism in injured patients. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The current experiments were designed to determine whether cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived mediators contribute to the phosgene induced lung injury. We exposed rabbits to phosgene (1,500 ppm/min), killed the animals 30 min later, and then perfused the lungs with a saline buffer for 90 min. Phosgene markedly increased lung weight gain, did not appear to increase the synthesis of cyclooxygenase metabolites, but increased 10-fold the synthesis of lipoxygenase products. Pre- or posttreatment with indomethacin decreased thromboxane and prostacyclin levels without affecting leukotriene synthesis and partially reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. Methylprednisolone pretreatment completely blocked the increase in leukotriene synthesis and lung weight gain. Posttreatment with 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a nonmetabolized competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, or the leukotriene receptor blockers, FPL 55712 and LY 171883, also dramatically reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. These results suggest that lipoxygenase products contribute to the phosgene-induced lung damage. Because phosgene exposure did not increase cyclooxygenase synthesis or pulmonary arterial pressure, we tested whether phosgene affects the lung's ability to generate or to react to thromboxane. Infusing arachidonic acid increased thromboxane synthesis to the same extent in phosgene-exposed lungs as in control lungs; however, phosgene exposure significantly reduced pulmonary vascular reactivity to thromboxane but not to angiotension II and KCl. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The distal axon tips of optic nerves were transected at the margin of the tectal lobe and regeneration of the nerve was followed by three methods: autoradiography, tissue section counting following [3H]proline injection into the eye, and electrophysiological mapping of the visual field projection. By these methods, regrowth was found to occur 2 weeks after transection, but the fibers had not yet sorted their retinotopic pattern. Two-dimensional gel separation of labeled nerve proteins revealed 250 to 300 identifiable proteins, 89 of which (including all spots which differed consistently upon direct comparison of regenerating versus normal nerves) were selected for quantitative treatment. Nine of these spots (240, 135, 65, 64, 58, 54, 56, 31, and 26 kilodaltons) were shown to increase and six (56, 49, 42, 29, 17, and 15 kilodaltons) were shown to decrease significantly in regenerating nerves. By using a crush control and tracking the labeled proteins into the tectum over time, these proteins were shown to be axonally transported proteins. In addition, four other nonaxonally transported proteins also changed during regeneration. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A low-molecular weight polypeptide of 30-kD was found to be released into the culture media during the 6-day period of incubation, as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparative electrophoresis of the in situ hypothalamic, neurohypophysis and cerebral cortex homogenates revealed the presence of a 30-kD protein component in both the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis but not in the cerebral cortex. The release of the 30-kD polypeptide into the incubation media indicates an expression of the neurosecretory activity of the peptidergic neurons of the hypothalamus during in vitro maturation. On the other hand, high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection showed appreciable quantities of released dopamine (DA), epinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) in the incubation media in which the neurons were allowed to differentiate. There was a steady release of DA during the 6-day incubation period, varying from 0.21 +/- 0.02 to 0.49 +/- 0.05 ng/mg protein. The epinephrine level increased progressively from day 1 to 6 of culture, from 3.73 +/- 0.57 to 12.08 +/- 1.81 ng/mg protein, respectively. The measured 5-HT level was 0.07 +/- 0.001 on day 2 and increased to 0.38 +/- 0.05 ng/mg protein on day 6 of culture. These data demonstrate the functional maturation of catecholaminergic, serotoninergic and peptidergic neurons in these rotary histotypic cultures of the mouse hypothalamus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Enkephalinase was localized by using a coupled enzyme assay based upon the sequential cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrate glutaryl-ala-ala-phe-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide by enkephalinase and exogenous aminopeptidase M. Enzyme distribution was examined in segments from cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral cord. At all spinal cord levels, enkephalinase was localized to discrete regions of the gray matter. The substantia gelatinosa displayed rich enkephalinase staining which overlapped the inner and outer zones of lamina II. A staining pattern similar to that observed in lamina II was observed in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. In lamina III the enzyme was associated with small and medium-sized cells. Lamina IV showed staining associated with medium-sized and large cell bodies. The medial boundary of the dorsal gray of laminae IV and V had medium-sized fusiform cells which stained for enkephalinase. In the lateral reticulated areas of lamina V, enkephalinase reaction product was localized to scattered medium-sized and large cells compressed against the white matter of axon bundles. Staining in lamina VI was similar in appearance to lamina V. Enkephalinase reaction product was widely distributed in the ventral horn. Numerous ventral horn motor neurons of varied size and morphology in laminae VIII and XI stained richly for the enzyme. The enzyme was also localized to medium-sized and large cells in lamina X and to cells of the central cervical nucleus. The size and morphology of the cell types associated with the enzyme supported a neuronal association for enkephalinase. The regional distribution of the enzyme overlapped that of enkephalin- and substance-P rich regions of the spinal cord. These findings support a role for enkephalinase in the metabolic regulation of centrally acting neuropeptides. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty-six patients hospitalized in the CCU for acute MI were studied during the first 72 hours from the onset of symptoms. Seven normal subjects served as controls. Blood was taken for hormone and B-EP evaluation before treating the patients by opiates. Plasma B-EP levels were determined using the protocol of the Immunonuclear Corporation (Stillwater, MN). Statistical analysis of the results showed: Nonsignificant differences between B-EP levels of all MI patients and control group. Unaltered B-EP levels in patients with acute MI suffering from moderate pain. Significant differences in drop of B-EP in the group with most severe pain (p less than 0.025). A tendency toward decreased B-EP in patients suffering from more prolonged pain (greater than 6 hours).

This protein has been detected with antibodies in all stages of the parasite found in the human host, notably the lung stage, and therefore is of interest as a vaccine candidate. In addition SM23 has been shown to be a member of a proposed new superfamily of membrane proteins whose structures do not conform to the previously known classifications. To date there are 13 members including ME491 (CD63, Pltgp40), CD9 (p23), TAPA-1, CD37, CD53, MRC OX-44, CO-029, MRP-1, L6, the gene product of TI-1, the target of mAb AD-1, SM23, and SJ23 (the Schistosoma japonicum homologue). Most of these molecules except for those in the two blood vessel-dwelling parasites are found in membranes of hemopoietic and/or malignant cells and all have unknown function. In this study we used recombinantly expressed full-length and partial molecules as well as synthesized peptides to map T cell and B cell epitopes of SM23. The two predicted external hydrophilic domains were found to be highly immunogenic and contained several B cell epitopes. There were at least four T cell epitopes in the large hydrophilic domain. One segment of 23 amino acids contained both a T cell and B cell epitope as well as the putative glycosylation site. This particular segment was recognized by immune sera and cells of every mouse strain tested. The elucidation of these epitopes demonstrates the immunogenic nature of this molecule and raises questions as to the role of SM23 in the host/parasite relationship. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Strips from the margins of 16-day fetal mouse lungs, containing future respiratory branches, were cultured in medium containing growth factors plus different concentrations of dexamethasone and/or thyroxine. After 5 days, some of the cultures were processed for electron microscopy and the rest were used to quantitate unsaturated and saturated phosphatidylcholine. In the absence of thyroxine and dexamethasone, the lung tissue developed the equivalent of one more day in utero during the 5 days of culture, perhaps because of residual hormone in the tissue. Thyroxine and dexamethasone in concentrations compatible with normal physiological conditions permitted normal development from the pseudoglandular stage to the saccular stage, differentiation of respiratory cell types, and normal surfactant accumulation. Thyroxine alone gave essentially the same lack of morphological maturation and accumulation of disaturated phosphatidylcholine as culture in the absence of all hormone, but columnar epithelial cells held increased numbers of lamellar bodies. Dexamethasone alone at 10(-6) M gave essentially normal development. Dexamethasone at 10(-9) M was sufficient to permit almost normal development when combined with 10(-7) M thyroxine. We conclude that dexamethasone is required for normal maturation of the fetal lung and that thyroxine acts synergistically to lower the dexamethasone requirement. The presence of apparently authentic lamellar bodies under some conditions of low disaturated phosphatidylcholine accumulation make this morphological criterion suspect as a test for differentiation of type II cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The intercalated duct consists of low cuboidal epithelial cells (375 micrometer 2) surrounded by a myoepithlium, and the cells contain a few small secretion granules, particularly at the proximal end of the duct. The cells of the striated duct are larger (531 micrometer 3), columnal in shape, and show a mitochondrial compartment three times that of intercalated duct cells (16.5% of cell volume). These mitochondria are concentrated in a basal and perinuclear position, but they are largely absent from the apical cytoplasm, which is permeated with microfilaments and contains numerous small smooth membraned vesicles, but no clearly recognisable secretion granules. The lateral plasmalemma of these cells is complexly folded, and basal processes interdigitate with those of adjacent cells. This results in an increase in the ratio of apical to lateral/basal plasmalemma from 1:5 in intercalated cells to 1:24 in striated cells. Some slight changes in cell morphology were detected following isoprenaline-induced secretion of the gland in vivo. These included a small increase in the volume fraction of nuclei and mitochondria in intercalated duct cells, and depletion of their secretion granules. Change in striated cells was confirmed to a small increase in the volume of smooth membraned cytoplasmic vesicles. The structure of the duct and changes wrought by isoprenaline are discussed in the context of the role of the duct in the production of saliva. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two groups of rats began the experiments at 16 months of age. One group (OLD-AC) was given AC, 75 mg/kg/day, beginning at 16 months. The other group (OLD-CON) was treated identically except it was not given the drug. Beginning at 22 months of age, these rats and a group of young (3-4 months old) rats (YG-CON) were given a series of sensory-motor tasks. AC decreased mortality, and had no reliable effect on body weight, fluid intake, or the general health of the rats. These data indicate that a chronic dose of AC does not interfere with food and water intake, and may increase longevity. An age-related decline of performance occurred in most of the sensory-motor tasks; locomotor activity was reduced in a novel environment and in a runwheel, and the ability to prevent falling was reduced in tests on a taut wire, rotorod, inclined screen, and several types of elevated bridges. An age-related decline of performance did not occur in grooming, or in the latency to initiate several different behaviors. AC had no effect on performance in any sensory-motor task. These data indicate that the improvements produced by AC in some tests of spatial memory may be due to the effects of AC on cognitive abilities rather than on sensory-motor skills. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These differences between the two groups of patients were consistent within each of six groups of disease extent. In each of the two groups of patients, the preoperative concentrations of IgG, C4 and C1-INH had no significant variation with the extent of disease (P greater than 0.05 or greater). Of our variables, C1-INH was the most potent prognosticator and discriminated between patients with and without recurrence with 80% accuracy. Furthermore, the predictive prognostic value of C1-INH at the time of surgery was superior to the prognostic value of the extent of disease (F values 27.00 and 12.69). Apparently, the preoperative C1-INH concentration is an essential and independent prognostic parameter of gastric carcinoma. We assume that C1-INH reflects an additional prognostic feature appropriate to the tumour or the host. Our finding that the interval between surgery and death from recurrence had an inverse relation to the preoperative C1-INH concentration also supports this assumption. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The single channel conductance was 23 +/- 1.2 pS (n = 16) with symmetrical NaCl (140 mM) solution in the bath and pipette. The channel was highly permeable to Na+ and K+ (PNa/PK = 0.9) but essentially impermeant to chloride and gluconate. Membrane potential did not influence open state probability when measured in a high Ca2+ (1.5 mM) bath. The channel reversibly inactivated when the bath was exchanged with a Ca(2+)-free (less than 10(-9) M) solution. The Na+ channel blocker amiloride (10(-6) M) applied to the extracellular side of the membrane reduced P(open) relative to control patches; P(control) = 0.57 +/- 0.11 (n = 5), P(amiloride) = 0.09 +/- 0.07 (n = 4, p less than 0.01), however, amiloride did not significantly influence channel conductance (g); g(control) 19 +/- 0.9 pS (n = 5), 18 +/- 3.0 pS (n = 4). More than one current level was observed in 42% (16/38) of active patches; multiple current levels (ranging from 2 to 6) were of equal amplitude suggesting the presence of multiple channels or subconductance states. Channel activity was also evident in cell attached patches. Since monolayers of these cells absorb Na+ via an amiloride sensitive transport mechanism we speculate that this amiloride sensitive cation selective channel is a potential apical pathway for electrogenic Na+ transport in the alveolar region of the lung. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Here we report time-resolved measurements of light-induced proton release and uptake for these mutants. Proton transfers between the protein and the aqueous phase were directly monitored by measuring changes in the bulk conductivity of a micellar solution of bacteriorhodopsin. For the Asp-96----Asn mutant, proton uptake was slowed by greater than 1 order of magnitude with no observable effect on the release step. For Asp-85----Asn, H+ uptake occurred with normal kinetics, but the yield was significantly lower compared with either the Asp-96----Asn mutant or wild type, especially at pH 6. Substitution of glutamate for Asp-85 or Asp-96 had smaller but detectable effects on the kinetics and quantum yield of proton movements. Both asparagine and glutamate substitutions of aspartates at positions 115 and 212 lowered the proton quantum yields. Of these, only the Asp-115----Asn mutant showed an effect on the proton release step, and only the Asp-212----Glu mutation decreased the proton uptake rate. These experiments imply an obligatory role for Asp-96 in H+ uptake in the normal operation of the bacteriorhodopsin proton pump. The results also indicate that the amino acid substitutions affect the kinetics of either H+ release or H+ uptake, but not both. This implies that the two steps occur independently of each other after initiation of the photocycle. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Conflicting results have been published regarding antigen processing of intact proteins by dendritic cells. We now report that highly purified dendritic cells isolated from H-2k mouse spleens very efficiently generated immunogenic fragments of intact hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) protein to present to an I-Ak-restricted T hybridoma cell line, specific for HEL peptide 46-61. Dendritic cells required 100 times less HEL protein than lipopolysaccharide-induced B cell blasts for effective presentation. Uptake of 125I-labeled HEL protein by dendritic cells and inhibition of presentation of HEL protein by chloroquine treatment was observed. This indicates an endocytotic process and the involvement of acidified compartments. Since the supernatant of dendritic cells, that were incubated with intact HEL protein, contained immunogenic fragments, further evidence for processing of HEL protein by dendritic cells was obtained. When HEL protein was covalently coupled to beads, dendritic cells were not able to ingest these beads, but could still process HEL protein for presentation. This suggests cell surface processing of HEL protein, although internalization of HEL protein released from the beads cannot be excluded. Taken together, these data show that H-2k dendritic cells are capable of processing and presenting intact HEL protein. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The coat is composed of a dozen or more different structural proteins. We report the identification of and studies on the regulation of promoters governing the expression of coat protein (cot) genes designated B to E encoding polypeptides of 59, 12, 11 and 24 kDa, respectively. We show that transcription of genes B, C and D is governed by single promoters and that transcription of gene E is governed by tandem promoters designated P1 and P2. In extension of recent work on the transcription of cot gene A and the mother-cell regulatory genes gerE, sigK and spoIIID, we show that genes involved in coat formation are turned on in a regulatory cascade of at least four co-ordinately controlled gene sets. The cascade consists of: cotE as transcribed from its P1 promoter and spoIIID, which are turned on during hours three to four of sporulation; cotE as transcribed from its P2 promoter and sigK, which are turned on during hour five by the appearance of the product (a small DNA-binding protein) of spoIIID; cotA, cotD and gerE, which are turned on during hours five to six by the appearance of the product (sigma factor sigma K) of sigK; and cotB and cotC, which are turned on during hour seven by the appearance of the product (an inferred DNA-binding protein) of gerE. The cascade is hierarchical in that the first three gene sets each contain the regulatory gene that turns on the expression of the next gene set in the pathway. We also show that the level of expression of a member (cotC) of the terminal class of gene expression is strongly influenced by medium and that this effect directly or indirectly depends on the product of sporulation gene spoIV A. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The tumors progress from a hormone-dependent growth phase to autonomous, hormone-independent growth. We studied proviral insertion of MMTV at the int-1 and int-2 mammary oncogenes and the transcription of these genes during progression of a series of transplanted mammary tumors. During the hormone-dependent phase, 6 of 15 transplanted tumors were positive for proviral insertion at int-1 or int-2 or both. These tumors were oligoclonal with respect to the fraction of tumor cells with novel int-1 and int-2 restriction fragments and, apparently, consisted of different tumor cells with proviruses integrated at different oncogenes, including genes that are not yet known. In 10 tumors we detected expression of the int genes, indicating that most tumors contain minor populations of cells with int-1 or int-2 activations. On transplantation the tumors remained oligoclonal during the hormone-dependent phase. The hormone-independent variants of the tumors emerged as clonal outgrowths of cells with MMTV proviruses that could be traced back in the hormone-dependent tumors, but not always those of cells that were positive for insertions near int-1 or int-2. The maintenance of oligoclonality during the hormone-dependent phase suggests a growth-controlling effect of different populations of cells on each other. The clonal, hormone-independent tumors that arise later seem to be the result of mutations that are unrelated to int activation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The assays are based on monoclonal antibodies which recognise trypanosome antigens specific for each of the three species and animals were termed 'antigenaemic' when found positive by this technique but not found parasitaemic by the buffy coat technique. 148 one-year-old animals were exposed to a medium natural tsetse challenge and an average of 6 assays per animal were carried out over a 92-day period. Blood samples were routinely examined 11 times over this period and 28% of animals were detected as parasitaemic by the buffy coat technique. 90% of these were antigen-ELISA positive. More importantly, 40% of the animals with negative parasitological findings were also found to be antigenaemic. Parasitaemic animals with above-average packed-red-cell volume percent (PCV) values had 32% higher daily weight gains than those with below average, while antigenaemic animals showed no significant linkage between PCV values and weight gain. Thus only the 28% of animals with detectable parasitaemias could have been used for selection decisions based on PCV values. Antigenaemic animals grew at the same rate as negative animals and had 22% superior growth rates to parasitaemic animals. When antigenaemic animals were classified as having more ability to control parasite growth than parasitaemic animals, a significant sire effect suggested some possibility of a degree of genetic control being involved. Thus the ELISA could offer a practical possibility for selection of trypanotolerant animals based on infection criteria. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Nystagmus in the horizontal plane is evoked in fish by mechanical stimulation of the ampulla of the horizontal semicircular canal or by electrical stimulation of the nerve from this canal. The movements are conjugate and the slow phase is away from the side of stimulation. 2. Medial rectus motoneurons were recorded from intracellularly, during nystagmus. During the slow phase (induced by ipsilateral stimulation), impulses arise abruptly from the base line and appear to arise at a distance from the cell body. During the fast phase (evoked by contralateral stimulation), impulses appear to arise from large PSPs that must be generated at or near the cell body. 3. In the curarized fish, stimulation of the nerve from the contralateral horizontal canal evokes spikes that arise from large EPSPs and that are blocked relatively easily by hyperpolarizing currents. Stimulation of the nerve from the ipsilateral horizontal canal evokes spikes that arise abruptly from the base line and that are much more difficult to block by hyperpolarizing currents. Little if any underlying PSP is observed when these impulses are delayed or blocked. Thus impulses evoked by stimulation of contralateral and ipsilateral side are initiated near to and far from the cell soma, respectively. 4. If impulses evoked by contralateral stimulation fail to excite the cell body due to injury, antidromic spikes are not occluded. Thus contralateral stimulation initiates impulses in the dendrites. 5. Cell bodies of neighboring motoneurons are coupled electrotonically, and graded antidromic stimulation evokes graded depolarizing potentials which result from electrotonic spread of spike activity from adjacent neurons. These depolarizing potentials are adequate to excite the cells in the presence of a background EPSP evoked by contralateral canal stimulation. In this manner coupling tends to synchronize cells during the fast phase of the nystagmus. 6. Antidromic responses of neighboring cells fail to interact with dendritic inputs to a particular cell, although indirect evidence indicates antidromic spikes invade the impulse-initiating regions in the dendrites. Thus coupling between dendrites is negligible and dendritic inputs can mediate the smoothly graded movements of the slow nystagmic phase. Coupling between somata is too weak to cause significant interaction between dendritically evoked impulses (unless the cell bodies are depolarized by EPSPs). 7. Rhythmic firing can be recorded in a single presynaptic fiber corresponding to either the slow or the fast phase of nystagmus, but not to both. Oculomotor neurons appear to be \"relay cells\" that, during the fast phase of the nystagmus receive a synchronized synaptic input which is initiated in a higher level command nucleus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Dopamine dose-response studies were performed in 7 healthy volunteers before and after sulpiride 200 mg i.v. The same investigations were performed in 15 healthy volunteers after pretreatment with the selective alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (n = 7) and the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor-blocker phentolamine (n = 8). Infusion of dopamine 0.25 to 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a fall in filtration fraction (FF) in 7 normal volunteers. Sulpiride had no effect on base-line ERPF or GFR and did not influence the dopamine-induced renal vasodilatation in those volunteers. It did cause a fall in the fractional sodium excretion (FENa+%) from 1.7 to 1.38, and shifted the dose-response curve of the natriuretic response to a subsequent infusion of dopamine. Sulpiride enhanced the fall in diastolic blood pressure during infusion of dopamine. In 7 other volunteers pretreated with prazosin, sulpiride did not influence base-line ERPF, GFR or FF or their response to dopamine, but the sodium excretion fell markedly (FENa+% changed from 1.13 to 0.63). Administration of sulpiride to 8 volunteers after phentolamine pretreatment 20 mg.h-1 i.v. in the first hour followed by 10 mg.h-1 i.v. resulted in a fall in sodium excretion (FENa+% from 1.09 to 0.53) without affecting ERPF or FF, and it did not affect the dose-response curve in the subsequent DA infusion.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results show that trfA operon mRNA has the same 5' end in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli. The strengths of wild-type and mutant trfA promoters, which differ by defined base substitutions, have been compared and the positions of their transcriptional start sites determined. While these base substitutions do not alter the transcriptional start site, they do have marked effects on promoter strength which are broadly similar in each of the host species. A single base pair substitution, which lies in the region corresponding to the E. coli promoter consensus, brings about a large reduction in gene expression while the introduction of a second mutation, at a locus outside this region, has no further effect on promoter strength. The results indicate that these Pseudomonas species possess an RNA polymerase which recognizes the same region of the trfA promoter as that utilized by E. coli RNA polymerase. Within the limits of these observations it is clear that the trfA operon is transcribed from a single promoter which can function efficiently in diverse species, a property which may be important for its broad host range. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Plasma leucine (mumol/l) was 120 +/- 5 basally and 135 +/- 23 and 129 +/- 12 during the infusion of 3.0 mumol.kg-1.min-1 in groups II and III compared with 40 +/- 3 in group I. Leucine rate of appearance (mumol.kg-1.min-1) was 3.5 +/- 0.3 during the basal period and was suppressed 80% in both groups II and III as compared with 40% in group I (P less than 0.01). Leucine oxidation (basal = 0.7 +/- 0.15 mumol.kg-1.min-1) dropped 20% in group I but increased to threefold basal in group II and twofold in group III (P less than 0.05). Nonoxidative rate of disposal (basal = 2.6 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1) dropped 25% in group I and 55% in group II but did not change in group III. These data show that, in addition to insulin, amino acids and particularly leucine cause a marked suppression of proteolysis. Availability of all amino acids to prevent hypoaminoacidemia is necessary to sustain basal rates of protein synthesis. The infusion of leucine alone resulted in significant stimulation of leucine oxidation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A three-fold elevated plasma mean concentration of apolipoprotein A-IV was found in patients with end-stage renal disease treated by haemo- or peritoneal dialysis (58.5 +/- 18.9 mg dl-1 or 50.5 +/- 12.2 mg dl-1, respectively) compared with the controls (18.3 +/- 6.4 mg dl-1). The plasma distribution of apolipoprotein A-IV was studied in patients treated by haemodialysis and in controls by gel permeation chromatography. In the haemodialysis group, 40.3% of the apolipoprotein A-IV was found to be associated with the fraction of high density lipoproteins, whereas the rest (59.7%) was not associated with lipoproteins. This distribution was significantly different from that in the control group (24.8% vs. 75.2%, 0.01 less than P less than 0.05). The elevated plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein A-IV in the patients are not related to triglyceride levels and therefore are unlikely to result from an impaired catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The accumulation of apolipoprotein A-IV in high density lipoproteins from patients with end-stage renal disease might reflect the impaired reversed cholesterol transport mechanisms which are believed to be a major cause of the high prevalence of atherosclerotic diseases in these patients. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

All IgG subclass fractions contained thyroglobulin and microsomal (or thyroid peroxidase) antibody activity, although when compared to the total serum concentrations of IgG subclasses, IgG4 antibodies were overrepresented. However, in contrast to recent studies, this particular subclass never predominated--IgG4 antibody levels being exceeded by those of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses; it seems likely that these differences relate to varying sensitivity for different subclasses in previously used assay methods. This pattern of subclass activity differed from that of tetanus toxoid antibodies, which were found in six subjects. There was no light chain restriction within any subclass, showing that the overproduction of IgG4 thyroid antibodies is not of monoclonal origin. The functional affinity of subclasses for both thyroid antigens varied between patients, but IgG2 subclass fractions showed the highest functional affinity in the majority of samples. We also found that IgG2 subclass thyroid antibodies were ineffective in eliciting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as distinct from the other three subclasses. Our results show that thyroid antibodies are less restricted in their IgG subclass distribution and patients are less heterogeneous than previously described. Moreover, IgG2 thyroid antibodies are quantitatively important and differ in relative functional affinity and effector function from IgG1 and IgG4 thyroid antibodies. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Electron microscopic studies demonstrate that the fibers and varicosities observed in light microscopic preparations of many brain regions are small-diameter unmyelinated axons and vesicle-containing boutons. The labeled boutons generally contain clear vesicles and one or more mitochondrial profiles. Many of these boutons form synaptic contacts, and the synapses are frequently of the symmetric type, displaying thin postsynaptic densities and relatively short contact zones. However, ChAT-labeled synapses with asymmetric junctions are also observed, and their frequency varies among different brain regions. Unlabeled dendritic shafts are the most common postsynaptic elements in virtually all regions examined although other neuronal elements, including dendritic spines and neuronal somata, also receive some cholinergic innervation. ChAT-labeled boutons form synaptic contacts with several different types of unlabeled neurons within the same brain region. Such findings are consistent with a generally diffuse pattern of cholinergic innervation in many parts of the central nervous system. Despite many similarities in the characteristics of ChAT-labeled synapses, there appears to be some heterogeneity in the cholinergic innervation within as well as among brain regions. Differences are observed in the sizes of ChAT-immunoreactive boutons, the types of synaptic contacts, and the predominant postsynaptic elements. Thus, the cholinergic system presents interesting challenges for future studies of the morphological organization and related function of cholinergic synapses. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Organization of cells in these cultures resembles stratum germinativum and stratum spinosum but there are only a few fully keratinized cells and the stratum corneum is not developed. Since the fully differentiated sheets may offer additional advantages as epidermal transplants, attempts were made to enhance the degree of differentiation in vitro. In the present study sodium-N-butyrate (NaB) was used as a differentiating agent and its effect on the cell cycle and cytoarchitecture of epidermal cells was investigated. Incubation of keratinocytes in the presence of 2.5 mM NaB induced the appearance of enucleated cornified envelopes, covering approximately 70-80% of the surface of the cultures. Their appearance correlated with a decrease in expression of keratin K13, previously shown to be inhibited during terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes. An increase in transglutaminase transferase activity was also observed. The induction of cornified layers also correlated with an increase in the amount of microfilament (MF)-associated actin. NaB also induced changes in the cell cycle distribution of the keratinocyte cultures. A decrease in the proportion of S and G1B phase cells was paralleled by an increase in G1A cells, maximally expressed 30-48 h following addition of the inducer. Interestingly, NaB also induced a cell arrest in G2 phase. These cell cycle perturbations preceded the onset of keratinocyte differentiation. The results indicate that the enhanced differentiation of human keratinocytes in the presence of NaB may serve as a means to produce epidermal sheets with improved properties for transplantation in a clinical setting. It also serves as an in vitro model system to study the interrelationships between biochemical events and cell cycle changes accompanying differentiation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Body weight gain during lactation tended to be lower for cows treated with bST, and body condition scores were significantly lower for those treated with bST and fed the medium energy diets. Daily injection of bST did not change concentrations of glucose or urea in blood or beta-hydroxybutyrate in plasma. Multiparous cows had a transitory increase in plasma FFA concentration immediately after bST treatment started.

All patients had neurosurgical verification of the limits of their lesions. The incidence and severity of constructional apraxia was studied using the WAIS Block Design and Object Assembly subtests, and the Bender Gestalt Test. A uniformly significant caudality effect was obtained with more posteriorly localized lesions resulting in more severe constructional apraxia. A significant laterality effect was obtained on two of three criterion measures with uniformly inferior performance by patients with right hemisphere lesions. The magnitude of the laterality effect, however, was less than that of the caudality effect for all criterion variables. The degree of severity of constructional apraxia in patients with right posterior lesions was uniformly greater than that of patients with other quadrant loci. The incidence of constructional apraxia in the four quadrants varied as expected with the left anterior lesion sample showing very little evidence of constructional apraxia, while the right posterior sample showed a high incidence of such deficits. The absolute incidence of significant constructional apraxia in all samples was suprisingly low. This finding might be partially accounted for by the age and general good health of the subjects studied, the relative absence of general cognitive impairment in the majority of subjects, and the discrete nature of the lesions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

All subjects with ALT values at least twice the normal upper limit in at least two out of three previous checks (the last one not more than 1 month previously) were admitted to the study. Checks were carried out 1, 2 and 3 months after the admission. 59 out of 65 patients completed the study. Although all patients were asked to abstain from alcohol, more than 50% of them in both groups had basal gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) values higher than normal. After 1 month of treatment and throughout its duration, UDCA was effective in lowering ALT in all patients (30% decrease with respect to the basal value) and, especially, in lowering gamma-GT in those patients with elevated levels (50% decrease with respect to the basal value). This decrease was significantly different from the spontaneous 10% decrease of the ALT and gamma-GT levels observed in the placebo group. 3 months after suspension of therapy a rebound of both ALT and gamma-GT to values comparable to the basal ones or even higher was found only in UDCA-treated patients. We conclude that the short-term administration of UDCA is free of hepatotoxic effects and could be useful in lowering ALT and gamma-GT serum levels.

In highly methotrexate-resistant cell lines dihydrofolate reductase synthesis accounts for over 10% that of soluble portein, corresponding to an increase of approximately 100-fold over the level in parental cells. This increase in dihydrofolate reductase synthesis is due to a corresponding increase in the abundance of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA and gene sequences. We have used these cells to show that infection with polyoma virus results in a 4- to 5-fold increase in the relative rate of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis and a corresponding increase in dihydrofolate reductase mRNA abundance. The increase in dihydrofolate reductase synthesis begins 15 to 20 h after infection and continues to increase until cell lysis. These observations represent the first direct evidence that viral infection of eukaryotic cells results in the increased synthesis of a specific cellular enzyme and an increase in the abundance of a specific cellular mRNA. In order to gain additional insight into the control of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis we examined other parameters affecting dihydrofolate reductase synthesis. We found that the addition of fresh serum to stationary phase cells results in a 2-fold stimulation of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis, beginning 10 to 12 h after serum addition. Serum stimulation of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis is completely inhibited by the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP as well as by theophylline or prostaglandin E1, compounds which cause an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. In fact, the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline results in a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis and the abundance of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA. However, in contrast to the effect on serum stimulation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline do not inhibit polyoma virus induction of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis or dihydrofolate reductase mRNA levels. These observations suggest that dihydrofolate reductase gene expression is controlled by at least two regulatory pathways: one involving serum that is blocked by high levels of cyclic AMP and another involving polyoma induction that is not inhibited by cyclic AMP. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The isochromosome is found in skin fibroblasts and bone marrow, but rarely in peripheral lymphocytes. The nature of the isochromosome loss was evaluated using 2 techniques: micronucleus formation for anaphase lag and in situ DNA hybridization for mosaicism in interphase cells. Cells from serial cultured fibroblasts, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and bone marrow from 4 PKS patients were used for the above analysis. Micronucleus formation was similar for PKS and normal diploid cultures, ruling out loss of i(12p) by anaphase lag as the major mechanism of in vitro mosaicism. In situ hybridization using an alpha satellite DNA probe for chromosome 12 was used to examine the presence of the i(12p) in interphase fibroblasts from 1 patient and lymphocytes from 2 patients (age 8 weeks and 1 day). The i(12p) was present in a significantly higher proportion of interphase nuclei in peripheral lymphocytes than in metaphase, suggesting the initial loss of the isochromosome is exaggerated in metaphase by selective division in vitro. In situ hybridization of peripheral lymphocyte interphase cells with chromosome 12 specific probes may be a useful supplemental procedure for the diagnosis of PKS, at least in the newborn infant. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Because of the relatively large numbers of selected samples used for the determination of the patterns of distribution of residual moistures, it was necessary to develop a modified gravimetric method for measuring residual moistures. In the majority of circumstances, with the vials containing the samples positioned on a base defined by cartesian coordinates (x, y) and the contents of residual moistures measured on an axis perpendicular to the base (z), the distributions of contents of residual waters were described best by the equation for a 2-nd order polynomial. It was found that the contents of residual moistures of individual vials were \"position oriented\" and not \"vial associated.\" It was also found that the statistical parameters and patterns of distributions of residual moistures were dependent on: (1) the orientation of openings in the split stoppers used for freeze-drying, (2) the shelf of the freeze-drying apparatus (top, middle, bottom) upon which the vials were placed, and (3) alterations in elapsed times and shelf temperatures. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Intravenous diclofenac 75 mg over 60 min, followed first by an infusion of 5 mg/h for 15 h and then by 50 mg every 8 h orally was administered to 20 patients undergoing total hip replacement. Eighteen patients receiving a placebo infusion and dextropropoxyfen per os served as controls. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups in blood loss, bleeding time (IVY), partial activated thromboplastin time and prothrombin complex assay or in platelet count. The measurements were performed preoperatively, 3 h postoperatively and on the fourth and tenth postoperative days. Plasma concentrations were also determined in ten patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. An i.v. diclofenac infusion of 75 mg over a period of 15 min was administered either once (to half of the patients) or twice. The mean diclofenac concentrations were 28 +/- 5 nmol/ml (+/- s.d.) after 15 min and 36 +/- 12 nmol/ml after the second infusion. The bleeding time in the arthroscopy patients receiving one or two bolus infusions of 75 mg diclofenac remained at the control level. It is concluded that diclofenac given as an intravenous infusion of 75 mg in 60 min, then 5 mg/h for 15 h, followed by 50 mg every 8 h orally, is a safe as dextropropoxyfen for pain relief in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery as far as coagulation data are concerned. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Initial conductance amounted to approximately 27 mS/cm2. In the presence of serosal or bilateral HCO3- (20 mM), it fell to approximately 15 mS/cm2 within 60 min. With mucosal HCO3- or HCO3- -free solutions, conductance decreased to only approximately 23 mS/cm2. In the absence of HCO3-, serosal but not mucosal addition of HCO3- prompted a steep conductance drop that was 50% complete within 6 min. These effects were the same in proximal and distal segments, whereas conductance levels in the latter were higher. The effects of HCO3- required serosal Na+; they were partly prevented or reversed by serosal ouabain (3 x 10(-5) M), furosemide (10(-3) M), and other loop diuretics, and indomethacin (10(-5) M). Serosal addition of prostaglandin E2 (10(-7) M, followed by 10(-6) M) reduced conductance from approximately 22 to approximately 17 mS/cm2. This effect required serosal HCO3- and the presence of indomethacin. 8-Br-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (10(-3)M, serosal side) mimicked the effects of prostaglandin E2. Indomethacin and prostaglandin E2 did not influence the secretory flux of HCO3- (approximately 0.5 mumol/cm2.h, pH-stat method). Our results assign a critical role to serosal HCO3- in the maintenance of a low tissue permeability, dependent on the availability of prostaglandins (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and involving HCO3- access to the cell rather than secretion. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Questionnaire survey of referring clinicians and general practitioners of deceased patients in four districts in North East Thames region. Patients were selected by retrospective systematic sampling of 50 or more necropsy reports in each district. One teaching hospital, one inner London district general hospital, and two outer London district general hospitals. 70 consultants and 146 general practitioners who were asked about 214 necropsy reports; coroners' reports were excluded. Time taken for dispatch of final reports after necropsy, consultants' recognition of the reports, general practitioners' recognition of the reports or of their findings, and consultants' recall of having discussed the findings with relatives. Only two hospitals dispatched final reports including histological findings (mean time to dispatch 144 days and 22 days respectively). 42 (60%) consultants and 83 (57%) general practitioners responded to the survey. The percentage of reports seen by consultants varied from 37% (n = 13) to 87% (n = 36); in all, only 47% (39/83) of general practitioners had been informed of the findings by any method. Consultants could recall having discussed findings with only 42% (47/112) of relatives. Communication of results of necropsies to hospital clinicians, general practitioners, and relatives is currently inadequate in these hospitals. A report of the macroscopic findings should be dispatched immediately after necropsy to clinicians and general practitioners; relatives should routinely be invited to discuss the necroscopic findings. One department has already altered its practice. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

With or without causing a membrane polarization, 5-HT (1-300 microM) depressed synaptic responses; the IC50 was 6 microM. The inhibitory effect was potentiated by the uptake inhibitor fluoxetine. The 5-HT1A/1B agonists 5-CT and 8-OH-DPAT and the 5-HT1B/1C agonist TFMPP reduced the synaptic responses as well, with an IC50 of 0.26, 2.2 and 0.28 microM, respectively. The synaptic depressant effect was not antagonized by methysergide (0.1-1 microM), ketanserin (1-5 microM) and MDL 72222 (1-10 microM). Methysergide alone diminished the synaptic responses in some of the motoneurons. Spiperone (1-10 microM) partially and fully antagonized the depressant effect of 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT, but was ineffective against 5-CT and TFMPP. The 5-HT-induced synaptic depression was not accompanied by a concomitant reduction of glutamate-induced depolarizations; the latter were enhanced after repeated exposure to 5-HT in some motoneurons. Finally, 5-HT reduced the afterhyperpolarization following a single spike or a train of spikes. The results indicate that 5-HT inhibits synaptic responses in motoneurons via presynaptic 5-HT1 receptors, the activation of which reduces the liberation of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters from respective nerve endings. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The 1.6 kb cDNA insert of lambda MC-2 contained an open reading frame that encodes a 418-residue polypeptide (46,970 Da), in which a signal peptide of 21 residues was identified by comparison with the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The predicted structure (MC-2) also contained other peptide sequences determined by Edman degradation. Four potential sites for N-linked glycosylation were found in the molecule, accounting for the difference in molecular mass between the predicted form and the purified protein (63 kDa). Further screening of the cDNA library with an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (510 bp) of lambda MC-2 as a probe yielded another cDNA clone (lambda MC-7), which encodes a 418-residue polypeptide (MC-7) with a calculated mass of 47,010 Da. MC-2 showed 83% similarity at the amino acid level to MC-7, in contrast with 44% similarity to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. The possible reactive site (P1-P'1) for serine proteinase is suggested to be Lys-Ala for MC-2 and Ser-Arg for MC-7. Northern-blot analysis revealed that both MC-2 and MC-7 mRNAs have the same size of 1.8 kb and are markedly induced in response to acute inflammation. Construction of the expression plasmids pSVMC-2 and pSVMC-7 and their transfection into COS-1 cells demonstrated that pSVMC-2 directs the synthesis of a 63 kDa form whereas pSVMC-7 expresses a 56 kDa form. The difference in molecular mass between the two may be explained by the fact that the MC-7 sequence contains three potential sites for N-glycosylation, one site less than that of MC-2. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Our previous work showed that the 110-kDa polypeptide can be divided into three functional domains: a 78-kDa fragment that contains the ATPase activity and the ATP-reversible F-actin-binding site, a 12-kDa fragment required for binding calmodulin molecules, and a terminal 20-kDa domain of unknown function [Coluccio, L. M., & Bretscher, A. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 367-374]. By analysis of limited alpha-chymotryptic cleavage products, we now show that the molecular organization is very similar to that described for the S1 fragment of myosin. The catalytic site was identified by photoaffinity labeling with [5,6-3H]UTP, and fragments binding F-actin were identified by cosedimentation assays. Cleavage of the 78-kDa fragment yielded major fragments of 32 and 45 kDa, followed by cleavage of the 45-kDa fragment to a 40-kDa fragment. Of these, only the 32-kDa fragment was labeled by [5,6-3H]UTP. Physical characterization revealed that the 45- and 32-kDa fragments exist as a complex that can bind F-actin, whereas the 40-kDa/32-kDa complex cannot bind actin. We conclude that the catalytic site is located in the 32-kDa fragment and the F-actin-binding site is present in the 45-kDa fragment; the ability to bind actin is lost upon further cleavage of the 45-kDa fragment to 40 kDa. Peptide sequence analysis revealed that the 45-kDa fragment lies within the molecule and suggests that the 32-kDa fragment is the amino terminus.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Four non-SCC lines were also tested. Radiation sensitivity of individual cell lines was compared using the area under the survival curve (AUC) as a measure of the mean inactivation dose. Tumor lines were tested with either a cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma-irradiator having a dose rate of 100 cGy/minute or with a 4-meV photon beam having a dose rate of 200 cGy/minute. The mean AUC of the 25 SCC cell lines was 188 +/- 7 (SEM) cGy (range, 100 to 250 cGy) whereas the four non-SCC lines had a mean AUC of 225 +/- 9 cGy. The SCC cell lines with mean inactivation dose values greater than 188 cGy were classified as relatively radioresistant whereas those with values less than 188 cGy were considered relatively radiosensitive. In seven cases SCC cell lines were derived from patients who had already received radiation therapy. In four of these cases the tumor cell lines were radioresistant (AUC, 210 to 250) but in the other three cases the tumor lines were radiosensitive (AUC, 160 to 180). Thus, failure of a tumor to respond to radiation did not always select for radioresistant cells. The mean of the AUC for cell lines from previously irradiated patients (197 +/- 11 cGy) did not differ significantly from that of the cell lines from patients who received no prior radiation therapy (182 +/- 9 cGy). However, among radiation-resistant lines those from the four previously irradiated patients were significantly more resistant (mean AUC = 235 +/- 9) than seven other radioresistant lines from nonirradiated patients (mean AUC, 208 +/- 4) (P = 0.0194). In four cases more than one cell line was derived from different tumor specimens in the same patient. In each of these cases the lines from the same patients were similar to one another in their degree of radioresistance. Based on these observations the authors conclude that the degree of in vitro radiation resistance is an inherent property of some squamous cell tumors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The position of gold particles pointed to a localization in the inner membrane/matrix space. A similar distribution was obtained by immunolocalization of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunits RI and RII in liver, pancreas and heart cells. The results indicated the presence of both the type I and the type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in mitochondria of hepatocytes, and the preferential occurrence of the type I protein kinase in mitochondria from exocrine pancreas and heart muscle. The immunocytochemical results were confirmed by immunochemical determination of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase subunits in fractionated tissues. Determinations by e.l.i.s.a. of the C-subunit in parotid gland cell fractions indicated about a 4-fold higher concentration of C-subunit in the mitochondria than in a crude 1200 g supernatant. Immunoblot analysis of subfractions from liver mitochondria supported the localization in situ of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the inner membrane/matrix space and suggested that the type I enzyme is anchored by its regulatory subunit to the inner membrane. In accordance with the immunoblot data, the specific activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase measured in the matrix fraction was about twice that measured in whole mitochondria. These findings indicate the importance of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Of the amino acids tested, L-cysteine was the most potent, inhibiting the response by 42 and 85% at concentrations of 50 and 500 microM respectively. L-Cystine and L-serine-O-sulfate also inhibited the response to norepinephrine, but to a lesser degree than did L-cysteine. L-Homocysteic acid slightly potentiated phosphoinositide hydrolysis at a concentration of 100 microM, but caused inhibition at 500 microM. L-Cysteine sulfinate produced effects intermediate to those of L-cysteine and L-homocysteic acid, having no effect on the response to norepinephrine at 50 microM, but causing 84% inhibition at 500 microM. The D-isomers of cysteine and homocysteic acid were much less potent than were the L-isomers. Examination of the time course of the inhibition of norepinephrine-stimulated [3H]phosphoinositide hydrolysis by L-cysteine showed that it was inhibited almost completely after 15, 30, 45 and 60 min of incubation. L-Cysteine and L-homocysteic acid caused similarly strong inhibitions of the production of [3H]inositol monophosphate, [3H]inositol bisphosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate. The hydrolysis of [3H]phosphoinositides stimulated by norepinephrine in slices from rat hippocampus and striatum were inhibited by L-cysteine to an extent similar to that occurring in cortical slices. These results demonstrate that several sulfur-containing amino acids, some of which have been proposed to be endogenous excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, effectively modulate the response to norepinephrine of the phosphoinositide second messenger system in rat brain. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

When compared at equimolar concentrations, alpha-thrombin, fragment 1.2+ alpha-thrombin, meizothrombin(desF1), and meizothrombin have approximately 100, 100, 10, and 1% activity, respectively, toward the macromolecular substrates factor V, fibrinogen, and platelets. The difference in activity of these four enzymes cannot be attributed to alterations in the catalytic triad, as all four enzymes have nearly identical catalytic efficiency toward the chromogenic substrate S2238. Further, the ability of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) to activate protein C was 75% of the activity exhibited by alpha-thrombin or fragment 1.2+ alpha-thrombin. All four enzymes bind to thrombomodulin, as judged by the enhanced rate of protein C activation upon preincubation of the enzymes with thrombomodulin. The extent of rate enhancement varied, with meizothrombin/thrombomodulin exhibiting only 50% of the alpha-thrombin/thrombomodulin rate. This difference in rate is not due to a decreased affinity of the meizothrombin for thrombomodulin since the apparent dissociation constants for the alpha-thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and the meizothrombin-thrombomodulin complex are virtually identical. The difference in the observed rate is due in part to the higher Km for protein C exhibited by the meizothrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Incubation of the thrombomodulin-enzyme complex with phospholipid vesicles caused an increase in the protein C activation rates. The kinetic constants for protein C activation in the presence of phospholipid are virtually identical for these enzyme-thrombomodulin complexes. These results suggest meizothrombin generation is targeted toward anticoagulant function such as protein C activation, whereas alpha-thrombin generation is targeted toward procoagulant functions, such as fibrinogen clotting, factor V activation, and platelet aggregation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To shed some light on the role of such an interaction in the drug nephrotoxicity, we have investigated the influence of aminoglycosides on phosphoinositide metabolism in kidney proximal tubules where these compounds accumulate. Experiments were carried out by measuring 32P labelling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-P) and of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-P2) after incubation of homogenates of isolated proximal tubules with [gamma-32P] ATP. The treatment of rabbits with neomycin, gentamicin and amikacin (50, 50 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively for seven days) promoted a decrease in 32P-PI-P2 and an increase in 32P-PI-P, when compared to the respective values observed in tubules from untreated rabbits. Under these conditions, the extent of modifications in lipid labelling was similar with the three drugs tested. In in vitro experiments, the exogenous addition of the above aminoglycosides to the incubation medium containing tubule homogenates from untreated rabbits also produced, in a dose dependent manner, a decrease in 32P-PI-P2 and an increase in 32P-PI-P. In the in vitro experiments, however, amikacin and gentamicin appeared to be less potent than neomycin. The results indicated moreover that phosphoinositide metabolism was more sensitive to the in vivo (vs. in vitro) action of the drugs. Phosphoinositides are involved in Ca2+ transport and/or mobilization processes, and aminoglycosides are known to interfere with the Ca2+ binding to membranes.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We designed this study to examine the effect of combined inhibition of thrombin and thromboxane synthesis and blockade of thromboxane A2 receptors in addition to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) on thrombolysis and reocclusion in an experimental canine model with coronary thrombosis. Blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of 32 anesthetized mongrel dogs was monitored by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. Coronary thrombosis was induced by applying electrical stimulation to the LAD at the site where an external constrictor was used to narrow the artery. Three hours after the formation of occlusive thrombus, animals were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: 1) t-PA (80 micrograms/kg + 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 i.v.) and saline; 2) t-PA and hirulog, a hirudin-based synthetic peptide and specific thrombin inhibitor (2 mg/kg + 2 mg.kg-1.hr-1 i.v.); 3) t-PA and ridogrel, a combined thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1 i.v.); or 4) t-PA, hirulog, and ridogrel. Reperfusion developed in 14% (one of seven) of dogs treated with t-PA alone at an average of 86 +/- 4 minutes after treatment, in 78% (seven of nine) of dogs treated with t-PA plus hirulog at 53 +/- 11 minutes, in 13% (one of eight) of dogs treated with t-PA plus ridogrel at 85 +/- 5 minutes, and in 88% (seven of eight) of dogs treated with t-PA, hirulog, and ridogrel at 37 +/- 10 minutes (comparison of the frequency of and the time to reperfusion, both p < 0.01). Among the dogs with reestablished coronary blood flow, reocclusion developed in the one treated with t-PA alone at 36 minutes after reperfusion, in seven of the seven treated with t-PA plus hirulog at 66 +/- 15 minutes, and in two of the seven treated with t-PA, hirulog, and ridogrel at 151 +/- 21 minutes (comparison of the frequency of and time to reocclusion, both p < 0.05). Reocclusion was not detected in the one dog treated with t-PA and ridogrel or in the other five dogs treated with t-PA, hirulog, and ridogrel within 180 minutes after reperfusion. Hirulog prolonged and maintained activated clotting times at a level twice that of baseline values. Hirulog inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, and ridogrel inhibited platelet aggregation induced by U46619, a thromboxane mimetic. Inhibition of thrombin in addition to treatment with t-PA enhances thrombolysis. A combination of inhibition of thrombin and thromboxane synthetase and blockade of thromboxane A2 receptor enhances thrombolysis and delays or may prevent reocclusion of the recanalized coronary arteries. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The latter mainly represent secretory cells and are subdivided into serous and mucous secretory cells. Apical glycocalix: In the rat, ciliated cells possess a significant number of Con A, RCA I, and WGA receptors, and a smaller number of UEA I binding sites. In hamsters and in guinea pigs additional binding sites for HPA could be demonstrated. The apical glycocalix of the non-ciliated cells in the rat evince marked staining with RCA I, WGA, and HPA, and less intensive binding of UEA I. In guinea pigs and in hamsters, the presence of additional Con A receptors was noted. Basolateral glycocalix: The basolateral surface coat of ciliated and non-ciliated cells shows identical lectin binding affinities. In the rat, the basolateral glycocalix binds RCA I; in the guinea pig, in addition, positive staining with UEA I and HPA is observed; in the hamster, the basolateral surface coat is outlined by RCA I and HPA receptors. Secretory products: Secretory granules of mucous cells in the rat react with Con A, UEA I and HPA lectins. In guinea pigs, these substances also bind RCA I and WGA lectins. Mucous granules in the secretory cells of the hamster are positive for Con A, RCA I, and HPA lectins. Granules of non-ciliated serous cells of rats bind Con A, UEA I, and HPA lectins. In the guinea pig, this reaction is weaker for UEA I lectin but comparable for Con A and HPA binding. A positive reaction with RCA I lectin only is found in the serous secretory granules of the hamster. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Our observations revealed that, in numerous areas of the synovial membrane (adipose or fibrous type), the synoviocytes were dispersed and the intercellular matrix, covered only by the cytoplasmic processes of cells deeply located, was in direct contact with the joint cavity. In the areolar type of the synovium the synoviocytes were more numerous; they tended to concentrate to give the appearance of a continuous tissue; but between the cells very large intercellular spaces were usually present. In this latter membrane type we identified the two main cellular types of the synoviocytes: A and B. B-synoviocytes were the predominant cell type of the synovium. These cells were characterized by long cytoplasmic processes, perpendicularly directed towards the joint cavity. Both the cellular body and the cytoplasmic processes were covered by small blebs and vesicles of various size. The A-synoviocytes were a small minority, rarely dispersed between the B-synoviocytes. They were characterized by numerous membrane infoldings which delimited intracellular canaliculi of various depth. Our ultrastructural observations demonstrated that, in normal conditions, the B-synoviocyte must be considered as a constitutive element which characterized the synovial intima, responsible for the specific structure of the interstitial tissue and for the regulation of the composition of the synovial fluid.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The average age of outpatients was 62.9 years with a peak of age of 46% in the 7th decade of life. 60% were male patients, 40% female ones. With about 50% the constant total atrioventricular block was the most frequent indication. 63% of the familiar types of pacemakers were biotronic apparatuses, 36% of them with fixed frequency.

Hereby the biotronic types had the longest average function times of 26.7 months (frequency fixed) or 26.3 months (regulated).

With 5.8% pressure necroses and infections were the cause of complications stood in the second place concerning frequency. The total lethality was 23.7% with an age peak of 38% in the 8th decade of life. 13.4% of the cases of death belong to an early lethality with a prevailing part of epicardial implantations. In our patients the cumulative survival rate was after 1 year 89.3%, after 5 years 62.3% and after 8 years 47.7%. The 50% survival rate was ca. 7.3 years. In comparison to the population of the same age the average expectance of life is transgressed by about 6 years. The prolongation of the survival time by electrostimulation compared with the conservative treatment of the total atrioventricular block with Adams-Stokes-syndrome is the essential result of the pacemaker therapy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Between 1961 and 1973, 68 patients with clinical or pathologic Stage III non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were seen in the Division of Radiation Therapy at Stanford University Medical Center and were treated by high dose (3500 rads or more) total lymphoid radiation therapy only. Of the 17 patients who had a diffuse histologic pattern, the actuarial survival at 5 years was 39%, but only three patients have remained free of disease. In contrast, for the 51 patients who had a nodular histologic pattern, the actuarial survivals at 5 and 10 years were 75% and 65%, respectively. Corresponding relapse-free survivals for patients with nodular lymphomas were 43% and 33%, respectively. Of 28 patients who relapsed with nodular lymphomas, 18 (64%) had relapses confined to lymph nodes; six of these were extensions to previously unirradiated epitrochlear-brachial nodes. Seven of the 18 patients were treated only with further conventional external radiation therapy at the time of their relapses and remain free of disease for additional periods of 2 to 5 years. Hence, 30 of 51 (59%) patients with nodular lymphomas have thus far been controlled by high dose total lymphoid irradiation only. Over 90% of relapses among patients with nodular lymphomas were seen within the first 5 years. The data suggest that high dose conventional radiation therapy to incorporate not only the routine total lymphoid fields but also the epitrochlear, mesenteric, and Waldeyer's ring region has curative potential even in Stage III non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, especially in the nodular group. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The patients were divided into nine groups based on their age; groups A to I consisted of patients aged 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years, respectively. Serum thyroxine (T4), triiodo-thyronine (T3), and thyroglobulin levels were highest in group B (patients aged 10-19 years) and decreased progressively with advancing age. T3/T4 ratio was also highest in group B and decreased progressively with age. These data reconfirmed that the degree of hyperthyroidism is milder in older patients. The prevalence of positive microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies was highest in group B (patients aged 10-19 years) and progressively lower in older groups, suggesting that an association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is less prevalent in aged patients. We suggest that hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease is mild in aged patients because responsiveness of the thyrocyte to the abnormal stimulator, thyrotropin-receptor antibody, may be reduced. Such reduced responsiveness may not be due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, since the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies is lower in aged than in younger patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

After fixation with trichloroacetic acid the gels are stained for 5-10 min with 0.1-0.2% colloidal Serva Violet 17 (generic name: Acid Violet 17; Color Index No. 42,650) in 10% w/v phosphoric acid. After staining for only 0.5-3 min, major zones, corresponding to 100-500 ng protein, are visible without destaining on a weak background. Detection of minor components requires destaining with 3% w/v phosphoric acid for 5-80 min depending on gel thickness (120-500 microns) and type of support (fabric reinforced versus gels backed to a polyester film). For selected pH marker proteins (bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, horse myoglobin) a staining sensitivity of 1-2 ng/mm2 protein is found. Dye elution from stained fabric reinforced gels with 50% v/v dioxane-water, followed by absorbance measurements, results in a linear relationship over a range of 1-100 micrograms marker proteins. Staining with collodial Serva Violet 17 is the only method available for fast and high sensitivity and low background staining of immobilized pH gradient gels, without interference from selective dye binding in different pH ranges. Staining with the collodial dye is convenient by avoiding organic solvents with unpleasant vapors and potentially hazardous. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the study of the Meo and Karen hill tribes and employees of the Raming Tea Plantation living in high land in 1977, high antibody-negative rates against rubella were observed among young children aged 14 or less, so that the antibody was assumed to have been acquired by most of the people aged 15 or over. However, the antibody level in those aged 15 or older differed from group to group. Employees of a tobacco factory and students at a high school in Sarapij were studied. Only two of the 54 employees had the negative antibody. The geometric mean antibody titers were as high as log2 7.081 and 7.058, respectively, which suggested an epidemic of rubella close to the time the specimens were collected. The antibody levels of patients with complaints other than rubella were compared between Chiang Mai and Bangkok in 1977. No significant difference was observed between the two cities in the 20 to 24 years age group but the antibody-negative rate was higher in Bangkok than in Chiang Mai. Serum samples collected from children in the Comprehensive Child Care Clinic, Chiang Mai University, in 1982, 1984 and 1985 were tested for their antibody levels to rubella. The age by which the subject children had naturally acquired the antibody was lower in 1982 than in 1985. The antibody-negative rate of outpatients in Chiang Mai University Hospital in 1985 was definitely higher than that in 1977, and that in 1977 was lower than that of adults in Chiang Mai in 1983 to 1986. These data would suggest that a severe epidemic of rubella prevailed in the Chiang Mai district before 1977, but the disease was not common during the eight subsequent years. Our data in Thailand were compared with records in Japan in 1976. In Japan the antibody-negative rate decreased with age and it was lower than 5% in adults aged 30 years or more. Conversely, in Thailand the antibody-negative rate decreased by 20 to 24 years of age but it was still more than 25% after 25 years of age. The geometric mean antibody titre of the antibody-positive people decreased with age in Japan, but in Thailand it was as high as log2 6.33, even in adults of 30 or more years of age. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cellular mechanisms of such complex spatiotemporal patterns of [Ca2+]i are of interest because they are involved fundamentally in cellular signal transduction in many types of cells. Vasopressin evoked a [Ca2+]i transient even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and intracellular perfusion with heparin completely blocked the response to vasopressin stimulation. Therefore the initial response to vasopressin reflects release of Ca2+ from an intracellular myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ store. We tested four hypotheses on how a localized increase in [Ca2+]i propagates as a [Ca2+]i wave throughout the entire cell: the hypotheses distinguished 1) whether IP3 or Ca2+ is the primary intracellular messenger that diffuses, and 2) whether positive feedback on the release of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) is involved (further release of Ca2+ through activation of phospholipase C by Ca2+ and increased production of IP3 or by Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release). The results of various experimental interventions, which included probing Ca2+i stores (heparin, caffeine, and ryanodine), were compared with predictions from mathematical models for intracellular diffusion, release, and uptake of Ca2+. We conclude that in A7r5 smooth muscle cells, which have been stimulated focally with vasopressin, Ca2+ is released initially by IP3. The localized increase in [Ca2+]i then propagates throughout the cell as a [Ca2+]i wave. Ca2+ activates its own release, through Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+, by diffusing to distant Ca(2+)-release sites. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have linked the tk promoter to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to allow direct measurement of promoter strength by assaying chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activity after transfection into mouse L cells. Putative transcription elements have been identified by deletion and mutation analysis of this promoter. The promoter relies primarily on two \"CCAAT\" elements and a series of \"GC\" elements found farther upstream. Two-thirds of promoter activity is maintained by a construct containing 139 base pairs of sequence upstream of the initiation of transcription that contains only one GC and one of the CCAAT elements. In addition, an evolutionary comparison identifies two highly conserved promoter elements: the -40 CCAAT element and a \"TATA\" element located at -21. We have further characterized both CCAAT elements using a mutational as well as protein binding analysis. From this study we have determined that both the -70 and -40 CCAAT elements bind strongly to the same factor, with a slightly higher affinity for the -40 CCAAT. Competition studies suggest that the CCAAT factor that binds to this promoter is homologous to protein nuclear factor Y, which binds to the major histocompatibility complex class II E alpha gene promoter. In addition, either CCAAT element is capable of supplying almost as much promoter strength as is supplied in the presence of both. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The loss in CaM-stimulated activity was preceded by a transient increase in CaM-dependent activity. Phenylglyoxal was 10-fold more effective than pHPG in promoting the loss of CaM-stimulated activity with a second-order rate constant of 13.3 M-1 min-1. Other arginine-modifying reagents, 1,2-cyclohexanedione and 2,3-butanedione, were not effective. The pHPG-modified enzyme was activated by 100 microM lysophosphatidylcholine to levels comparable to CaM-stimulated activity. The arginyl-modified enzyme was also activated by chymotrypsin and trypsin but not to the extent of the untreated enzyme stimulated with CaM. The presence of CaM during chemical modification with pHPG protected the enzyme from inactivation. Both the extent of activation and the amount of CaM necessary for 50% maximal activation were affected by pHPG treatment of the enzyme. The approximate number of modified arginines estimated by [7-14C]phenylglyoxal incorporation and amino acid analysis after complete inactivation of CaM stimulation was seven residues per catalytic subunit assuming enzyme homogeneity. The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme were unchanged by the modification. These results suggest that arginine residues are critical for functional interaction between phosphodiesterase and CaM and that controlled modification can selectively alter CaM-stimulated enzyme activity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Surveillance for potential reactions involved postcard questionnaires, telephone surveys, reports of Kaiser staff and review of hospitalizations and covered two periods following immunization: (1) the first 48 hours and (2) days 2 through 30. Surveillance for invasive Hib disease involved the above methods in addition to systematic reviews of laboratory and hospital records through January 31, 1990. Rates of local and systemic reactions within 48 hours of vaccination with PRP-D alone were low (less than or equal to 2% for fever greater than 102 degrees F, local redness or swelling) and similar to those previously reported after vaccination with PRP. Hospitalization and seizures (0.15% and 0.09% of vaccinated children, respectively) occurring within 1 month of immunization appeared to be unrelated to vaccination. One 29-month-old child had onset of a fatal episode of Hib sepsis/meningitis within 48 hours of vaccination. Also, a 30-month-old child developed Hib meningitis 10 months after PRP-D vaccination.

To determine if this effect was due to the blockade of the D-2 subclass of dopamine receptors, we investigated the effects of the selective D-2 receptor antagonists sultopride and (-)-sulpiride as well as the effects of the preferential D-2 receptor antagonists, haloperidol and pimozide, on sucrose sham feeding. All four neuroleptics administered intraperitoneally decreased the sham intake of a 10% sucrose solution significantly. The relative inhibitory potencies of these drugs for decreasing the sham intake of 10% sucrose were similar to their relative potencies for binding striatal D-2 receptors in vitro, namely HALOPERIDOL greater than or equal to PIMOZIDE much greater than SULTOPRIDE greater than or equal to (-)-SULPIRIDE. Additional evidence for the specificity of these effects was that the less active isomer (+)-sulpiride did not inhibit sham feeding of sucrose and that a dose of pimozide and of haloperidol which decreased sham feeding of sucrose after food deprivation did not decrease sham drinking of water after water deprivation. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that dopaminergic activation of a central D-2 receptor mechanism is necessary for the positive reinforcing effect of sucrose that maintains sham feeding. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The prevalence of the lesion was 2.4 per cent, with a greater frequency among the elderly and among females, and with a significant relationship to malignant neoplasms. In contrast to other reported series, there was a greater prevalence among cancers of the colon, rectum, and female genitourinary tract. No relationship was noted between the presence of NBTE and exposure to ionizing radiation. Histologic findings in the heart-valve leaflets in close proximity to the verrucae, like experimental studies reported by others, suggest that in association with severe systemic disease there appears a process consisting of degenerative changes in valve collagen and ground substance, with subsequent denudation of endothelium, localized almost entirely to the apposing leaflet surfaces of the left-heart valves. The verrucae of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis are then formed upon this abnormal leaflet surface. While the relationship between systemic disease and the pathologic changes observed in cardiac valve tissue is unclear, and although it is not known whether a \"hypercoagulable state\" may accentuate the tendency for thrombi to form upon these abnormal valves, there is no doubt that this lesion represents a clinically important complication of severe systemic disease. It also seems likely that in some cases NBTE may complicate an illness which may otherwise be curable. Increasing awareness of this pathologic entity among clinicians, coupled with appropriate laboratory techniques, most likely echocardiography, will permit more frequent diagnosis in living patients. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We now show that LPG is expressed in high copy number (6 x 10(6) molecules/cell) in the promastigote (insect) stage of L. donovani but not in the amastigote stage, which infects mammalian macrophages. Detection of these molecules was by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses and by a sensitive radiolabeling procedure. In contrast, a novel family of GIPLs was present in high copy number (approximately 10(7) molecules/cell) in both promastigote and amastigote stages of L. donovani. These glycolipids were purified and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and by chemical and enzymatic sequencing after deamination and NaB3H4 reduction. Promastigotes contained three major GIPLs species with the following generalized structure [formula: see text] where R = H for isoM2, Man alpha 1- for isoM3 or Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1- for isoM4. Amastigotes contained two major GIPL species that lacked the alpha 1-3-linked mannose branch and had the linear structures Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN (M2) and Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN (M3) linked to alkylacyl-PI. The 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PI moieties of all these species contained predominantly C18:0 alkyl chains and C16:0 or C18:0 fatty acids. Amastigotes contained, in addition, a GalNAc beta 1-3 terminating glycosphingolipid with homology to the mammalian para Forssman glycolipid. This glycolipid appeared to be a constituent of the parasite membrane but was not metabolically labeled with [3H]glucose, suggesting that it was acquired from host cells. These results suggest that LPG may not be required for amastigote survival in the mammalian host and that the GIPLs are likely to be major components on the surface membrane in both stages. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Experiment 1 provided evidence that rats were selectively analgesic on retest depending upon the intensity of the heat experienced on the initial test. Experiment 2 showed that this analgesia was recruited rapidly and was long-lasting, as it was observed when retest was scheduled as early as 0.2 and as late as 48 h after the initial exposure to the hot-plate. Experiment 3 documented a role for conditioning processes, as this analgesia was removed by an extinction-like procedure conducted between test and retest. Experiments 4 and 5 provided evidence for a non-opioid mechanism of pain control, because the analgesia was not diminished by the opioid antagonist, naloxone, nor by a history of morphine injections. These experiments also revealed that the analgesia observed on retest was enhanced and reduced when rats were given naloxone and morphine, respectively, on the initial test. Finally, Experiment 6 showed that the analgesia on retest summated with that produced by morphine. The results were taken to mean that the hot-plate assay for analgesia can itself activate endogenous mechanisms of pain control, and some speculations were offered as to how this occurred. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(1987). J. Virol., 61, 1821-1827]. To characterize the level of cellular interference with the SV40 large T antigen (large T)-induced transformation pathway in Rev2 cells, we analysed the biological and biochemical properties of large T expressed in Rev2 cells. We found that Rev2 cells encoded an authentic wild-type large T, with regard to its sequence and its transforming functions. No differences were found in the metabolic stability of large T, or in complex formation with the cellular p53 protein, or in p53 metabolic stabilization. In contrast to SV-52 cells, Rev2 cells showed no association of large T with the chromatin fraction of isolated nuclei. This difference correlated with a reduced affinity of the Rev2 large T to SV40 DNA in vitro. The T proteins from both cell lines were phosphorylated at the same multiple sites. However, in Rev2 cells the phosphorylation of large T at specific serine -residues was significantly reduced. Thus the revertant phenotype of Rev2 cells may be due to an altered phosphorylation state of its large T protein, leading to altered nuclear localization and reduced transforming activity. The alterations of Rev2 large T properties and phosphorylation were very similar to the changes observed with mutant large T in FR(tsA58)A cells, an SV40 tsA58 N-type transformant, when the cells had reverted to the normal phenotype at the non-permissive growth temperature. Thus altered phosphorylation might provide a common structural basis for the biological inactivation of the large T proteins in these cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To study the factors that control migration and maturation of the dopaminergic neurons, we immunolabeled embryo and pups, ages E12-P21, for neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), polysialic acid (PSA) - a polysaccharide found in high amounts on NCAM during development, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) - a marker of mesencephalic dopaminergic cells, and vimentin - the major cytoskeletal protein in radial glia in the rat. At E13, we noted that cells throughout the mesencephalon contained NCAM-immunoreactive (NCAM-IR) material but that cells along the ventral surface of the mesencephalon contained an increased amount of NCAM-IR material and PSA-immunoreactive (PSA-IR) material. At this age, we first noted a small number of TH-immunoreactive (TH-IR) cells adjacent to the marginal zone of the ventral surface of the mesencephalon. Many of the TH-IR cells contained an increased density of NCAM-IR material. At age E14, the pattern of increased density of NCAM-IR material on cells along the ventral surface of the mesencephalon persisted and a conspicuous amount of PSA-IR material was also noted on cells in this region. TH-IR cells were more numerous, and a striking number of the TH-IR cells also contained an increased amount of NCAM-IR material and PSA-IR material. With increasing age the distribution of NCAM-IR material and PSA-IR material in the mesencephalon became more uniform. Our work suggests that NCAM may be involved in control of migration and synthesis of TH in the dopaminergic cells of the developing mesencephalon. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The co-efficient of dilution was calculated to be 0.9. The effect of EO on Escherichia coli endotoxin was investigated by the chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. A solution of endotoxin was dried on glass tubes and exposed to 450 or 900 mg EO/l during 1-46 h under the same conditions as the spore inactivation. The LAL activity of the endotoxin was reduced to about 30%. The EO-treated endotoxin was tested in the rabbit pyrogen test. The summed temperature increase for three rabbits was 0.9 degrees C, while the same assay using untreated test pieces showed an increment of 3.7 degrees C. Administration of the same quantity of EO-treated and untreated endotoxin to the rabbits, as adjusted by the LAL-test, produced the same temperature increment. The addition of polymyxin B (PB) to an endotoxin solution reduced the LAL activity by 75%. Had the endotoxin been exposed to EO, thereby reducing the LAL activity by 70%, addition of PB further reduced the activity by 99%. The reaction of EO on the endotoxin reduced the LAL activity as well as the pyrogenic response and increased the affinity to PB. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Numerical aberrations of chromosome 8 were established by conventional banding techniques. Trisomy 8 was found in four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and three with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Three additional patients with MDS exhibited an extra chromosome 8 in only one metaphase. In five of the seven trisomy cases, the presence of the trisomy 8 clone was confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH). In one case of AML with trisomy 8, detected by GTG-banding, no significant numbers of cells containing three spots were found using the alphoid repetitive probe; however, hybridization with a chromosome 8-specific library revealed that the alleged extra chromosome 8 was a translocation chromosome containing only the long arm of chromosome 8. Due to a lack of material, it was not possible to achieve optimal ISH results on the trisomy 8 bone marrow cells of patient 7. In the three MDS patients with a single trisomy 8 metaphase, a slight, albeit significant, increase of trisomy 8 interphase cells was found with ISH. We conclude that this probe is useful for cytogenetic studies. Moreover, ISH, in general, is a powerful tool for precise classification of chromosomal aberrations and can also contribute significantly to the clinical evaluation of patients with hematological disorders. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

PAF (10(-7) M) induced negative inotropic effect, which reached its peak after 5 min with 23.5 +/- 6.6% in respect to prechallenge values (n = 8). After 20 min negative inotropic effect relaxed to 39.6 +/- 8.8%. 1 min after the beginning of washing in Tyrode solution, positive inotropic effect of PAF was evident, that reached its peak (217 +/- 49.5%) after 2 min, decayed after 5-10 min to normal values. PAF did not modify the resting membrane potential, produced a decrease in the amplitude and Vmax of the upstroke AP, shortened the AP duration. Ca-AP and contractions, elicited in partially depolarized myocardium were decreased by PAF (10(-7) M). PAF-produce the change of the AP and the negative effect on auricle contractile force was inhibited in muscles pretreated with 3mM 4 aminopyridine. Histamine (10(-4) M) was also capable of neutralizing the depressant effect of PAF. The obtained results suggested that PAF effects on the membrane of cardiac cells could be related to a change in Ca and K conductance. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The major findings include: 1) IC neurons in normal adults showed a diversity of perstimulus responses to ICES which were qualitatively similar to those evoked by acoustic stimuli. They responded with: an onset burst, a sustained discharge, a decrease in their spontaneous activity, or a strong post-stimulus response. The excitatory responses showed either a monotonic or a nonmonotonic increase in activity with increasing stimulus intensity. Response latencies ranged from 5 to over 40 ms. 2) Responses to ICES in normal and deafened/unstimulated animals were virtually indistinguishable from one another. 3) In contrast, responses to ICES in neonatally deafened stimulated animals were different from normal and from deafened, unstimulated animals. Their perstimulus response latencies were significantly shorter, their late response latencies were significantly longer, and the frequency of occurrence of inhibitory and late responses were significantly higher. From these results we conclude that the responses to intracochlear electrical stimulation are directly comparable to those observed following normal acoustic stimulation; that development of cochleotopic organization of the inferior colliculus is not affected by the almost complete lack of normal acoustic input experienced by neonatally deafened animals; and that the basic response properties of IC units are likewise unaffected by neonatal deafening. Moreover, the results suggest that, although the limited regime of electrical stimulation employed in these studies produced no major qualitative distortions in the perstimulus response patterns of IC neurons, it did result in some quantitative changes in those responses. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The last 2 eras were combined for analyses of multiple variables. In the analyses of all world cases for the 1984 to 1989 period (n = 1,604), the most important finding was the influence of HLA-DR matching or mismatching on pancreas graft survival rates; 1-year function rates for grafts in recipients matched for 2, 1, or 0 DR antigens with the donor were 73% (n = 52), 53%, (n = 468), and 48% (n = 67) (p less than 0.005 for all comparisons). Likewise, in an analysis of 1984 to 1989 cases according to DR mismatching, the 1-year graft survival rates with 0, 1, or 2 DR mismatches were 63% (n = 128), 50% (n = 583), and 49% (496) (p less than 0.02). An analysis of the 1986 to 1989 era cases worldwide confirms the trend in the period analysis for bladder drainage (BD) to be associated with significantly higher graft survival rates than intestinal drainage or duct injection, at 1-year being 59% (n = 656), 47% (n = 97), and 54% (n = 210). Likewise, for the 1986 to 1989 era, worldwide 1-year pancreas graft functional survival rates were significantly higher in recipients of simultaneous-pancreas/kidney transplants (SPK) than in recipients of pancreas-after-kidney (PAK) or a pancreas-transplant-alone (PTA); 63% (n = 865), 45% (n = 186), and 37% (n = 165). In a new analysis of the United States cases reported to the UNOS Registry from October 1, 1987 through June 30, 1989, 1-year patient and graft survival rates were 91% and 69%.

After the first 7 days of marked sodium retention after creation of the a-v fistula, the animals regained sodium balance for the subsequent 3 wk. This compensatory natriuresis occurred in the presence of significant increases in right atrial pressure and was associated with marked and sustained elevations in plasma ANF and with the return of plasma renin and aldosterone to base-line values. The cardiac reserve for ANF secretion was further evaluated in these dogs with compensated high-output heart failure during additional progressive elevations in cardiac filling pressures induced by 3 wk of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) administration. During the DOCA regimen, plasma ANF increased an additional twofold from its high base line. Arterial blood pressure increased by 6-12 mmHg, and plasma renin activity was suppressed. However, the animals consistently retained sodium, and the high plasma levels of ANF were unable to counterbalance the sodium-retaining actions of DOCA. After termination of DOCA, the dogs exhibited a marked natriuresis, and all the hemodynamic and hormonal parameters returned to pre-DOCA control levels. This longitudinal study demonstrates that the cardiac reserve for chronic ANF secretion is well maintained in dogs with an a-v fistula during progressive cardiac volume overload. The present results suggest that the ANF endocrine system may represent one chronic compensatory mechanism to achieve sodium balance in heart failure when there is concomitant normalization of the renin-aldosterone system.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

With enzyme immunoassays the sensitivity in detecting antibodies has increased compared to e.g., complement fixation tests. This report concerns the determination of virus-specific antibodies with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in paired liquor/serum samples of four patients with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Up to six virus-specific antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes have been determined [herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus, mumps virus, measles virus, and rubella virus]. Additionally, serum samples from several patients suffering, or recovered from, diseases caused by HSV and VZV without CNS involvement have been included as controls. The results showed that besides the virus-specific antibody development (IgG and IgM) against the leading virus, i.e., principally concerned in the disease manifestation assumed to be primarily causing the disease, virus-specific antibodies of the IgG and IgM class against a heterologous virus (e.g., VZV) could also be measured with substantial titers. \"Cross-reacting\" antibodies to both HSV and VZV with the ELISA only appeared and were present in cases where the infection mainly affected the CNS: no such immunological \"cross-reactivity\" was observed in serum of individuals in \"clinically silent\" stages of both HSV and VZV infections. The same situation with no measurable \"cross-reacting\" antibodies was found in cases of acute HSV or VZV diseases where the CNS was not involved. These findings have been discussed with respect to the findings of common antigens, especially between HSV and VZV, and with respect to an unspecific stimulation of immunocompetent cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Assays of activity were performed 20 days after iv inoculation of two clones of the B16 melanoma, B16-H (H-2+, highly metastatic), B16-L (H-2-, low metastatic), or 3LL cells into C57BL mice by enumerating lung colonies. In some experiments, hosts treated with anti-asialo GM1 Ab were used to evaluate effector mechanisms other than NK cells. While the injection of Con A alone had no significant effect on anti-metastatic activity, in nonimmunized hosts the effect by Con A was displayed when the mice were preimmunized with B16-H cells but not in those immunized with B16-L cells. Immunization with B16-H or B16-L cells alone resulted in the generation of killer cells with promiscuous lytic activity and induced an anti-metastatic effect against B16-H, B16-L, and 3LL cells. Con A treatment significantly augmented the killer activity of spleen cells of mice preimmunized with B16-H cells but not of those immunized with B16-L cells. The effectors from mice immunized with B16-H alone or given both Con A and B16-H were mainly of Thy 1+ Lyt2+ asialo GM1- cells, on the other hand, those from mice immunized with B16-L cells expressed asialo GM1 antigen. We showed the efficacy of Con A on the anti-metastatic effect in relation to the host immune response. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Molecular analysis was performed on 25 patients with Ph-positive CML using 2 breakpoint cluster region (bcr) probes within the M-BCR-1 DNA sequences, and two of them did not contain either detectable rearranged DNA homologous to the 5' side bcr probe or ABL-related fusion mRNA. The chromosomal in situ hybridization technique revealed that these two Ph-positive CML cases did not carry DNAs homologous to the 5' bcr or ABL probes on the Ph chromosome. Furthermore, one of the two Ph-positive CML cases did not show either rearranged DNA or regions homologous to the 3' bcr probe on a 9q+ chromosome, while the other CML case showed a rearrangement detected by the 3' bcr probe and transposition of the 3' bcr homologous to the 9q+ chromosome. Thus, the possibility is raised that the BCR/ABL fusion DNA has been deleted in rare CML cases, and that the deletion possibly occurred in a stepwise manner following the formation of the Ph chromosome at any stage of the disease. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In favor of this view is the recently reported expression of such genes during mouse embryogenesis [Manley, J. L. & Levine, M. S. (1985) Cell 43, 1-2]. The embryo-derived stem cells and in particular the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines are generally considered as a valid model of early mouse development. Homeobox-containing genes were shown to be expressed in differentiating EC cells. We have analyzed the expression of several of these genes in three EC cell lines triggered to differentiate by alternative treatments in the presence or in the absence of retinoic acid. In both types of conditions, C17S1 (clone 1003) and PCC7.S Aza R1 EC cells were induced to differentiate into mainly neurones, and PSA-1 EC cells were induced to differentiate into a large spectrum of tissue derivatives. Induction to high levels of expression of several homeobox-containing genes during differentiation occurs only in the presence of retinoic acid. Nonchemical treatment triggering differentiation does not lead to detectable expression of these genes. Accumulation to high amounts of homeobox-containing gene transcripts in these experiments seems to correlate with retinoic acid-induced EC cell differentiation rather than with EC cell differentiation as such. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To test the hypothesis that hypercalcemia or parathyroid hormone plays a role in promoting ulcer disease, we studied the effect of varying concentrations of extracellular calcium on acid secretion using in vitro isolated rabbit gastric glands. Acid secretion was assessed by the accumulation of carbon 14-labeled aminopyrine (14C-AP). Glands were incubated with varying calcium concentrations in the unstimulated state and with histamine or carbachol (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) in 1 or 2 mmol/L calcium medium. The effect of parathyroid hormone was also examined under identical conditions. Compared to 1 mmol/L standard calcium medium, unstimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly inhibited (p less than 0.05) at both lower (0.33 mmol/L) and higher (2 and 2.5 mmol/L) calcium concentrations. Accumulation of 14C-AP in response to histamine stimulation was unaffected by alteration of extracellular calcium (p greater than 0.2). Carbachol-stimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly augmented (p less than 0.01) by an increase in calcium concentration from 1 to 2 mmol/L. The addition of parathyroid hormone (10(-7) to 10(-4) mmol/L) alone or in combination with carbachol or histamine (10(-6) mmol/L) incubation did not alter 14C-AP accumulation. These data suggest that elevations in extracellular calcium play an active role in the potentiation of cholinergic-mediated gastric gland acid secretion and may thereby play a role in hyperparathyroid-related ulcer disease. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The one exception is in spinach leaves where 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase is monofunctional (Nour, J. M., and Rabinowitz, J. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18363-18369). In the prokaryotes examined, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase is either absent or is monofunctional. A cDNA clone encoding spinach leaf 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase was isolated through the use of antibodies to the purified enzyme. This clone had an open reading frame of 1914 base pairs and encoded for a protein containing 636 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 67,727. The percentage identity between spinach 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase and the synthetase domains in the four trifunctional eukaryotic enzymes and the two monofunctional prokaryotic enzymes that have been cloned and sequenced was: 64.9% human, 63.8% rat, 55.6% yeast cytoplasm, 53.8% yeast mitochondria, 47.8% Clostridium acidi-urici, and 47.9% Clostridium thermoaceticum. Clearly the spinach monofunctional protein had greatest homology with the mammalian proteins. The spinach protein is longer than the two other monofunctional prokaryotic proteins. Possible reasons for this are presented. The codon usage and the putative translation initiation sites are examined and compared with other spinach proteins. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Recent prospective epidemiological studies (MRFIT, Framingham) have confirmed the importance of systolic (rather than diastolic) pressure in the development of cardiac failure and stroke, and in all-cause mortality. Arteries stiffen in hypertension and with increasing age. Arterial stiffening increases systolic pressure by two mechanisms. The first is by causing a higher pressure to be generated at the peak of ventricular ejection (through increase in aortic characteristic impedance), and the second is by causing a secondary rise attributable to early return of wave reflection from peripheral sites (through an increase in arterial pulse wave velocity). ACE inhibitors, and also nitrates, decrease arterial stiffness. They also dilate peripheral conduit arteries; this reduces wave reflection. These drugs thus reduce systolic pressure in central arteries not only by reducing arterial stiffness but also by reducing inappropriately early wave reflection. Quantitatively, the latter action seems to be more important than the former. Neither action is seen with beta-blocking agents. These beneficial actions on central systolic pressure are not always apparent when pressure is measured in a peripheral artery such as the brachial or radial. This is because the reflected wave constitutes the peak of the pressure wave in central arteries but is usually just an undulation on the downstroke of the wave in peripheral arteries. Hence sphygmomanometric recordings underestimate reduction in central systolic pressure and in left ventricular load brought about by ACE inhibitors and by nitrates. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Transition duration per se may not, however, explain the fact that, for longer transitions, longer F1 cutback is required in order to perceive a stop as voiceless. Longer transitions result in lower F1 onsets at any duration of cutback greater than zero, and it is possible that the major effect of F1 is determined by its frequency at onset. In this study, F1-transition duration, onset frequency, and slope were varied across four types of F1 transition in which one of the three variables (onset frequency, duration, slope) was held constant while the other two were allowed to vary. Each of the four F1 types was used in syllables with higher formants appropriate for labial, alveolar, and velar places of articulation. By far, the best predictor of identification of these stimuli by human listeners was F1 onset frequency. F1 duration, F1 slope, and place of articulation had little or no effect on labeling boundaries. In a second experiment using Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), birds were trained to respond differentially to voiced versus voiceless stops. The differential effects of F1 onset frequency on the \"labeling\" behavior of these birds was strikingly similar to that of humans listening to the same stimuli. These results are taken to provide strong evidence that F1 onset frequency is the primary determinant of shifts in voicing boundaries across place of articulation, and that general mechanisms not unique to humans appear adequate to account for the effects of F1 onset frequency on perception of voicing for syllable-initial stops. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In view of the suggested application of adoptive immunotherapy we studied the anti leukaemic effects of activated human monocytes and macrophages against U 937 cells in vitro. Purified monocytes (greater than 98%) isolated by centrifugal elutriation and activated with interferon-gamma (IFN) were incubated with U 937 cells for 24 h at effector-to-target cell ratios (E/T) of 0.1-10. We assayed cytotoxicity by relating the optical density (OD) of residual metabolically active U 937 cells after exposure to effector cells to the OD of the initially inoculated U 937 cells. MTT reduction of effector cells was dependent on monocyte activation and differentiation into macrophages but did not interfere with the target cell signal up to an E/T ratio of 10. Improved signals could be obtained by dissolving formazan in DMSO with the addition of glycine instead of using propanol as solvent. Maximum cytostasis (95%, conventional [3H] incorporation assay) and cytotoxicity (80%, modified MTT assay) was reached with IFN activated monocytes at an E/T ratio of 10. In conclusion these data show that the modified MTT assay is a useful method of measuring monocyte mediated cytotoxicity in a sensitive, rapid, semi-automatic manner without the use of radioactive isotopes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has been shown that 42% of these do not fit into the eight conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', VIa, VIb and VIII) as defined by phi, psi limits for residues i + 1 and i + 2. Most of the unclassified turns are 'distortions' of the standard turn types, lying just outside the specified limits. Eleven per cent of the turns are not related to the standard types, and have completely different phi, psi combinations. Therefore, the conformational space available to a trans tetrapeptide has been explored to find all two-residue phi, psi combinations which satisfy the criteria for beta-turn formation. The conformations generated by the search are the conformations observed in the data. On the basis of these observations a new nomenclature is suggested for beta-turns based on a shorthand descriptor of populated regions of the phi, psi plot. For example, it is proposed that a type I turn should now be described as an alpha alpha turn, the descriptor indicating the phi, psi regions of the i + 1 and i + 2 positions of the turn. The use of descriptors, which convey information about the turn type conformation, should aid protein structural workers in turn classification and visualization. The sequence preferences for the alpha beta turn have been elucidated: Pro, Asp and Ser at i + 1; Asn and His at i + 2; Pro at i + 3. These preferences have been explained in terms of specific interactions involving the side-chains. The beta-turn prediction program, BTURN 1.0, has been further developed by alterations to the calculation of parameters, the removal of incompatible multiple turn predictions and the inclusion of the distorted types alpha alpha and beta p gamma data in the respective sets of parameters, to yield BTURN 2.0. A variation of this beta-turn prediction program, called GORBTURN 1.0, has been developed, which uses the directional parameters produced from work by Garrett et al., to eliminate potential helix and strand-forming residues from the beta-turn prediction.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The action of TRH on spontaneously spiking cells was to cause a brief hyperpolarization (first phase action), followed by a period during which action potential behavior was significantly modified (second phase action). The modifications during second phase action included a reduction in the slope of the up-stroke, a reduced peak potential, an increase in duration, and a depolarizing shift of the after-hyperpolarization. The modification of voltage- and calcium-dependent conductances that underlie these changes were investigated in voltage clamp experiments. During first phase action TRH was found to increase calcium-dependent potassium current. During second phase action TRH was found to significantly reduce the L-type calcium current (35%), with no alteration in the T-type calcium current. The second phase action of TRH on calcium-dependent potassium conductance was complex. First, a decrease was observed. This was followed by an increase that did not become fully manifest until after TRH was washed from the cell. TRH caused no change in voltage-dependent potassium current. These results indicate that the second phase action of TRH on action potential behavior in GH3 cells is mediated by a reduction in L-type calcium current and alterations in the behavior of calcium-dependent potassium currents, but not through changes in voltage-dependent potassium currents. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The methodology applied was a survey which was carried out in teaching hospitals in major cities throughout Indonesia. The results showed that although the perinatal health care providers' attitudes toward breast-feeding were very positive, there were many areas in which knowledge was incomplete and in which wide variation existed or incorrect advice given to breast-feeding mothers. The content of advice on breast-feeding was not always sound. Many thought that a wide range of illnesses were a contraindication to breast-feeding, nearly one in five thought that breast-feeding should follow a fixed schedule rather than the baby's needs, and only 54% thought that breast-feeding should be initiated immediately after delivery. Most of the providers did not seem to have the knowledge to cope with the common problem of insufficient breast-milk supply syndrome. Similarly, although support for the concept of rooming-in was strong, about one-third of respondents did not think the mother and infant should be together for the full 24 hr implied by true rooming-in. Fears about the possibility of increased risk of infection with rooming-in were expressed These and other misconceptions about rooming-in imply that a consistent, well-designed training program needs to be carried out in the modern health sector which will provide the necessary information to health care providers about this important aspect of early infant care. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Prepared solutions were examined for clarity and pH throughout a 24-hour period. Clear solutions were filtered and then assayed 24 hours after preparation using UV spectrophotometry. Solutions which formed visible precipitates before 24 hours or which did not demonstrate acceptable potency (greater than or equal to 90%) were assayed after shorter time periods. Dilutions lower than 1:20 (5 mg in 20 ml) resulted in immediate visible precipitates in all four diluents. The 1:20 dilution was compatible with all four diluents and maintained acceptable potency for four hours, whereas at 1:40 dilution (5 mg in 40 ml) diazepam was stable for at least 6-8 hours in the same diluents. At higher dilutions of 1:50, 1:75 and 1:100 (5 mg in 50, 75 and 100 ml, respectively) the injection was compatible with and stable in all four diluents for 24 hours.

Rats suspended for 7 days without inguinal canal ligation exhibited a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduction in testis weight compared with controls (1.55 +/- 0.04 to 1.1 +/- 0.02 g). Except for the liver, epididymis, and adrenals of TS rats and TS rats allowed to recover for 7 days, no significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) change was observed in the weight of other body and accessory sex organs. A histological examination of the testes and epididymides of model animals revealed disorganized seminiferous tubules and accumulation of large multinucleated cells and spermatids in the lumen of the epididymis. A significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) increase in serum luteinizing hormone (53.1 +/- 6.7 to 66.2 +/- 10.1 ng/ml) and follicle-stimulating hormone (257 +/- 25 to 305 +/- 38 ng/ml) was observed in TS nonligated rats, whereas serum prolactin and testosterone levels were observed to decline from 8.3 +/- 1.3 to 5.1 +/- 0.29 and 7.1 +/- 1.3 to 3.8 +/- 0.25 ng/ml, respectively. Decreases in testis protein content and testosterone levels of the testis, interstitial fluid, and epididymis were also observed in model animals. These data demonstrate that the suspension procedure used in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration TS model results in the testis and epididymis translocating into the abdominal cavity, causing cellular degeneration and organ dysfunction. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this study, the effects of the three different CCK receptor antagonists, proglumide, CR 1409 and L-364,718, on basal and stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion were investigated in vivo in the mouse. Each of the CCK antagonists was injected intravenously, either alone or together with one of the secretagogues CCK-8 (5.3 nmol kg-1), carbachol (0.16 mumol kg-1) or glucose (2.8 mmol kg-1). At a low dose level, proglumide (28 mumol kg-1) inhibited selectively CCK-8-induced insulin and glucagon secretion. However, at a higher dose level (280 mumol kg-1), proglumide inhibited also carbachol- and glucose-induced insulin secretion. Furthermore, proglumide elevated basal plasma levels of both glucagon and glucose. CR 1409 inhibited CCK-8-induced insulin secretion at a high (21 mumol kg-1) but not at a low (0.21 mumol kg-1) dose level. In contrast, CCK-8-induced glucagon secretion was not affected by CR 1409. L-364,718 (2.4 mumol kg-1) inhibited both CCK-8-induced insulin and glucagon secretion. In contrast, L-364,718 did not affect basal plasma levels of insulin, glucagon or glucose or those levels after stimulation with carbachol or glucose. We conclude that, of these three CCK antagonists, L-364,718 is the most specific CCK receptor antagonist for studies of both insulin and glucagon secretion in the mouse. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Eighty-eight intrafascicular neural recordings were obtained in 10 normal subjects, 5 patients with axonal degeneration and 11 patients with demyelinating neuropathy. 2. Stimulus levels required for perception and fibre activation were higher in neuropathic subjects. Fibres transmitting touch perception had significantly lower conduction velocities in both patient groups, but were very much lower in the group with demyelinating neuropahty than the group with axonal degeneration. Maximum electrical stimulation evoked dispersed fibre responses in the axonal degeneration group and more dispersed, slowly conducting fibre potentials in the demyelinating group. In patients with hypertrophic Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder, usually only a small group of slowly conducting low amplitude potentials was recorded. 3. Delivery of a train of supramaximal stimuli caused prolongation of latency and dispersion of fibre potentials in all microneurographic recordings. The changes were significantly greater in the axonal neuropathy group than in normals, and recovery was slower. The demyelinating neuropathies showed significantly greater changes than both the normal and the axonal neuropathy groups, and post-tetanic conduction slowing became even more marked after limb temperature was raised. 4. Surface SAP recordings showed normal refractory period in chronic axonal neuropathy but significant latency prolongation occurred in demyelinating neuropathy. 5. It is concluded that both receptor and nerve fibre abnormalities contribute to sensory dysfunction in degenerative and demyelinating neuropathies. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The patients were nine women and two men, aged from 13 to 51 years with a mean age of 25 years. The greatest diameter of the PCNPs ranged from 2.5 cm to 14.0 cm with a mean size of 7.5 cm. Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head. Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass. Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour. Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels. No vascular encasement was seen. Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP. The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis. PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women. Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The mean COHb level was 30% higher in the 248 men who smoked unventilated filter cigarettes than in the 41 men who smoked plain cigarettes, after adjusting for the number of cigarettes smoked (P less than 0.001). This result was consistent with the carbon-monoxide (CO) yields of these cigarettes: on average, the unventilated filter cigarettes had yields 25% higher than the plain ones. The mean COHb level was 7% higher in the 54 men who smoked ventilated cigarettes than in men who smoked plain cigarettes. Although this difference was not statistically significant, it was in the opposite direction to the result which might have been expected on the basis of the CO yields of these cigarettes: on average the ventilated filter cigarettes had yields 21% lower than the plain ones. The medical implications of these results are uncertain. COHb levels of 3-4% or more can exacerbate angina pectoris and intermittent claudication, and it is, therefore, of concern that COHb levels are higher in smokers of filter cigarettes than in smokers of plain cigarettes. However, any assessment of risk associated with either type of cigarette should take account of the observation from other studies that filter cigarettes are associated with a lower mortality from lung cancer than are plain cigarettes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Baroreflexive dysfunction antedates elevation of blood pressure (BP) in some forms of hypertension, and may play a role in their pathogenesis. We studied baroreflex function in seven women with severe preeclampsia being treated with intravenous hydralazine. As indices of baroreflex sensitivity and hemodynamic competence, we measured the reflexive elevations in heart rate (HR) (delta HR/delta BP) and cardiac index (CI) (delta CI/delta BP) in response to hydralazine-induced falls in blood pressure. The change in cardiac index per unit change in systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (delta CI/delta SVRI) served as an additional measure of hemodynamic competence. The results indicated that a higher baseline blood pressure was associated with a dramatic reduction in baroreflex sensitivity (delta HR/delta BP) and baroreflex control of blood pressure (delta CI/delta BP and delta CI/delta SVRI). In patients with higher baseline blood pressures, the severe impairment of baroreflex function eliminated the normal circulatory buffer against vasodilator-induced hypotension. Abrupt and profound reductions in blood pressure and the development of fetal distress in response to hydralazine occurred in the patients with higher initial blood pressures. In addition, the present results suggest that phenomena such as the blood pressure lability and increased responsiveness to angiotensin that characterize preeclampsia are, at least in part, reflections of baroreflex dysfunction. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have cloned the OCH1 gene by complementation of temperature sensitive (ts) phenotype for growth. The integrant of OCH1 gene in the yeast chromosome can complement the ts phenotype and shows the same mapping position as that of the och1 mutation, indicating that the cloned gene is the true gene for mutation. The OCH1 gene disruptant is not lethal but ts for cell growth, and lacks mannose outer chains. The OCH1 gene sequence predicts a 55 kDa protein consisting of 480 amino acids. It contains four potential asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation sites and a single transmembrane region near the N-terminus. In vitro translation/translocation analysis revealed that the large C-terminal region of the OCH1 protein is located at the lumenal side of microsomal membranes with some sugar modification, indicating a type II membrane topology. The OCH1 protein was detected in yeast membrane fractions as four forms of 58-66 kDa, which correspond to the size of a glycoprotein containing four N-linked sugar chains the length of which is almost the same or slightly larger than the inner core (Man8GlcNAc2) formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Finally, the OCH1 gene was found to encode a novel mannosyltransferase which specifically transfers [14C]mannose to the unique acceptor, the core-like oligosaccharide of cell wall mannan accumulated in the och1 disruptant. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Of three tested ECHO techniques for calculation of right ventricular volumes and/or function the best correlations were obtained by the method of evaluation of area-length of the right ventricle from two orthogonal projections (apical 4-cavity and subcostal with visualization of the outflow portion of the RV). The following correlations were assessed: telediastolic volume--r = 0.831, telesystolic volume--r = 0.815 stroke volume--r = 0.810 and ejection fraction (EF)--r = 0.752 (p less than 0.001 for all correlations). The tested method enables us at the same time to screen at least existing right ventricular dysfunction (sensitivity 0.68; specificity 0.82). In the presence of tricuspidal insufficiency (TI) increase in right ventricular function occurs which may mask its existing failure (dependence of EF on the mean pressure level in pulmonary artery was proved only in patients without TI--r = 0.594). We assume that information on right ventricular function is important not only in diseases affecting primarily the right heart but also in advanced stages of left-sided failure. Follow-up of the natural course of the disease and the effect of provided treatment by the non-invasive ECHO method is thus useful not only in research but also in clinical practice. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Because interleukin-5 (IL-5), a potent stimulator of eosinophil growth and differentiation, has been detected recently in EBV-infected B-cells, we hypothesized that some acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphomas with EBV DNA also might contain eosinophilia and IL-5. After reviewing files entered into our archives during the past 3 years, we identified four cases of human immunodeficiency virus-associated, high-grade, B-cell lymphomas that also contained extensive infiltration by eosinophils. Cryopreserved DNA from two of these four cases was available for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, and both cases yielded an easily identifiable, EBV-specific amplification product. From one of these cases we also were able to extract mRNA and perform messenger amplification phenotyping (MAPPING) for the detection of mRNA coding for IL-5. After reverse transcription of mRNA from this case to cDNA and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we identified an amplification product that co-migrated with IL-5-positive controls in an agarose gel. We conclude that some AIDS-related lymphomas are associated with eosinophilia and that the eosinophilia may be related to EBV infection and transcriptional activation of the IL-5 gene. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In pithed rabbits, fenoldopam (1-30 micrograms/kg/min) decreased the arterial blood pressure. Fenoldopam (3-30 microgram/kg/min) also increased the norepinephrine spillover rate (the rate at which endogenous norepinephrine enters into the plasma after having been released from postganglionic sympathetic nerves) and decreased the [3H]norepinephrine plasma clearance. The selective dopamine (DA)1 antagonist SCH 23390 (bolus injection of 10 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of 2 micrograms/kg/hr) antagonized markedly and the DA2-selective antagonist domperidone (bolus injection of 200 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of 50 micrograms/kg/hr) antagonized slightly the hypotensive effect. The increase in the norepinephrine spillover rate was enhanced after treatment with desipramine. Clonidine (0.3 microgram/kg/min) reduced the spillover of norepinephrine, and this effect was abolished by fenoldopam (30 micrograms/kg/min). In pulmonary artery strips preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine, fenoldopam (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) increased the electrically evoked overflow of tritium. The effect of fenoldopam (10(-6) M) was prevented in the presence of a supramaximal concentration of clonidine (10(-5) M). The results suggest that fenoldopam lowers blood pressure mainly by activation of vascular smooth muscle DA1 receptors. In addition, however, it blocks prejunctional alpha-2 autoreceptors at postganglionic sympathetic axons. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In spite of higher average Kcal intake (per day and 100 g of body weight), the rats on the high-protein diet were weighing less than the control animals at the end of the experiment. As compared to the control animals, the rats on the high-protein diet as well as those on the low-protein diet showed a greater relative weight of the thyroid gland. The protein percentage of the body was not significantly increased by an increase in protein supply; likewise, it was not significantly reduced by a decrease in protein supply. The body fat content was by 2/3 lower in the rats on the lowprotein diet than in the control animals. This difference was statistically significant. Thyroid hormones (1 mug liothyronine + 4 mug levothyroxine/100 g body weight, administered orally for 3 weeks) produced a slight increase of body protein in the rats on the high-protein diet; they increased it significantly in the rats on the low-protein diet. Body fat was correspondingly reduced. Methylthiouracil reduces the body fat content in the control animals and in the rats on the high-protein diet; it increased the body fat content in the rats on  the low-protein diet. Our  results confirm the partial findings of human pathology and demonstrate clearly that nutritional diseases, especially protein deficiency, worsen considerably in case of concomitant disorders of thyroid hormone metabolism. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cardiovascular effects of direct microinfusions of clonidine into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in rats of different ages were studied. 2. Clonidine microinfused into the NTS produced a dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardic response, which was reduced by previous microinfusion of yohimbine but not of propranolol or prazosin. 3. Unilateral microinfusion of clonidine into the NTS produced a significantly smaller hypotensive and bradycardic response in 16 month old rats than in 3 month old rats, whereas in older animals (24 month old) the same doses of clonidine were ineffective. In 16 month old rats, yohimbine given into the NTS produced a smaller pressor and tachycardic response than in 3 month old rats whereas in 24 month old animals yohimbine, at the same doses, was unable to change blood pressure and heart rate. 4. Oral administration of phosphatidylserine (50 mg kg-1 day-1 for 30 consecutive days) enhanced the hypotensive and bradycardic response to clonidine microinfused into the NTS in 16 month old rats. The same schedule of treatment with phosphatidylserine did not affect the cardiovascular response to clonidine in young (3 month old) rats and did not restore responsiveness to clonidine in older rats (24 month old). 5. Methoxamine and phentolamine, given intravenously, produced similar pressor and depressor responses, respectively in 3, 16 and 24 month old rats, suggesting that the decreased sensitivity to clonidine in old rats was not due to peripheral cardiovascular changes. 6. In conclusion, the present results indicate that, during aging, there is a decreased sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain. Such an alteration can be reversed by chronic treatment with phosphatidylserine during the initial but not the later stages of aging. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although it is well established that women with multiple partners and early ages at first intercourse are at high risk, less is known about how these factors interact or how risk is affected by specific sexual characteristics. Recent studies indicate that number of steady partners and frequent intercourse at early ages may further enhance risk, supporting hypotheses regarding a vulnerable period of the cervix and a need for repeated exposure to an infectious agent. It is now widely accepted that HPV is the major infectious etiological agent, but whether other infectious agents play supportive or interactive roles is unclear. Of specific interest is the independent effect of HSV 2 on risk, especially given some evidence that this viral agent may interact with HPV. Other speculative risk factors for cervical cancer include cigarette smoking, oral contraceptive usage and certain nutritional deficiencies, but again it is not clear whether these factors operate independently from HPV. Although cervical cancer incidence trends correlate with the population prevalence of various venereally transmitted agents, it is not certain how disease rates are affected by other potential risk factors which have changed during recent time (e.g., exposure to HPV, sexual behaviour, cigarette smoking). In addition, a number of recent studies highlight the need for considering not only female influences on risk of cervical cancer, but also male factors, since the sexual behaviour of the male consort appears to play an important role. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

CMV infection occurred in 18% of patients in the screened versus 38% in the unscreened blood product group. However, only two of 64 patients in the screened group and seven of 61 in the unscreened group developed culture or biopsy-proven CMV infections. Bone marrow donor CMV seropositivity was associated with an increased risk of developing CMV infection (21% with seronegative and 46% with seropositive donor), and CMV infection was not prevented by blood product screening if the bone marrow donor was sero = positive (62% for screened, 42% for unscreened group, p = 0.80). One year survival censored for relapse was 52% in the screened group versus 68% in the unscreened group (p = 0.08). Gram negative bacteremia complicated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 35% of patients receiving screened and 15% of those receiving unscreened blood products (p = 0.02).

All experiments were done in the presence of 1 micron propranolol in order to minimize interference from beta-adrenoceptors. 1. Phenylephrine increased the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects (about 200% of control) occurred at 30 micron phenylephrine. 2. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine. Phentolamine, 5 micron, produced a parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for the PIE of phenylephrine by about two log units to the right. 3. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine occurred without any detectable increase in the c-AMP levels of the preparations. 4. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine developed about three times more slowly than the PIE of an equieffective concentration of isoprenaline. 5. The PIE of phenylephrine was accompanied by significant, concentration-dependent increases in both time to peak force and relaxation time. 6. It is concluded that the PIE of phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol is mediated mainly by a stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. It is unlikely to be related to an increase in c-AMP. With respect to time course and influence on the shape of the contraction curve it is qualitatively different from the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.

H2A.X contains 142 amino acid residues, 13 more than human H2A.1. The sequence of the first 120 residues of H2A.X is almost identical to that of human H2A.1. The sequence of the carboxy-terminal 22 residues of H2A.X is unrelated to any known sequence in vertebrate histone H2A; however, it contains a sequence homologous with those of several lower eukaryotes. This homology centers on the carboxy-terminal tetrapeptide which in H2A.X is SerGlnGluTyr. Homologous sequences are found in H2As of three types of yeasts, in Tetrahymena and Drosophila. Seven of the nine carboxy-terminal amino acids of H2A.X are identical with those of S. cerevisiae H2A.1. It is suggested that this H2A carboxy-terminal motif may be present in all eukaryotes. The H2A.X cDNA is 1585 bases long followed by a polyA tail. There are 73 nucleotides in the 5' UTR, 432 in the coding region, and 1080 in the 3' UTR. Even though H2A.X is considered a basal histone, being synthesized in G1 as well as in S-phase, and its mRNA contains polyA addition motifs and a polyA tail, its mRNA also contains the conserved stem-loop and U7 binding sequences involved in the processing and stability of replication type histone mRNAs. Two forms of H2A.X mRNA, consistent with the two sets of processing signals were found in proliferating cell cultures. One, about 1600 bases long, contains polyA; the other, about 575 bases long, lacks polyA.

Cancer of the uterine cervix, which is the most common malignant disease in Indian women, showed a high frequency (98%) of HPV as compared to those reported from other parts of the world. HPV type 16 was found to be the dominant (64%) type while the frequency of HPV type 18 was very low (3%). On individual typing of HPV, no biopsy was found to contain any other known HPV types under stringent conditions of hybridization except a single case of HPV type 11. Only one case of double infection with HPV types 16 and 18 was recorded. Under low stringency conditions of hybridization with a mixed probe of HPV types 16 and 18, 29 additional biopsies were found to be positive. Southern blot hybridization alone detected HPV DNA in 92% of the cases but none in the controls. By PCR, six (6.25%) more cases and four (18.18%) healthy women were found to be positive for HPVs. Analysis of the physical state of HPV 16 indicated integration in about 70% of carcinoma cases while 30% of them were in episomal form. The findings suggest that infection with HPV is an important etiologic factor for the development of cervical cancer, that a number of such tumours may arise without HPV infection, and that integration of the viral DNA into host genome is not always essential for malignant progression.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We cotransfected this plasmid into middle tumor antigen-transformed FR3T3 cells with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, and G418 resistant colonies were selected. Analysis of these cells for pp60c-src expression revealed that 50 of the 200 cellular clones screened were found to have decreased levels of c-src expression when compared with the parental middle tumor antigen-transformed cells. Three independent clones which transcribed the expected 3.6-kilobase src complementary RNA and had levels of pp60c-src kinase activity comparable to that of normal FR3T3 cells were further analyzed. In the presence of Cd2+, these clones grew significantly slower in monolayer cultures than either the parental transformed cells (FR18-1) or FR18-1 cells transfected with the neomycin resistance gene alone. The morphology of these clones in the presence of Cd2+ was distinct from that of either the parental FR18-1 cells or normal FR3T3 cells. The clones expressing the complementary src RNA were found to form fewer colonies in soft agar, form fewer foci on monolayers of normal rat cells, and form tumors more slowly following injection into syngenic rats when compared with parental FR18-1 cells. The results of these studies suggest that the level of pp60c-src kinase activity affects the growth characteristics and transformation properties of polyoma virus-transformed rat cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ligand-activated or enzyme-assisted trans/cis isomerization of an X-proline peptide bond (where X = any amino acid)--a dynamic, reversible event which could alter the orientation of a transmembrane alpha-helix--may provide the molecular basis for a protein channel regulatory process. Further elucidation of such a function requires knowledge of the isomeric status of the X-Pro bonds in native conformations of membrane proteins. We have used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine the conformation of intramembranous X-Pro peptide bonds in biosynthetically-labelled samples of a model transport protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) (purple membrane). Spectra of 13C-Tyr-carbonyl labelled bR (in the solvent system CHCl3:CD3OD (1:1) + 0.1 M LiClO4) first established that all 11 bR Tyr residues were sufficiently mobile for their resonances to be detected and resolved, independent of their domain location within the bR sequence. By taking advantage of the known diagnostic chemical shifts of the isomers of Pro-C gamma carbon resonances, spectra of bR labelled with 13C gamma-Pro were then used to demonstrate that all 11 bR X-Pro peptide bonds--including those within the protein's membrane domain (Pro50, Pro91, Pro186)--are in the trans conformation in resting state bR. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In this study a worldwide survey on the clinical features of enteritis among 1,455 Austrian tourists is reported. The clinical parameters of TD show that this disease exhibits a very uniform clinical course which is not influenced by different regions with considerable differences in aetiology or by travel-associated parameters such as accommodation, travel style and individual dietary hygiene: TD starts mainly at the end of first week of the stay and the average duration of illness is 3.6 +/- 2.7 days. Watery and mucous stools were reported by 99% of patients with a frequency of 4 bowel movements per day, while bloody diarrhea occurred very rarely. However, 57.2% of patients suffered from abdominal cramps, less than one third of patients reported nausea and/or vomiting and fever accompanied the acute disease in 13%. Symptoms indicate that TD should not be considered a severe disease. The diarrheal illness will show the characteristics of an enteroinvasive disease only in rare cases. Treatment of TD is discussed: symptomatic or other non-antibiotic agents are preferable as antibiotics will only occasionally be necessary for treatment of an illness with a self-limiting character. For prophylaxis of TD, the preferable way to resolve the problem of TD in international travel, very few effective preparations are currently available, emphasizing the need for extensive research in this field. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

During the screening of thrombophilic patients we identified a patient, who was using marcoumar, with 0% PS by monoclonal ELISA and 23% PS by polyclonal ELISA. Further analysis of this patient and his family showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for type 1 PS deficiency and for an abnormal PS molecule (PS-Heerlen) that was not recognized by the S-12 antibody. Similar observations were made in two sisters from an unrelated Dutch family. Subsequent studies showed that PS Heerlen has a slightly lower molecular weight (71,000) than normal PS (73,000), binds normally to C4b-binding protein, and retains full activated protein C cofactor activity. The alteration in the PS Heerlen molecule was identified as a substitution of Ser460 by Pro, which is due to a unique T---C transition in exon 13 of the active PS-alpha gene. The substitution occurs in the consensus sequence for the potential N-linked glycosylation of Asn458. Digestion with N-glycanase showed that normal PS probably contains three N-linked oligosaccharide side chains, while PS Heerlen contains only two (Asn458 not glycosylated?). Segregation analysis in the two original families showed that the presence of the genetic abnormality was always associated with the PS-Heerlen phenotype. The frequency of the PS-Heerlen allele was found to be 0.52% in the general population and 0.67% in a population of patients with unexplained thrombophilia. There is no evidence that the PS Heerlen allele is associated with an increased risk for thrombosis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cord blood MNC were grown in suspension and on preestablished irradiated bone marrow stromal layers, whereas bone marrow MNC were used to initiate one-step long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC). Reduced oxygen tension resulted in a substantial increase in both the number and frequency of colony-forming cells observed in all three types of long-term hematopoietic cultures (LTHC) studied. At various time points under low oxygen, progenitor cell numbers were as much as 12-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold higher for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), and granulocyte erythrocyte macrophage megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM), respectively. In addition to these numerical increases, progenitor cells were maintained for 1-2 weeks longer under low oxygen conditions. Reduced oxygen tension also increased total cell numbers by as much as fivefold in cord blood suspension cultures, but this effect on total cell numbers was less pronounced in cultures containing a stromal layer. The rate of irradiated stromal layer degeneration, as judged by cell counts and microscopic examination, was reduced under low oxygen. Finally, the beneficial effect of reduced oxygen was comparable to the effect of an irradiated stromal layer for maintaining cord blood progenitor cells in LTHC. These results indicate that low oxygen, which better approximates the in vivo environment, enhances the growth and maintenance of both stromal and progenitor cells for a longer period of time in vitro. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the accuracy with which morphologic characteristics will predict the presence and type of HPV infection is controversial. Three pathologists independently classified 102 consecutive cervical biopsies with the use of specific criteria and correlated their findings with the presence of HPV 11, 16, and 18 RNA sequences by in situ hybridization. Based on the presence and distribution of nuclear atypia, abnormal mitotic figures, and koilocytosis, biopsies were classified into borderline condyloma, condyloma, borderline cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with koilocytotic atypia (CINK), and CIN. Two or more observers agreed on the diagnosis in 96% of cases. HPV 16-related sequences alone were detected in 0% of borderline condylomata, 17% of flat condylomata, 43% of borderline CINK, 67% of CINK, and 77% of CIN lesions. Other HPVs, including those producing signals with more than one probe, were present in 0, 50, 14, 9, and 0% of these lesions, respectively. The authors data suggest that consistent identification of HPV-related cervical disease requires the presence of specific cytologic changes. In the authors' series, when HPV-related disease is present, CIN is the most common lesion and most (71%) contain HPV 16-related nucleic acids. Thus, a high proportion (88%) of histologic abnormalities associated with HPV-16 could be distinguished as CIN by morphologic characteristics alone, and this distinction could be made by most observers. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Such use of agonists can be justified on the basis of ideas and equations developed using the occupancy model of drug action. However the occupancy model makes no allowance for possible complications which may arise when the drug-receptor complex interacts with a transducer-effector system. For some receptor-effector systems use of an equilibrium ternary complex model may be better than use of the occupancy model but the former still does not take into account the possible effect of guanosine-5'-triphosphate on the system. A steady-state version of the ternary complex model has therefore been analysed to explore possible interpretations of relative potencies, relative efficacies and apparent affinity constants estimated from concentration-response curves. It is concluded that for agonists which act on receptors which function through G-proteins these pharmacological parameters may depend on the concentration of the relevant G-protein in the cell membranes and on the intracellular concentrations of guanosine-5'-triphosphate and guanosine-5'-diphosphate. If these concentrations vary appreciably between tissues then the parameters are also likely to vary, even for a single receptor-transducer system. It follows that the use of such agonist parameters to classify receptors or receptor-transducer systems is not likely to be totally dependable. It is also possible that agonists which interact with only one receptor-transducer system may show selectivity between tissues with different concentrations of G-proteins and of guanine nucleotides. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Other factors, such as the choice of scan parameters or the analysis procedures, can also introduce variability. The new generation of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has partially improved this situation. The aim of this study was to investigate the operator-dependent analysis procedures that can affect scan results and to evaluate the phantom and in vivo interunit variation of some DXA instruments. Four DXA instruments (QDR 1000 and 1000/W, Hologic, Inc.) were used. Potential sources of variability in the analysis procedures of anteroposterior lumbar spine and hip scans were considered: in most cases these procedures significantly influenced scan results. On lumbar spine, an enlargement of the scan window of less than 3 cm was responsible for an average increase in bone mineral density (BMD) of about 3%. On the hip, lowering the scan window by about 1 cm accounted for an increase in the whole-segment BMD of about 4%. After standardization of analysis procedures, interunit and intraunit coefficients of variation and percentage differences among instruments were less than 1% for all the parameters considered (area and bone mineral content and density) with both an anatomic and a geometric phantom, and in nine subjects scanned by two different devices the percentage difference in BMD was greater than 2%. This study shows that present interunit variability allows comparisons among laboratories, but only if highly standardized analysis procedures are used. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In analogy to other F0-directed inhibitors, DES inhibits both the ATPase and ATP-dependent proton-translocation activities of the purified and membrane bound enzyme. When added at low concentrations with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a covalent inhibitor, DES acts synergistically to inhibit ATPase activity of the complex. At higher concentrations, DES restores DCCD-inhibited ATPase activity. However, there is no restoration of ATP-dependent proton translocation. Under these conditions DCCD remains covalently bound to the F0F1-ATPase complex and F1 remains bound to Fo. Significantly, when the F0F1-ATPase is inhibited by the Fo-directed inhibitor venturicidin rather than DCCD, DES is also able to restore ATPase activity. In contrast, DES is unable to restore ATPase activity to F0F1 preparations inhibited by the Fo-directed inhibitors oligomycin or tricyclohexyltin. However, combinations of [DES + DCCD] or [DES + venturicidin] can restore ATPase activity to F0F1 preparations inhibited by either oligomycin or tricyclohexyltin. Results presented here indicate that the F0 moiety of the rat liver mitochondrial proton ATPase contains a distinct binding site for DES. In addition, they suggest that at saturating concentrations simultaneous occupancy of the DES binding site and sites for either DCCD or venturicidin promote \"uncoupled\" ATP hydrolysis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The exact structure of the oligosaccharide side chain of the glycoprotein may not be critical for this process. We have employed another inhibitor, swainsonine, which inhibits mannosidase II, a terminal enzyme in the protein glycosylation pathway, which results in membrane glycoproteins having hybrid-type oligosaccharide chains and fewer complex oligosaccharide chains. We have examined the ability of cultured rat RPE explants to phagocytize fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled ROS or latex beads in the presence and absence of swainsonine. A significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the phagocytosis of FITC-ROS was found between the swainsonine treated (37.7 +/- 4.1%) and untreated (85.4 +/- 2.7%) RPE explants. The nonspecific uptake of latex beads in both swainsonine treated (85.3 +/- 2.4%) and untreated (89.3 +/- 2.0%) RPE explants indicate that the RPE cells retained their ability to phagocytize. Major differences in spectrophotometric analysis of WGA-stained blots were an absence of a peak at 201 kD, a doublet at 86 kD and an overall reduction in all peak absorbances in the swainsonine treatments as compared to the untreated controls. These results suggest that the alterations in RPE glycoprotein formation due to swainsonine alter the ability of RPE to phagocytize ROS. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By using intracellular recording, miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) were first recorded in a normal [K]o Krebs solution. Subsequently, MEPPs were recorded in high [K]o Krebs solutions with four different Ca concentrations: Ca-free/ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mM Ca. In both the normal [K]o Krebs and the Ca-free-high [K]o Krebs solutions, MEPP frequency was lower at old than at young nerve terminals. In the three high [K]o Krebs solutions with Ca, MEPP frequency was progressively higher at old than at young nerve terminals with higher Ca concentrations. Periodic oscillations were observed in MEPP frequency of depolarized nerve terminals. The period of oscillation was inversely proportional to spontaneous transmitter release. These results demonstrate that when the nerve terminal is depolarized, permeability of the terminal membrane to Ca increases because of opening of voltage-dependent Ca channels. In the present study resting MEPP frequency was lower at old than at young terminals. On depolarization, MEPP frequency became higher at old than at young terminals. The study demonstrates that voltage-dependent Ca entry increases during aging at the soleus nerve terminal. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In the right atria (70% beta 1-, 30% beta 2-adrenoceptors) of all groups except the pindolol group, total beta-adrenoceptor density was higher than in controls. A more detailed analysis revealed that all beta-adrenoceptor antagonists increased right atrial beta 1-adrenoceptor density, but right atrial beta 2-adrenoceptor density was increased only in the sotalol/propranolol group, remaining unchanged in the metoprolol and atenolol groups, and was decreased in the pindolol group. Similarly, in saphenous veins and circulating lymphocytes (in both, the beta-adrenoceptors were almost exclusively beta 2-adrenoceptors), only propranolol/sotalol increased the beta 2-adrenoceptor density, while metoprolol or atenolol did not affect it. Moreover, in the pindolol group lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density was decreased. It is concluded that in man all beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase cardiac and vascular beta-adrenoceptor density, but in a subtype-selective manner. Accordingly, pindolol can be subclassified as a partial beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Our analysis of data on occupational diseases in Germany showed that hepatitis A ranks as third among infectious occupational diseases. Morbidity based on the frequency of compensation (15.2%) was in the same range as that observed for hepatitis B (19.7%). In another study, data were collected on anti-HAV prevalence among 2293 hospital workers in southwest Germany. Anti-HAV prevalence of hospital staff responsible for patient care and that of the general population were comparable, while food-handlers under the age of 30 years had a higher degree of anti-HAV prevalence. When an evaluation of anti-HAV prevalence data was carried out on persons younger than 30 years who comprised subsets of the medical staff, the relative risk was: charwomen 4.2, food-handlers 2.49, and paediatric nurses 1.84, showing that they had higher prevalence rates than nurses 1.25, physicians 1.09 and laboratory assistants 0.93. Vaccinations for the prevention of hepatitis A should therefore reach individuals that have an increased occupational risk: food-handlers, health care workers in infectious diseases and paediatrics, medical staff in laboratories handling stool samples, medical charwomen and, according to previously published work, staff of day care centres and sewerage workers. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The sample was recruited from voluntary participants, two-thirds of whom were aged between 50 and 69. Age-adjusted mean total plasma cholesterol levels were 223 mg/dl for women, and 218 mg/dl for men. Age-adjusted mean systolic blood pressure were 136.7 mmHg for women, and 140.8 mmHg for men. The corresponding diastolic levels were 85.0 mmHg for women and 87.8 mmHg for men. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl) was 32.8%, that of hypertension (greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg) was 32.7%. Age- and sex-specific mean figures and prevalences were lower for total cholesterol and markedly higher for blood pressure as compared with representative German studies. Previously unknown hypertension (greater than or equal to 160 mmHg systolic and/or greater than or equal to 95 mmHg diastolic) was detected in 10%, and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol greater than or equal to 250 mgdl) in 16%. A reply postcard was received from the family doctors of only 11% of participants with elevated levels. This means that the follow-up rate remained far below the hoped-for level. Population screening can be useful in promoting primary and secondary cardiovascular disease by alerting the population to classical risk factors and informing participants about their own personal situation. In order to motivate individuals with high risk factors to act upon this information, screening should be associated with follow-up. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This presents a functional problem for fish with specialized temporal areas such as a fovea--how to reconcile continual growth with the maintenance of a temporal location for the fovea. One possibility is that the retina grows asymmetrically, with most new retina added nasally, relatively little temporally. I have tested this hypothesis by evaluating retinal growth in marine teleosts from 15 families, both foveated and unfoveated. The pattern of growth was revealed by exploiting the fact that each new generation of ganglion cells sends its axons into the optic nerve as a cohort; small grains of the carbocyanine dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine were applied to various sites in the cross section of the optic nerves of adults, and the retrogradely labeled cell bodies in the retina were visualized in whole-mounts. The labeled cells lay in annuli, each one a generation of ganglion cells. Representatives of seven of the families showed clearly asymmetric growth: the labeled annuli were close together on the temporal side and more distant nasally, the embryonic fissure curved from its ventral origin toward the temporal side, and in six of these families, labeled fibers from temporal retina skirted the fovea. Members of the other eight families, without specialized areas, had more symmetric retinal growth: labeled annuli were equally spaced on all sides, the embryonic fissure was vertical, and there were no skirting fibers. The following hypothesis is supported: the retina grows asymmetrically, and maintains the area for acute vision oriented toward the anterior field. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Aggressive treatment of these patients with various drug combinations, unconventional antidepressants, or electroconvulsive therapy has met with only partial success. There remains a pressing need to identify more effective methods of utilizing \"first-line\" antidepressant agents to achieve a more rapid therapeutic action. To this end, we initiated a study using high doses of the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine, at a range of 90 mg to 170 mg daily, in seven refractory depressed patients who had failed to respond to at least three prior treatments regimens. Four out of seven subjects (57%), who had failed to respond to a mean of 8 +/- 5 prior treatment, had a complete response, and one patient had a partial response to high dose tranylcypromine. The mean SD maximum tranylcypromine dose for the responders was 112 +/- 16 mg daily (range 90 mg to 130 mg). Response did not appear to be a function of severity of illness, duration of present episode, or the number of prior treatment failures. Overall, the side effect profile was favorable, and no \"cheese reactions\" were encountered.

Nucleotide diversities among D. teissieri strains and among D. yakuba strains were 0.07% and 0.03%, respectively, and the nucleotide distance between the species was 0.22%. Also determined was the nucleotide sequence of a 2305-nucleotide pair (ntp) segment of the mtDNA molecule of D. teissieri that contains the noncoding adenine + thymine (A + T)-rich region (1091 ntp) as well as the genes for the mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA, tRNA(f-met), tRNA(gln), and tRNA(ile), and portions of the ND2 and tRNA(Val) genes. This sequence differs from the corresponding segment of the D. yakuba mtDNA by base substitutions at 0.1% and 0.8% of the positions in the coding and noncoding regions, respectively. The higher divergence due to base substitutions in the A + T-rich region is accompanied by a greater number of insertions/deletions than in the coding regions. From alignment of the D. teissieri A + T-rich sequence with those of D. yakuba and Drosophila virilis, it appears that the 40% of this sequence that lies adjacent to the tRNA(ile) gene has been highly conserved. Divergence between the entire D. teissieri and D. yakuba mtDNA molecules, estimated from the sequences, was 0.3%; this value is close to the value (0.22%) obtained from the restriction analysis, but 10 times lower than the value estimated from published DNA hybridization results.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ligand blot analyses demonstrated that beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) incubated with apolipoprotein E (beta-VLDL+E) bound to the LRP and low density lipoprotein receptors, whereas active (receptor-binding) alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) bound only to LRP partially purified from rat liver membranes. Iodinated beta-VLDL+E and active alpha 2M showed high affinity binding to the LRP/alpha 2M receptor of low density lipoprotein receptor-negative fibroblasts. The binding and degradation of radiolabeled alpha 2M by these cells were partially inhibited by beta-VLDL+E. Furthermore, alpha 2M interfered with the internalization of beta-VLDL+E and subsequent induction in the cholesterol esterification by these cells. These studies suggested that remnant lipoproteins and active alpha 2M compete for binding to the LRP/alpha 2M receptor. Next, we examined whether the LRP/alpha 2M receptor plays a role, in the presence of low density lipoprotein receptors, in the in vivo catabolism of CR in mice. In vivo studies demonstrated that the unlabeled active, but not the native, alpha 2M partially inhibited the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radiolabeled CR or apoE-enriched radiolabled CR. Likewise, apoE-enriched CR retarded the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radiolabeled active alpha 2M. These studies provide physiological evidence that the LRP/alpha 2M receptor may function as a CR receptor that removes CR from the plasma. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The zero-stress state of each vessel was obtained by cutting the vessel transversely into a series of short rings, then cutting each ring radially, which caused the ring to spring open into a sector. Each sector can be characterized by its opening angle. The opening angle has strong regional dependence. In some regions of rat arteries, the opening angle can be greater than 360 degrees. Rats were studied 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after an injection of 75 mg/kg body wt i.v. STZ. During diabetes development, the opening angles in general increased and reached a plateau in approximately 30 days. The maximum change of opening angle over normal lies in the range of 18-105 degrees, depending on location. The pulmonary arteries were affected by diabetes as much as the systemic arteries. The course of change of the opening angle during diabetogenesis was different from those of the serum glucose level and blood pressure. Blood pressure in carotid, external iliac, and pulmonary arteries did not change significantly in diabetogenesis. To clarify the physiological meaning of the opening angle, we measured the circumferential strain in the blood vessel wall in homeostatic condition and the residual strain at the no-load state, with both strains referred to the zero-stress state. We calculated the corresponding stresses in the vessel wall. The circumferential stress in the vessel wall was greatly increased by diabetes; great errors will result if the opening angle is ignored. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To determine whether NAC could be of benefit in acute bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine, 12 of 24 anaesthetized dogs (group 1) received NAC i.v. (loading dose 150 mg.kg-1, then 20 mg.kg-1.hr-1). The other 12 (group 2) received diluent. Nebulized methacholine (1%) was then inhaled until arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) fell to a mean of 5.5 kPa, after which isoprenaline 0.5% was inhaled in six dogs of each group to reverse bronchoconstriction. Over the next 3 h we measured total lung resistance, functional residual capacity (FRC), haemodynamic variables, and pulmonary gas exchange for respiratory and inert gases. After methacholine challenge, lung resistance increased and then fell similarly for both groups, but PaO2 was higher in the NAC group (by 0.6-1.9 kPa) throughout the observation period. The ventilation-perfusion distribution measured by inert gas elimination also showed less abnormality in the NAC treated dogs over this time. Mucus was visible during post-mortem in the large airways in about half of the dogs in both groups, with no significant differences between them. These results show that NAC produces a measurable improvement in gas exchange following methacholine challenge (both with and without subsequent isoprenaline therapy) by mechanisms that remain to be determined. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7912-7916). This study presents the complete amino acid sequence of these two growth factors and the cloning of their cDNA from rat, mouse, and human sources. Epithelins 1 and 2 are 56- and 57-amino acid polypeptides, respectively, and share 47% amino acid sequence identity with the conserved spacing of 12 cysteine residues. Molecular cloning revealed that both proteins are encoded by a single precursor that contains 7 1/2 copies of this novel 12-cysteine motif, 2 of which represent the known active molecules. Recombinant expression in COS cells demonstrated that the epithelin 1 protein was mitogenic on rodent keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In contrast, epithelin 2 had no activity on these cells, but at high concentrations was capable of antagonizing the growth proliferative activities of epithelin 1. Northern analysis shows the epithelin mRNA to be expressed in many types of epithelial cells. The broad expression profile of epithelin transcripts, along with the opposing activities of the two mature protein products, implicates these factors as natural mediators of epithelial homeostasis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fifty patients with stroke of varying severity were identified by a community-based stroke register and interviewed by two of three research nurses on two occasions that were 2-3 weeks apart. There was no evidence of a systematic difference between the first and second measurements. Repeatability was assessed using a kappa statistic with quadratic disagreement weights (kappa w) to take account of extreme differences. This measure was very good for both Barthel (kappa w = 0.98) and Rankin (kappa w = 0.95) scales. There was also excellent agreement between raters for the Barthel scale (kappa w greater than or equal to 0.88), but some indication of disagreement (kappa w = 0.75) between raters for the Rankin scale. Analysis of variance confirmed these findings. A conversion from the Barthel to the Rankin scale can be derived by assigning the most common Rankin score for the subjects with a given Barthel score, producing a kappa w of 0.91 for agreement. The Barthel scale is a more reliable and less subjective scale for assessing disability, from which a Rankin handicap score can then be derived to enable those managing stroke patients to assess aspects of handicap as well as disability. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Patients undergoing femoro-distal long saphenous vein bypass for critical ischaemia received 3000 ng of iloprost or placebo infused into the graft via an unligated side branch over 2 min. Graft blood flow and peripheral resistance were measured for 20 min, using an operative Doppler flowmeter (OpDop 130, SciMed, U.K.) and a pressure transducer to record graft pressure. Postoperatively, graft blood flow was assessed by daily duplex ultrasound for 7 days. Iloprost produced an immediate drop in peripheral resistance in all cases (n = 18) by a mean (range) of 40% (4-80%) compared with controls (n = 15) in whom there was a 5.3% (-8 to +36%) increase in resistance (p less than 0.01, Wilcoxon test). Decreased peripheral resistance in iloprost-treated patients persisted to 20 min. The largest decreases in peripheral resistance occurred in patients with the highest initial resistances (r = 0.56, p less than 0.02). Graft flow during the same period increased by 52% (-7 to 294%) compared with controls in whom there was a 6% (-17 to 26%) increase in flow, (p less than 0.01). Flow remained elevated by 53% over baseline values at 1 week post-infusion in the iloprost-treated group but this did not achieve statistical significance compared to controls in whom flow also increased by 13%. Iloprost produces an immediate decrease in peripheral resistance associated with a prolonged increase in graft blood flow. This may reduce graft failure in the early postoperative period. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty-six patients had positive cultures and 27 had H. pylori identifiable in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The gastric biopsy specimens from the 29 patients with culture and/or histologic findings positive for H. pylori showed active gastritis in 27 cases (93%), compared with 26 cases (37%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.0001). Chronic gastritis was present in 25 cases (86%) with H. pylori and 40 cases (56%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.01). Twenty patients had positive Gram-stained smears. Fifteen patients had positive 1-hour urease tests, and 3 had delayed positive 24-hour urease tests. There were no false-positive Gram's stain results, three false-positive 24-hour urease tests, two false-negative histologic results, and three false-negative cultures (one inadvertently incubated anaerobically). The sensitivities of the methods were as follows: 62% for the 24-hour urease test, 69% for direct Gram's stain, 90% for culture, and 93% for histologic examination. The authors conclude that the urease test used in this study has low sensitivity and limited specificity; that the direct Gram-stained smear is a useful, highly specific, rapid screening test; and that the lengthier methods of culture and histologic examination have comparably high sensitivity for the definitive diagnosis of H. pylori gastritis. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Desflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia decreased systemic blood pressures, cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index, and increased pulmonary arterial pressures and central venous pressure in a dose-dependent fashion, while heart rate was 10%-12% and mixed venous oxygen tension was 2-4 mm Hg higher at all MAC levels than at baseline (awake). Desflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia modestly increased left ventricular end-diastolic cross-sectional area (preload) and decreased velocity of left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening, systolic wall stress (afterload), and area ejection fraction; this combination of changes indicates myocardial depression. At approximately comparable MAC levels, heart rate was lower and systemic blood pressures, central venous pressure, left ventricular stroke work index, and systemic vascular resistance usually were significantly higher during anesthesia with desflurane and nitrous oxide than during desflurane anesthesia alone (same volunteers, data collected in crossover design). After 7 h of anesthesia, regardless of the background gas, somewhat less cardiovascular depression and/or modest stimulation was apparent: cardiac index, area ejection fraction, and velocity of left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening recovered to or toward awake values, whereas heart rate was further increased. Evidence of circulatory insufficiency did not develop in any volunteers during the study.

The latter enzyme system could not be detected in skeletal muscle. Clofibrate treatment resulted in an enhancement of peroxisomal beta-oxidizing capacity in various tissues. Intact mitochondria from control rat liver and kidney cortex incubated in the presence of L-carnitine were capable of oxidizing long-chain monocarboxylyl-CoAs and omega-hydroxymonocarboxylyl-CoAs but not dicarboxylyl-CoAs. However, control rat liver mitochondria permeabilized by digitonin oxidized dodecanedioyl-CoA indicating that the liver mitochondrial beta-oxidation system can act on dicarboxylyl-CoA esters even if the overall intact mitochondrial system is inactive on these substrates. Intact liver mitochondria from clofibrate-treated animals rapidly oxidized lauroyl-CoA and 12-hydroxylauroyl-CoA but not dodecanedioyl-CoA. These mitochondria were active on hexadecanedioyl-CoA and this activity amounted to 20-25% of that measured with palmitoyl-CoA and 16-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA as substrates. No mitochondrial dicarboxylyl-CoA oxidation could be detected in kidney cortex from animals receiving clofibrate in their diet. Heart and skeletal muscle intact mitochondria from untreated and clofibrate-treated rats were capable of oxidizing each type of acyl-CoA as a substrate. Dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase and carnitine dicarboxylyltransferase activities were detected in various tissues from untreated and clofibrate-treated rats with the exception of carnitine dodecanedioyltransferase reaction in livers from untreated and clofibrate-treated rats.

In the present study the intracerebral microdialysis technique has been used to monitor seizure-induced release of noradrenaline from such grafts. The steady-state output of noradrenaline in the hippocampus of grafted animals (previously treated with intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine) was similar to the baseline level in normal rats. A generalized seizure gave rise to a threefold increase of hippocampal noradrenaline levels as compared to baseline (15-min samples) in both normal and grafted animals. The maximal increase of extracellular noradrenaline levels occurred within 2-4 min after the onset of seizure activity and the levels then tapered off, reaching baseline after another 6-8 min. In 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals without grafts baseline noradrenaline levels were markedly reduced compared to those of normal rats and only minor changes were observed in response to seizures. This supports the theory that the high extracellular noradrenaline concentrations measured in conjunction with seizures originate from the grafts. A knife cut transecting the ascending bundle from the locus coeruleus led to a marked attenuation of the seizure-induced increase of noradrenaline release in normal animals. In the intact brain, and probably also in the grafts, this response thus seems to be dependent on impulse flow in locus coeruleus neurons and only to a minor extent on local regulatory mechanisms in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that grafted locus coeruleus neurons are able to restore both basal and seizure-induced extracellular noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Resting values for rectal temperature (RT), in ambient temperatures of 22-24 degrees C, were significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in SHR than in WKY rats, under both restrained (39.19 +/- 0.07 vs. 38.01 +/- 0.06 degrees C) and freely moving (39.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 38.08 +/- 0.06 degrees C) conditions. Resting RT did not differ between restrained and freely moving conditions within a strain. An heterogeneity of RT response to both IV and IP cocaine was expressed by restraint in SHR. The SHR could be divided into animals which demonstrated hyperthermia to cocaine (SHRH) and those in which RT fell (SHRL) . However, cocaine produced hyperthermia in all freely moving SHR, regardless of the route of administration. The effects of IV cocaine in restrained WKY rats were similar to those in freely moving SHR, whereas IP cocaine decreased RT in all restrained WKY rats. Under conditions of restraint, divergent RT responses to cocaine were demonstrated following IV and IP administration in WKY rats, but not in SHR. These results indicate that restraint stress can significantly modify the body temperature responses to acute cocaine administration in both SHR and WKY rats. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Similar to the action of DA, the DA D-1 receptor agonist (+)SKF-38393 generally potentiated the activation produced by glutamate (GLU) at low ejection currents (less than or equal to 5 nA); at higher ejection currents, it depressed 97% of the CPu neurons tested. By contrast, the D-2 receptor agonist LY-171555 (quinpirole) was much less effective in affecting the firing rate of CPu cells. The selective D-1 antagonist SCH-23390, administered either intravenously or iontophoretically, completely blocked the (+)SKF-38393-induced effects on CPu cells but failed to change the depressant effects produced by either quinpirole or 5-HT. On the other hand, the selective D-2 antagonist I-sulpiride, blocked the effects induced by quinpirole but not (+)SKF-38393. These observations suggest that the D-1 and D-2 DA receptor agonists elicit their effects via distinct DA receptor subtypes. A comparison of these results with our previous results obtained from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) indicates that NAc cells are more responsive to DA D-2 agonist, whereas CPu cells are more sensitive to D-1 agonist. Therefore, D-1 receptors in the CPu may have a critical role in mediating the effect produced by DA.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This increase in mass is mediated by an increase in the total mass of the myocytes and the total mass of interstitial fibrous connective tissue. The increase in myocyte mass is the most important of these two components. However, it is not clear at the present time whether this increase is mediated not only by an increase in the size of the cells (hypertrophy), but also by an increase in the numbers of myocytes (hyperplasia) or by a combination of these two factors. Hyperplasia normally occurs during the prenatal phase of cardiac development and stops soon after birth, at which time hypertrophy becomes the main mechanism by which cardiac mass increases. Under certain circumstances, the ability of cardiac myocytes to synthesize DNA and undergo mitotic division can be restored; however, it is uncertain to what extent this results in complete cell division or only in either polyploidy or bi- or multinucleation. It is proposed that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased hyperplasia of cardiac myocytes occurs early in life and leads to permanently disturbed patterns of cardiac gross anatomy; it is then followed by a phase of progressive hypertrophy after the switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth. It is possible that hyperplasia continues to occur after the usual time of this switch. It is also proposed that the increased number of layers of myocytes in the ventricular septum of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a consequence of exaggerated hyperplasia during development. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

One thousand sixty-two relatives of hospitalized alcoholics, felons, and control subjects were administered a structured interview that gathered data on lifetime psychiatric symptoms and psychoactive drug use. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on interview information, medical records, and family history data. Comparisons were made between 411 subjects who used no illicit drugs, 329 cannabis users, 230 subjects who had used psychoactive drugs other than cannabis more than five times but had never injected drugs, and 92 intravenous drug users. Any history of injecting drugs increased the odds of being diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder by a factor of 21.01, alcoholism by 4.42, and unipolar depression by 3.02. A diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder increased the odds of having injected drugs by a factor of 27.19, while diagnoses of alcoholism or unipolar depression conveyed odds for injecting drugs of 4.62 and 3.70, respectively. Intravenous drug use was associated with an 8.27-fold increase in odds for a suicide attempt compared with no drug use. Rates of alcoholism, depression, and antisocial personality disorder, but not other psychiatric disorders (other than drug dependence), are significantly elevated in intravenous drug users. Moreover, among drug users, the decision to inject is differentially made by those with antisocial personality disorder. A history of suicide attempt is common among intravenous drug users, but injecting appears to convey little additional risk above substantial but non-intravenous drug use. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Most studies performed so far have relied on normal non-concussed control subjects rather than directly comparing patients with and without PCS following MHI. In addition, subtle cognitive deficits may be present in MHI patients that are demonstrable only with more demanding cognitive tasks. In the present study the Stroop Color Word Interference Test together with a more demanding modified interference subtask was administered to two groups of patients with uncomplicated MHI 10 days, 5 weeks and 3 months after the injury. Ten patients with persistent symptoms at 3 months were selected and individually matched with MHI patients who had initially reported symptoms but who had recovered by 3 months. The scores of the two retrospectively defined groups were compared at the different time points. Between-subjects analysis revealed overall differences for both the original and modified color word interference subtask. Within-subject analysis indicated that only the recovery rate in the modified interference subtask was significantly different between the two groups. The observation that there was a parallel trend between recovery and persistence of PCS and performance on the cognitive interference measures supports the notion that there is a functional relationship between these two phenomena. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Metals (Fe, Cr, Ni) introduced by inhaled waste particles were found in the increased amount in the body organs of exposed (P and F1) animals. Following a 3-months exposure of female rabbits (P), the elevated level of Cr in liver and kidneys was found, and after 6-month exposure also in the heart and thigh muscles. The Ni content proved to be increased in the lungs, heart and thigh muscles following 3-month period and in the liver after the 6-month exposure. Concerning the Fe content, it was already elevated in all the organs investigated except the lungs after 3-month exposure. The alveolar macrophage (AM) count was increased significantly in the exposed female rabbits (P) only after 6 months (P less than 0.05) and rose continually till the end of 9-month exposure (P less than 0.01). The enzyme activity of lysosomes was enhanced after 9-month exposure. In F1 rabbits 6 weeks of age elevated levels of chromium were found in the liver, kidneys, heart and thigh muscles. The Fe content was increased in the liver and thigh muscle, while the Ni content was enhanced only in the brain. The increased mucus secretion was observed on the tracheal mucous relief of F1 rabbits in response to the noxious effect of needle-shaped metal particles using an electron scanning microscope, despite the short duration (6 weeks) of postnatal exposure.

In the present study, the inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.12) by onion and garlic components and related compounds was investigated. The IC50 values as well as the kinetic inhibition constants were determined for the most active compounds. Di-(1-propenyl) sulfide, an analog of the substrate moiety required for oxygenase action, was the only irreversible inhibitor observed with Ki = 59 microM and k3 = 0.53/min. Inhibition in the presence of substrate was uncompetitive at 88 and 132 microM linoleic acid with Ki = 129 microM. At 173 microM linoleic acid, however, inhibition was competitive with Ki = 66 microM. Dially trisulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, and diallyl disulfide were competitive inhibitors, while 1-propenylpropyl sulfide and (E, Z)-4,5,9-trithiadodeca-1,6,11-triene 9-oxide (ajoene) were mixed inhibitors. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the most potent lipoxygenase inhibitor, was a competitive inhibitor with Ki = 0.29 microM. The results indicate a relative potency of inhibition for structural features in the following order: di(1-propenyl) sulfide greater than an alkenyl trisulfide greater than an alkenyl disulfide. Di(n-propyl) disulfide, a major onion oil component, inhibited neither lipoxygenase nor promotion. Di(1-propenyl) sulfide and ajoene inhibited both.

DAG is necessary for the activation and function of protein kinase C (PKC) which is suggested to play a key role in the cascade of signal transduction when translocated from the cytosol to the cell membrane. In this report, we investigated responses of resting vs. activated Ly-2+ and L3T4+ T lymphocytes in the presence of the PKC inhibitor H7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine]. H7 inhibited the induction of primary T cell proliferation, while interleukin 2 (IL 2) production was fully retained. The effect of the PKC inhibitor on primary T cells depended on the type of ligand interacting with the TcR: increasing doses of concanavalin A or of immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not of anti-V beta 8 or of anti-TcR alpha/beta mAb, partly overcame the blockade, indicating a differential signaling compared to the former stimuli. The blockade of T cell proliferation by H7 was not due to an inhibition of PKC translocation, but occurred even 4-8 h after T cell induction and correlated with a significant reduction of IL 2 receptor (IL 2R) expression. In contrast, the mRNA levels of IL 2R and the cellular proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc were not affected. On activated T cells, H7 neither blocked proliferation nor IL2R expression. Consequently, H7 dissects the signal resulting in T cell proliferation from those governing the triggering of other T cell functions, i.e. IL 2 production, during primary responses of Ly-2+ or L3T4+ murine T lymphocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Relationship between these three biochemical parameters in both S and CSF and also between these latter 15 studies FFA serum concentration of neonates (n: 9) with TB less than 2 mg/dl - 70.15 (15.63) (+/- SEM) mg/l - was not statistically different from those calculated in CSF - 67.45 (13.80) mg/l - (p: NS): while newborn infants (n: 17) with TB greater than 2 mg/dl had FFA serum levels - 152.75 (22.84) less than 0.002). There was a positive correlation between TB and FFA in S (n: 26, r: 0.52, p less than 0.01). There was no correlation of the FFA levels between S and CSF (n: 26, r: -0.02, p: NS). In CSF, FFA concentrations were correlated with albumin levels (n: 26, r: 0.67, p less than 0.005) and white cell recound (n: 26, r: 0.53, p less than 0.01). Authors discuss results and conclude that: a) bilirubin interferes with FFA metabolism, probably as the result of a toxic effect on extraneuronal tissue; b) an increase of FFA serum concentrations does not cause them to rise in the CSF by transport across blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier; and c) although, the source of the FFA in CSF is varied (from serum or loss of myelin, for instance, as a consequence of an asphyxial insult, or devitalized white cells) their increased concentrations are correlated with enhanced albumin levels and white cell recounts. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Girls were more affected than boys; the sex ratio was 1.5:1. Associated cardiac defects were diagnosed in two patients, one with moderate valvular pulmonic stenosis and the other one with small ventricular septal defect. Typical clinical findings consisted of loud first heart sound, widely fixed split second heart sound and soft ejection systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border were heard in all cases. Mid diastolic murmur due to relative tricuspid stenosis was detected in most cases (75%). Electrocardiographic findings included right axis deviation, prolonged PR-interval and right atrial enlargement were found in 50%, 15% and 60% of cases, respectively. Incomplete right bundle branch block and right ventricular enlargement were found in all cases, as was cardiomegaly with increased vascular markings were found in all cases. Paradoxical ventricular septal motion and visualization of the atrial septal defect were seen in 95% and 75% of cases, respectively. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 19 patients (95%). The pulmonary-systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) ranged from 1.7 to 6.3 (mean 2.9 +/- 0.67), and was correlated to the presence of mid diastolic tricuspid flow murmur and paradoxical ventricular septal motion. Simple closure of the defect was the procedure of choice, but in one patient (5%) pericardial patch was used to close the very large defect. The mortality rate was 10 per cent. Physical retardation was found in all boys and 50% of girls, before surgery. Body weight percentile increased in most cases (61.1%), while body height percentile increased in only 5.6% of cases, postoperatively. Ejection systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border was still detected in one patient (5.6%). Incomplete right bundle branch block persisted in all cases, while cardiomegaly was still found in 5.6% of cases followed-up six months to five years after surgery. There was no residual left ventricular dysfunction in all cases. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The released stock was synthesized by irradiating virgin female progeny derived from the cellar and crossing to a second-chromosome compound laboratory stock. Incorporation of an appropriate genetic background into the compound stock was tested in laboratory studies. Larval development to adult emergence and adult survival studies indicated the compound release stock to be relatively similar to the wild population, while behavioral tests detected no mating isolation between wild or compound genotypes. An unstable equilibrium point of compound frequency 0.7 was observed in population cage experiments with the two genotypes. Adults were released into the cellar at a 50:1 ratio in favor of the compound. Five hundred newly hatched compound-chromosome larvae were also released. Adult, larval and pupal samples were regularly made. The compound stock successfully bred in the cellar maintaining an adult frequency of at least 90% for 108 days after the release. The rapid decline in compound frequency after this period is thought to be due to the migration of inseminated wild-type females from wine storage areas adjacent to the cellar. The results indicate that a compound stock may limit the rate of population expansion in an area and may be a useful mechanism of autocidal control. It cannot be overemphasized that the probability of a successful release will be related to the level of understanding of the adaptive strategy of the population into which the release is made. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Expression of the BCL-2 gene has previously been correlated with cellular proliferation in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells under a variety of experimental conditions. To examine the regulation of p26-BCL-2 protein levels during the cell cycle, we utilized the method of counterflow centrifugal elutriation to enrich for cells in various phases of the cell cycle. Relative levels of p26-BCL-2 protein were measured by immunoblotting, and comparisons were made with a cell cycle-regulated protein, p62-CYCLIN-A, and a protein whose levels are constant throughout the cell cycle, p36-PCNA (DNA polymerase-delta auxiliary factor). Relative levels of p26-BCL-2 and p36-PCNA did not vary among cell fractions enriched for specific phases of the cell cycle, whereas p62-CYCLIN-A was elevated in late S- and G2/M-phase cells. Similar results were obtained with lymphoma and leukemia cell lines that have either normal or translocated BCL-2 genes. These results obtained by elutriation were confirmed by pharmacologically inducing cell cycle arrest in proliferating lymphoid cell lines with hydroxyurea, quercetin, and nocodazole which blocked cells at S, G2, and M phases, respectively. Taken together, the data indicate that p26-BCL-2 is not a true cell cycle-regulated protein, although its levels can fluctuate in connection with changes in rates of cellular proliferation under some circumstances. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The treatment schedule included dose escalation from 15 micrograms/m2 to 150 micrograms/m2 administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for seven to 14 days and was repeated after a two-week treatment-free interval. The blood leukocyte counts increased dose dependently by 130% to 1,800% in ten patients; a rise of monocytes and eosinophils occurred in seven and six patients, respectively. No sustained increase in reticulocytes or platelets was observed. Lymphocyte counts increased in all patients affecting both T-helper and T-suppressor cells; however, the lymphocytes were not activated as analyzed by the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. In four of the patients, all with greater than 14% blast cells in the bone marrow, the percentage of bone marrow blast cells increased during treatment with rhGM-CSF. Cytogenetic data indicated induction of both proliferation and differentiation of the leukemic clones by rhGM-CSF. Toxic side effects were minor with slight fever, phlebitis at the infusion site, and bone pain in the minority of patients. In conclusion, rhGM-CSF effectively stimulates hematopoiesis in vivo in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. However, as the leukemic cell population can be stimulated in patients with a higher initial blast cell count, the combination of rhGM-CSF with other differentiation-inducing or cytotoxic agents has to be considered. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To investigate whether activation of endogenous thrombin contributed to this reduction in relaxant sensitivity, the effects of pretreatment of dogs with the coumarin anticoagulant, brodifacoum, were studied. Experiments were performed in both normal coronary vasculature and coronary vasculature exposed to 90 min of myocardial ischemia, with or without 60 min of subsequent reperfusion. Ischemia was induced in the left anterior descending artery (LAD); nonischemic vessels from the left circumflex (LCX) artery of the same animals were used as control. Thrombin caused dose-dependent relaxation in isolated LCX preconstricted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (Emax of 89.1 +/- 2.33%). Relaxation was reduced by 90 min of ischemia (Emax of 27.5 +/- 8.0%; p less than 0.05), and further reduced after subsequent reperfusion (Emax of 8.7 +/- 8.7%). However, maximum relaxations to acetylcholine, calcimycin, and isoproterenol were unchanged after ischemia (Emax greater than 90% in all groups). Brodifacoum had no effect on thrombin-induced relaxation in control vessels (Emax of 83.0 +/- 3.5%), or on relaxation in response to acetylcholine, calcimycin, or isoproterenol (Emax greater than 90%). In contrast, brodifacoum markedly reduced thrombin-induced relaxation after ischemia (Emax of 3.3 +/- 3.3%; p less than 0.05) yet significantly preserved the relaxant response to thrombin after ischemia and reperfusion (Emax of 36.6 +/- 4.3%). Infusion of the thrombin inhibitor, D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK), during ischemia and reperfusion also preserved in part the relaxant response induced by thrombin (Emax of 30.0 +/- 5.1%; p less than 0.05).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Consquently, in this experimental system the influence of divalent cations on these two processes can be disregarded and their effects on enzymes secretion can be studied directly. Cytochalasin B-treated PMN exposed to C5a in calcium and magnesium-free media consistently secreted significant amounts of the granule-associated enzymes, beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme. The basal secretory response was not diminished if cells were preincubated with 5.0 mM EDTA, nor was it influenced if 1.0 mm or 2.0 mM EDTA were present in the reaction mixtures. The addition of calcium (up to 1.5 to 2.0 mM) produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of beta-glucuronidase release, whereas increasing amounts of calcium (above 2.0 mM) inhibited secretion of this enzyme. Lysozyme release was similarly enhanced by the addition of calcium, but inhibition with high concentrations was not observed. Calcium per se, in the absence of C5a, provoked only the release of lysozyme from these cells. The effects of calcium upon enzyme release were not associated with alterations in the state of assembly of cytoplasmic microtubules. These findings provide another example of the role of calcium in \"stimulus-secretion coupling\" and provide evidence that exocytosis of various granules in human PMN is regulated by independent mechanisms involving calcium. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have cultured chondrocytes from different zones of pig articular cartilage and investigated whether there are intrinsic differences in their behaviour that might account for the variation observed in intact tissue. On isolation, cells from the upper third of the cartilage were smaller than those of the lower third, but this difference was not maintained in culture. Upper zone cells attached and spread more slowly than lower zone cells; morphological differences between the two populations could be seen for several weeks. The growth rates of the two populations were similar, but upper zone cells reached a lower confluent density. Levels of protein synthesis were similar for both populations, but upper zone cells deposited less proteoglycan in the cell layer. On isolation, the percentage of upper zone cells that stained positive with MZ15, a monoclonal antibody to keratan sulphate, was smaller than the percentage of lower zone cells, but this difference was lost after several days in culture. Nevertheless, the keratan sulphate content of proteoglycan synthesised by lower zone chondrocytes at high density was greater than of that synthesised by upper zone cells. The proportion of nonaggregating proteoglycan was greater in upper than lower zone cartilage and this difference was also observed in long-term cultures. proteoglycans were further characterised by composite and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by immunoblotting; differences detected in cartilage extracts were not, however, maintained in culture; instead, the small proteoglycans synthesised by both upper and lower zone cells varied with plating density. Finally, alkaline phosphatase, a marker of hypertrophic, calcifying cartilage, was only expressed in lower zone cultures. We conclude that some of the observed heterogeneity of articular cartilage reflects intrinsic differences between the cells of different zones, whereas some may reflect the response of chondrocytes to different environmental conditions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Lead concentrations in bone greatly exceeded the concentrations in soft tissues and were highest in the dense bones. Bone lead concentrations increased with age in both sexes, more especially in male subjects and in dense bone, varying between mean values of 2-16 ppm in the ribs of children to over 50 ppm in the dense petrous temporal bones of elderly male adults. Male adults contained over 30% more lead in their bones than females. Mean concentrations of lead in the soft tissues varied from less than 0-1 ppm in organs such as muscle and heart to over 2 ppm in the aorta. In most tissues with lead values in excess of 0-2 ppm the male concentrations exceeded female values by about 30%. With the exception of the aorta, spleen, lung, and prostate, lead concentrations did not increase with age in the soft tissues of either sex after about the second decade of life. Children showed concentrations of lead in their soft tissues comparable to female adults, but the concentrations in bone were much lower. It is suggested that children do not possess the same capacity as adults to retain lead in bone. In male adults occupationally exposed to lead the concentrations of lead in bone exceeded the concentrations in unexposed male adults within the same age group by two-to three-fold. Soft tissue lead concentrations between the two groups were less divergent. An assessment of the total body burden of lead revealed higher levels in adult male subjects than in females at mean values of 164-8 mg compared to 103-6 mg, respectively. Over 90% of the total body burden of lead in adults was in bone, of which over 70% was in dense bone. Male adults occupationally exposed to lead had mean total body burdens of 566-4 mg Pb, of which 97% was in bone. The release of lead from bone in conjunction with calcium was not considered to be of physiological significance. Lead concentrations of hair and nails were higher than soft tissue lead concentrations and varied widely. Hair lead measurements were not considered to provide a reliable assessment of lead absorption. The concentrations of lead in tissues of a mixed group of subjects with no known occupational exposure to lead have been shown to be comparable to the findings in earlier studies. Present levels of lead in the environment are not considered to be a hazard to the health of the population in general. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Degeneration of the epithelial cells and the start of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of the cornea occurred initially. These changes were followed by loss of the epithelium, degeneration and loss of the keratocytes and endothelium, loss of the characteristic weblike pattern of the proteoglycan ground substance, dispersal of ultrastructurally normal collagen fibrils, extensive accumulation followed by degeneration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and accumulation of plasma proteins and fibrin in the necrotic cornea. Histochemical examination of the cornea suggested a loss of the proteoglycan ground substance but not of collagen. Rabbit corneas injected with Clostridium histolyticum collagenase showed gross and cellular changes similar to those observed during the pseudomonal infections; however, histochemical examination suggested a loss of collagen, and electron microscopy revealed ultrastructurally abnormal collagen fibrils. The results support the idea (i) that a bacterial or host-derived collagenase is not required for extensive corneal damage during a P. aeruginosa corneal infection, and (ii) that a P. aeruginosa corneal infection may severly damage the cornea by producing extensive corneal edema and by causing the loss of the corneal proteoglycan ground substance, thus resulting in dispersal of undamaged collagen fibrils, weakening of the cornea, and subsequent descemetocele formation and corneal perforation by the anterior chamber pressure. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Leading symptoms were chronic asymmetrical weakness in all three cases, which started in a distal portion of the upper extremities. Muscle atrophy was often less prominent than would be expected from the power of the muscle. Fasciculations were observed in two patients and the initial symptom of patient 2 was painful cramp of the right thumb. Patient 1 initially had mild transient dysesthesia of the right fingers. The other two patients had no sensory symptoms or signs. General laboratory tests revealed no particular abnormalities except that patient 3 had mild diabetes mellitus, although the type of neuropathy in patient 3 was quite different from diabetic neuropathy. Total protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were 34, 32 and 43 mg/dl in three patients, respectively (normally, less than 40 mg/dl). Motor nerve conduction studies revealed conduction block in more than one nerve in every case. Conduction velocities were generally normal in those segments of nerve where conduction block was not detected. Serum anti-ganglioside antibodies were investigated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Glycolipids used as the antigen include GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1b, GD3, GT1b, GQ1b, GA1 and galactocerebroside. Strong IgM antibody activity against GM1, GD1b and GA1 was noted in patient 1. Weaker but significant IgM antibody activities against GM1 and GA1 were detected in patient 2 and 3. Thin-layer chromatography immunostaining also confirmed these results.

We compared the kinetically measured Kt/V (A) to estimated Kt/V derived from approximate total body water (0.6 body weight) and uniform dialyzer clearance (B), Kt/V = 0.04 PRU-1.2 where PRU is % reduction in BUN (C) and Kt/V = In(R-0.03-UF/W) where R is post/pre BUN, UF is ultrafiltration L/HD and W is postdialysis weight (D) in 26 patients. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.14 (p less than 0.05) for A vs. B; 0.75 (p less than 0.01) A vs. C; 0.77 (p less than 0.01) A vs. D; and 0.97 for C vs. D. In an additional 51 patients, Kt/V was calculated using formulas B, C, and D. The r was 0.91 C vs. D, 0.70 B vs. D, and 0.68 B vs. C. With B, greater than 30% of the patients could have been misclassified using NCDS criteria for adequacy of dialysis. The study suggests that use of formulas C and D, but not B, is appropriate and accurate for Kt/V calculation. Formula C may be simpler and easier than D, as UF and W are not required.

There is a significant (P less than 0.01) 62% increase in beta-receptor density, a significant (P less than 0.05) 115% decrease in ligand affinity, a significant (P less than 0.05) 33% decrease of high-affinity binding sites for (-)-isoproterenol and a significant (P less than 0.01) 151% decrease of the affinity of the high-affinity agonist binding site. Basal adenylate cyclase activity and the activity after stimulation with guanine nucleotides and forskolin were significantly higher in old animals as compared to young (P less than 0.01). Stimulation of the system with isoproterenol in the presence of GTP was more effective in old animals, although the P less than 0.05 level of significance was barely reached. It is suggested that age-dependent changes of the beta-adrenoceptors in rat kidney are similar to those described for lungs: changes at the different levels of the beta-adrenergic transduction chain associated with age are compensatory so as to ensure equal cAMP synthesis for a given agonist stimulation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fibers were superfused with a control Tyrode\\'s solution, followed by an ischemic superfusate that included 10 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, Po2 of 10-25 mm Hg, and pH 6.7. To exclude beta-adrenergic actions, propranolol was added to all solutions. In the presence of phenylephrine, normal automaticity at high membrane potentials usually decreased, whereas the incidence of abnormal automaticity during ischemia was increased from a control value of 10% to 30%. Block of an alpha 1-receptor subtype with chloroethylclonidine in the presence of phenylephrine caused normal automaticity to increase in all fibers studied and significantly increased abnormal automaticity to 70%. The alpha-adrenergic-induced increase in automaticity did not occur in ischemic fibers from animals pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX), which ADP-ribosylated and functionally inactivated the 41-kd family of GTP regulatory proteins. In contrast, the use of PTX enhanced the increase in automaticity induced by phenylephrine in normally polarized Purkinje fibers. Ryanodine, which blocks sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, attenuated the increase in normal automaticity in nonischemic fibers but had no effect on abnormal automaticity in ischemic fibers. The increase in abnormal automaticity was, however, blocked by the alpha 1 subtype blocker WB 4101, which also blocks the increase in automaticity in normal fibers. In conclusion, the increase in abnormal automaticity in ischemic Purkinje fibers depends on a WB 4101-sensitive alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype whose actions are transduced by a PTX-sensitive 41-kd G protein and are not blocked by ryanodine.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC), these enzymes were purified and exhibited a pI of 4.5 and Mr of 37,000 using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. An immunochemical enzyme assay using anti-spectrin antibodies was developed. The optimal activity using spectrin as substrate was at pH 5.0, and the enzymes were strongly inhibited by HgCl2, ZnCl2, chymostatin, leupeptin and aprotinin, and moderately by pepstatin. These properties of the Pf37 and Pb37 proteases differ from the Plasmodium lophurae and P. falciparum 'cathepsin D-like' enzymes and from the serine or cysteine neutral proteases previously described in P. falciparum and P. berghei infected red blood cells. While the Pf37 and Pb37 enzymes cleaved spectrin preferentially, degradation of band 4.1 was also observed with high concentration of enzyme. The parasite origin of the Pf37 protease was clearly demonstrated, since purified radiolabeled enzyme was active on spectrin. A high-molecular-weight polymer (greater than 240 kDa) was often observed on incubating purified spectrin and Pf37 protease.

The purified enzyme was composed of 2 identical sub-units with a molecular weight of 45.000 and had a pI of 4.7. Its Vmax value and Km value for L-arginine were estimated to be 50 units/mg protein and 0.2 mM, respectively. It exerted maximal enzyme activity at pH 6.0-7.5 and at 50 degrees C. The arginine deiminase was stable at neutral pH. When injected i.v. into mice, the half-life of the arginine deiminase in blood was about 4 hr. In culture, the enzyme strongly inhibited the growth of 6 kinds of mouse tumor cell lines by depleting L-arginine in the culture media. When the in vivo growth-inhibitory activity of arginine deiminase was tested for the 6 tumor cell lines, i.p. administration of the purified enzyme effectively prolonged the survival time of the mice injected with all kinds of the tumor cell lines. Especially, the in vivo growth of a hepatoma cell line, MH134, was completely prevented by the daily administration at a dose of 0.2 mg/mouse for 14 days.

A randomized controlled trial. Academic group practices of a major urban teaching hospital. Study physicians were three equivalent groups of PG-2 and PG-3 residents (N = 33) seeing patients in equivalent outpatient clinics. Continuity patients of these residents were included (N = 240) if they were younger than 66 years, saw their primary physician during the intervention period, were not pregnant, and had no serious life-shortening noncardiac illnesses. Three interventions were implemented over a 5-week period. Control group physicians (group 1) were offered only a standard lecture provided through the Physician Cholesterol Education Program (PCEP). Group 2 physicians were offered the PCEP lecture and also received generic chart reminders of the NCEP guidelines on each eligible patient's chart. Group 3 physicians were offered the PCEP lecture and also received timely patient-specific feedback, including acknowledgement of recent lipid values and management, and explicit recommendations for further action. Knowledge of lipid disorders was tested before and after the PCEP lecture, and physicians' attitudes were surveyed following the intervention period. The three groups were similar in baseline (preintervention) compliance with NCEP recommendations (average, 39%) and physicians' knowledge. Patients were similar across groups in number of coronary artery disease risk factors and cholesterol values. Significant within-group improvements in compliance were noted for groups 2 and 3 (7.6% and 10.6%, respectively), but not for group 1 (4.5%). Importantly, there were no differences observed in improvements across groups. In exploratory analyses, however, there was a significant correlation between improved compliance and the number of patients seen by each provider in group 3 that was not observed in groups 1 or 2. Notably, changes in compliance were unrelated to PCEP lecture attendance (8.6% vs 8.1% for attenders vs nonattenders, respectively), level of postgraduate training, baseline or later tests of knowledge, or patient factors. The postintervention survey revealed marked overestimation by physicians of their personal compliance with NCEP guidelines, although there was strong support for clinic efforts that would screen patients for lipid disorders independent of physician initiative. This study raises questions about the effectiveness of education alone for improving compliance with NCEP guidelines. The effectiveness and efficiency of timely, individualized feedback should be explored in studies over a longer period. Innovative alternative approaches are suggested by the responses to our survey and other research in preventive practices. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The second increase was much higher in magnitude than the first peak and reached its maximum after 1 h of stimulation. Such kinetics of DAG formation resemble those with which AII stimulates the formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which prevents hormone-induced de novo phospholipid synthesis in adrenal fasciculata cells, had no effect on the DAG response to Aii. The first phase of signal generation of both inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG was not affected by incubation in calcium-deficient extracellular medium. However, the second phase of the inositol phosphate response was almost completely inhibited in low calcium medium, while the DAG response was reduced by only one third. Pertussis toxin (150 ng/ml) and the voltage-sensitive calcium channel inhibitors, nifedipine (1 microM) and Ni2+ (100 microM), had no effect on the DAG response to AII. The retention of a substantial DAG response to AII in low calcium medium, with concomitant diminution of the inositol phosphate response, indicates that a major part of the DAG formed during the sustained phase of hormonal stimulation is derived from sources other than phosphoinositides. The DAGs produced from different phospholipids could have distinctive fatty acid compositions and membrane localizations, which, in turn, could result in the differential activation of protein kinase-C. In this way, the increased complexity of the hormonally induced signalling pathway could allow for a greater diversity of responses in hormone-stimulated target cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two fractions, one enriched in polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNA fraction), and a second fraction enriched in aromatic and heterocyclic amines (basic fraction), were selected for most of this work because of their comparatively high mutagenicity (i.e., compared with raw shale oil). The crude shale oil, as well as the basic, PNA, and tar fractions were mutagenic against the Salmonella typhimurium test strains, TA98 and TA100. Mutation was dependent on metabolic activation by microsomal (S9) enzymes. Both test strains responded equally well to the crude product and to the basic fraction; however, strain TA100 was more effective than TA198 in demonstrating the mutagenicity of the PNA fraction. The mutagenicity of the tar fraction could be most easily detected after metabolic activation in a liquid medium, as opposed to S9 activation in the top agar of the standard Ames assay. The mutagenicity of the basic fraction or 2-aminoanthracene was also demonstrated by metabolic activation in a liquid medium. In other set of experiments, the effect of chemical composition on the expression of mutagenicity in the standard Ames assay was estimated. Premutagens requiring metabolic activation were added to the basic and PNA fractions, and the numbers of revertants obtained in the presence of the fractions were compared with mutation induced by the compounds alone. The basic fraction did not interfere with the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene and 7,9 dimethylbenz[c]acridine. Moreover, in certain experiments, the mutagenicity of the complex fraction plus the added compound was higher than expected on the basis of assays performed on these materials separately. Conversely, the PNA fraction prevented or strongly inhibited mutation by several polynuclear aroumatic compounds, and an acridine. However, the PNA fraction did not inhibit mutation induced by 2-aminoanthracene. The effect of the basic fraction on stability of the S9 enzymes in the standard Ames test was also determined. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fever (100.4 to 102.2 Fahrenheit) was observed in every patient during the early phase of treatment. Other side-effects included rigors, myalgia, headache and laboratory changes such as leucopenia, neutropenia and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia. However, the tolerance was considered acceptable and treatment had to be interrupted in only one patient presenting generalized mucosal lesions attributed to a hypersensitivity reaction. The response to IFN-R in NANB-CH was considered positive when serum aminotransferase levels became normal or below two times the upper normal limit. Out of eight patients who completed the treatment, four were considered as responders but one of them, treated during five months, showed a relapse after three months. On the other hand, in one patient treated for twelve months, a persistent normalization of serum amino-transferases was observed: a liver biopsy showed a striking decrease of the inflammatory changes. As to the B-CH. 3 out of 8 patients who completed the treatment showed a disappearance of HBeAg and DNA-polymerase and were considered as responders.

Of 64 patients with pathologic Q waves, 95 percent demonstrated asynergy. Q waves in the anterior leads denoted asynergy in 30 of 30 patients, anterior asynergy in 29 of 30 and an anterior aneurysm in 25. Q waves in the inferior leads indicated asynergy in 30 of 33 patients, inferior asynergy in 25 of 30 and an associated aneurysm in 19. Conversely, of 52 patients with an aneurysm, 44 also had pathologic Q waves. If Q waves were present, 72 percent of asynergic zones exhibited akinesis or dyskinesis; however, in the absence of Q waves an aneurysm was present in only 22 percent (P less than 0.0001). Hemodynamically, anterior asynergy, whether defined by Q waves or by ventriculography, was associated with more left ventricular dysfunction than was inferior asynergy (P less than 0.01). Of 21 patients with a cardiomyopathy, none had pathologic Q waves. The data indicate that pathologic Q waves can aid significantly in predicting the presence and location of a severely asynergic zone. Although their absence does not exclude the possibility of asynergy, the latter is much less likely and, if present, amy be of milder form. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Larvae were harvested from mosquito tissues at 5 (early L2), 8 (late L2) and 11 (L3) days post-infection and labeled with 125I-Iodo-Gen. The results of one-dimensional analysis showed that there is a progressive increase in the complexity of peptides associated with the surface of developing larvae, culminating in the expression of 7 major labeled components on L3s. Both L2 and L3 parasites have surface-associated components of 42, 35, 33, 19 and 17 kDa. Between days 8 and 11 of development in the insect vector, Brugia malayi undergoes the L2 to L3 molt and acquires additional major immunogenic peptides of 40 and 22 kDa. Two-dimensional analyses of extracts from 125I-labeled L2s and L3s revealed that the major 35-, 33-, 19- and 17-kDa molecules are part of a peptide complex that forms a 'ladder' between 17 and 150 kDa. To gain information on the times during which the major surface-associated molecules are produced by the parasite, larvae were labeled with [35S]methionine either in situ as they developed within the mosquito or during culture after exiting the vector. For in situ labeling, [35S]methionine was introduced into the hemolymph of infected mosquitoes by micro-injection at days 2, 5 and 8 post-infection and the larvae were allowed to develop for an additional 3 days. The results of 1- and 2-dimensional analyses of [35S]methionine-labeled extracts from vector-stage or post-vector-stage larvae indicate that the molecules associated with the surface of B. malayi L3s are synthesized between day 5 and day 11 of development in the insect host. Immediately after the larvae exit the vector, the synthesis of the 40 and 22-kDa peptides is drastically reduced or terminated. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The dendrites and cell body contained extensive networks of tubular early endosomes which received endocytosed markers from the somatodendritic domain. In axons early endosomes were confined to presynaptic terminals and to varicosities. The somatodendritic but not the presynaptic early endosomes were labeled by internalized transferrin. In contrast to early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes were shown to be predominantly located in the cell body. Video microscopy was used to follow the transport of internalized markers from the periphery of axons and dendrites back to the cell body. Labeled structures in both domains moved unidirectionally by retrograde fast transport. Axonally transported organelles were sectioned for EM after video microscopic observation and shown to be large multivesicular body-like structures. Similar structures accumulated at the distal side of an axonal lesion. Multivesicular bodies therefore appear to be the major structures mediating transport of endocytosed markers between the nerve terminals and the cell body. Late endocytic structures were also shown to be highly mobile and were observed moving within the cell body and proximal dendritic segments. The results show that the organization of the endosomes differs in the axons and dendrites of cultured rat hippocampal neurons and that the different compartments or stages of the endocytic pathways can be resolved spatially. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

During this period, out of 1,806 certico-prostatic obstacles, 1,180 were treated by resection of a prostatic adenoma with a mean age of 68,3 years and a range of 37 to 94 years. The surgical indications fell into four groups: dominant dysuria, dominant pollakiuria, complicated adenomas and patients with a single past episode of acute urinary retention. Resection was performed with a direct current (IglÃ©sias) essentially with sterile demineralized water. General anesthesia was used in 2/3 of the cases and loco-regional anesthesia in 1/3 of the cases. A traditional resection technique was used, and postoperative bladder drainage used a Mercier 24 catheter. Continuous lavage was not performed. Duration of resection was 10 to 120 minutes with a mean of 39 minutes. The resected weight ranged between 8 and 130 grams with a mean of 24.2 grams. Duration of the indwelling catheter decreased from 5 days in 1976 to 24 or 48 hours in 1982. Duration of hospitalization decreased from 12 to 7 days, and down to 5 days today. Complications were uncommon: 2 deaths (0.17%) due to acute pancreatitis and mesenteric infarction; 1 perforated bladder; 4 septicemia with shock; 2 acute renal failures requiring dialysis; 5 pulmonary emboli; 3 hemiplegia; 1 acute nonfatal pancreatitis. Only 50 patients (4.2%) required transfusions. There was no permanent urinary incontinence but there were 12 (0.1%) cervical stenoses, and 37 (3.13%) urethral stenoses. Five-hundred-and-fifty-two patients were followed for one year and more: the results were overall very good.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Furosemide-treated animals were offered saline as drinking fluid to replace urinary losses. Effects of naCl intake were evaluated using free-flow micropuncture, in vivo microperfusion, and morphometric techniques. Dietary NaCl restriction did not affect NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule but markedly increased the capacity of the distal convoluted tubule to transport Na and Cl. Chronic furosemide infusion increased NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule and also increased the rates of Na and Cl transport above the rates observed in low NaCl diet rats. When compared with high NaCl intake alone, chronic furosemide infusion with saline ingestion increased the fractional volume of distal convoluted tubule cells by nearly 100%, whereas dietary NaCl restriction had no effect. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that (a) chronic NaCl restriction increases the transport ability of the distal convoluted tubule independent of changes in tubule structure, (b) high rates of ion delivery to the distal nephron cause tubule hypertrophy, and (c) tubule hypertrophy is associated with increases in ion transport capacity. They indicate that the distal tubule adapts functionally and structurally to perturbations in dietary Na and Cl intake. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ppw, reflecting the pressure in a large pulmonary vein, approximates the left atrial pressure, whereas Pdw reflects the pressure in a smaller pulmonary vein. Pdw was greater than Ppw in all 64 patients. The Pdw-Ppw gradient was 1.1 +/- 0.5 mmHg in nine patients with normal lungs and was significantly higher in 13 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (3.8 +/- 0.8 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and in 22 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (3.8 +/- 0.8 mmHg; P less than 0.01), but not in 20 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg). The distribution of the pulmonary vascular resistance was clearly different among the four groups. The fraction of the total pulmonary vascular resistance attributable to large and medium pulmonary veins was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in adult respiratory distress syndrome (27.5 +/- 12%) and cardiac patients (27.5 +/- 9%) compared with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13 +/- 5%) and normal lungs (13.5 +/- 6%).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These clotting tendencies can be acquired or congenital. The common causes of acquired clotting tendencies include conditions which result in tissue and cellular damage, shock, transfusion reactions, and tissue necrosis. Certain drugs and drug reactions, and certain disease states which include blood dyscrasias and cancer are also associated with clotting problems. In certain diseases such as homocystinuria, hyperlipidemia, and lupus erythematosus, abnormal clotting tendencies may also develop. Important advances in the recognition of hypercoagulability have come with the documentation that congenital clotting abnormalities exist. Moreover, these abnormalities are proving to be more common than are congenital bleeding syndromes. Patients who appear to have spontaneous clotting manifestations and are under 40 years of age should be screened for one of these abnormalities. These congenital clotting tendencies can be classified as defects in thrombosis inhibitors, dysfibrinogenemias, or defects in fibrinolysis. The first thrombotic inhibitor defect recognized was antithrombin III deficiency which was reported in 1965. Subsequently, Protein C, Protein S, and Heparin cofactor II deficiencies have been recognized as contributing to thrombotic tendencies. Dysfibrinogenemias are relatively rare and most are associated with bleeding problems; however, 11% of the abnormal fibrinogens are associated with a clotting tendency. The reason appears to be that these fibrins are resistant to fibrinolysis. The most common defects which are associated with thrombotic tendencies appear, at the present time, to be due to defects in fibrinolysis. These include hypoplasminogenemia, decreases in plasminogen activator, increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor, and Factor XII deficiency. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic recordings were used to determine the kinetic parameters of the quantal responses under normal conditions and in the presence of strychnine, a competitive antagonist of glycine, which is the putative transmitter at these synapses. Calculations indicate that if the postsynaptic density, which has a radius of 0.1 micron, were to accommodate the population of channels estimated to be opened during a quantal response, the glycine binding site density in that region would be unrealistically high. Computer simulation of the quantal responses included transmitter diffusion, transmitter-receptor interactions, and channel activation under conditions including both normal and lowered binding site densities, the latter corresponding to the experimental data obtained with strychnine. The data indicate that the synaptic receptors involved in generating unitary responses are widely distributed to include regions located outside the junctional area, which directly faces the presynaptic release sites. We further suggest that the receptor matrix is surrounded by a restricted diffusional space; this geometrical organization may underlie the finding that response rise times are relatively independent of receptor binding site densities. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in the rat by permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with halothane inhalation and left MCA was occluded via trans-retro-orbital approach. Normal and sham-operated rats were used as control animals. The animals were decapitated 2 (MCA = 5, Sham = 5), 4 (MCA = 7, Sham = 6), 8 (MCA = 5, Sham = 5), and 16 (MCA = 6, Sham = 6) hours or 1 (MCA = 5, Sham = 5), 2 (MCA = 6, Sham = 6), 7 (MCA = 7, Sham = 6), 14 (MCA = 6, Sham = 5), and 28 (MCA = 7, Sham = 5) days after the operation. The brains were removed and divided into right and left hemisphere. Each hemisphere was homogenized and centrifuged. The supernates were filtered with membrane filter. An aliquot of the filtrate was used for measurement of xanthine and uric acid in both of the ischemic and contralateral hemisphere by a HPLC system.

They provide education and set Institutional policy. They are an exciting and sometimes frightening reflection of changing health care, as issues involving allocation of scarce resources, withholding or withdrawing treatment, autonomy and the patient's right to refuse treatment, and access to care arise in clinical care. This article has described how to initiate and maintain an ethics committee, as well as the nurse's pivotal role in identifying conflict and assisting in conflict resolution. Cranford and Roberts offer a few timeless tips for the beginning committee. They advise forming the committee with three or four people who have expressed interest, rather than recruiting those who may lose interest. More than three or four people may be needed to conduct committee business, so if recruiting is necessary, select compassionate people who are not likely to monopolize the meetings. Likewise, the chair should be affable yet assertive. Recognize that ethics committees will function differently from institution to institution, so comparisons may not be helpful. Proceed toward goals, but pay attention to the process of committee function and modify the process as needed. Finally, proceed at a pace most comfortable to members of the committee and to the institution. The pace may seem slow, but attitudes toward the committee, which may be negative at first, are slow to change. The end result is a viable body of caring people to address the needs of its institution, its staff, and most importantly, its patients and families.

A control group of sedentary men (n = 7) and an experimental group of weight lifters (n = 12) volunteered for a standard M-mode echocardiographic assessment. Indices of cardiac function as well as absolute left ventricular dimensions and left ventricular mass were similar between the groups. Standardizing for body surface area and body weight separated the groups. The weight lifters were shown to have a more muscular left ventricular posterior wall. The weight lifters also demonstrated a dilated left ventricle when indexing for body surface area. All other dimensional and volumetric indices were non-significant. The present investigation underlines the need for matching control and experimental groups to biometric variables in order to avoid misinterpreting cardiac enlargement. There is evidence for a true relative hypertrophy in weight lifters as indicated by similar absolute cardiac dimensions and similar biometric variables. Therefore, when evaluating athletes engaged in a chronic pressure overload, cardiac hypertrophy indices should consider body surface area (BSA), body weight and lean body weight (LBW). Future work in this field should incorporate rigorous controls on all biometric variables for better interpretation of hypertrophy in relative or absolute terms. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The correlation coefficients generated by plotting the IC50 values (the concentrations of compounds that inhibit the growth of tumors by 50%) of some hydrazones against certain electronic, hydrophobic, and steric constants of the aryl substituents indicated only weak correlations.

We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that annexin I concentration in human amnion is reduced with labor and that this reduction is mediated by a decrease in annexin I messenger ribonucleic acid expression. Amnion and choriodecidua were collected from term singleton pregnancies, eight after spontaneous vaginal delivery and eight from elective cesarean section without labor. Annexin I protein was quantitated by Western blotting. Ribonucleic acid was isolated from amnion, and then annexin I messenger ribonucleic acid was identified by Northern hybridization and quantitated by slot blotting. Annexin I (35 kd) was identified in amnion tissue. The concentration in the group undergoing labor (320 +/- 45 integrated optical density units, mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with that in the group not undergoing labor (635 +/- 65 units). The size of the annexin I messenger ribonucleic acid was approximately 1.8 kb. The mean integrated optical density for the labor group (840 +/- 139 units, mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with that of the nonlabor group (1912 +/- 464 units). There is a significant decrease in annexin I messenger ribonucleic acid expression in human amnion with labor, corresponding to a significant decrease in annexin I protein concentration. This may contribute to the increased phospholipase A2 activity, arachidonic acid mobilization, and prostaglandin production at labor in humans. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A sustained and marked inhibition of acid secretion in the rat results in hypergastrinemia, with gastrin cell hyperplasia, and a consequent hyperplasia of the ECL cells. This response of the ECL cells was predictable in view of previous observations that sustained hypergastrinemia causes ECL cell hyperplasia. While the gastrin cell hyperplasia levels off at about twice the normal cell density a few weeks after start of treatment, the ECL cells continue to proliferate for months to reach a five-fold higher density than normally. Evidence is accumulating that ECL cells proliferate through self replication. After life-long inhibition of acid production (high doses of ranitidine or omeprazole) or after extirpation of 75% of the acid-producing part of the stomach, ECL cell carcinoids develop. Endocrine cells in the gut often contain more than one putative messenger. Thus, gastrin cells in many species store GABA and peptide YY; in e.g. cat and man they store in addition a xenopsin-like peptide. Neuromedin U and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) have recently been demonstrated in gut nerves. Their role in gut physiology remains to be identified. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The distribution patterns of the myelinated fibers of the intact internal (SLNI) and external (SLNE) branches in the rat were unimodal with a fiber diameter range of 0.5-12 microns and with peaks at 2-4 microns. Numerous unmyelinated fibers, ranging in diameter from 0.1-2.3 microns, were evenly distributed all over the nerve. The SLNI contained no degenerated myelinated fibers after intracranial vagotomy, but about 25% of the unmyelinated fibers showed degenerative features. In the SLNE 2-10% of the myelinated fibers and about 25% of the unmyelinated fibers were degenerated after the same procedure. Extracranial vagotomy caused degeneration of nearly all fibers in the SLNI and SLNE. Single unmyelinated fibers appeared normal after this procedure. Occasional myelinated and a few unmyelinated fibers were degenerated after excision of the superior cervical ganglion. It is inferred from the results that a majority of the myelinated fibers in the SLN (96-99%) are sensory, with the cell bodies in the extracranial vagal ganglia. The SLNE was also found to be predominantly sensory, as only 2-10% of the myelinated fibers and about 25% of the unmyelinated fibers had their cell bodies in the brainstem. Single myelinated and a few unmyelinated fibers in both the SLNI and SLNE had their origin in the superior cervical ganglion. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty (2.8%) subsequently died and 654 (90.3%) were followed up at a median age of 3 years 3 months. Fifty five (7.6%) survivors had major neurodevelopmental handicaps not attributable to congenital anomalies. Increasing prevalence of major handicap was found with decreasing birth weight and gestation. Children with birth weights of less than 1251 g had a higher incidence of all major disabilities. Handicapped children with a birth weight less than 1251 g were more likely to have blindness, deafness, multiple disabilities, and more severe cerebral palsy. There were 146 (20.2%) children with minor disabilities: neurological impairments (n = 11), borderline results on psychometric testing (n = 18), visual impairments (n = 52), hearing impairments (n = 40), and speech impairments (n = 71). Children weighing less than 1251 g at birth had a higher incidence of minor visual and hearing impairments. In 389 children the mean Griffiths quotient was 101.6 (SD 17.2) (range 50-147), and 158 children had a mean Wechsler preschool and primary intelligence quotient of 101.8 (13.2) (range 56-127): these quotients did not vary with birth weight or gestation but did vary with socioeconomic group, schooling, and family structure. During the study period an improving prognosis in terms of both survival and handicap was observed in children weighing less than 1251 g at birth. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this study, we investigated v-Ha-ras-induced papillomas for aberrant expression of type I keratin K13, previously described in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (DMBA/TPA)-induced mouse epidermal tumors. Papillomas produced from three independent infection series were removed 3 wk after grafting concomitant with control grafts originating from mock-, neo-, and v-fos-infected primary keratinocytes. Combined analysis of the grafts by western blotting of extracted keratins and immunofluorescence studies of frozen sections with a K13-monospecific antibody revealed K13 expression in all v-Ha-ras-induced papillomas and absence of this keratin in all control grafts. K13-positive cells in papillomas were restricted to the suprabasal cell layers of the lesions and, at this stage of papilloma development, occurred as foci of varying extensions. Analysis of genomic DNA from v-Ha-ras-induced papillomas for the methylation state of a CpG dinucleotide in the distant promoter region of the K13 gene revealed the occurrence of unmethylated DNA copies that were generated at the expense of methylated DNA copies ubiquitously present in normal epidermis. The ratio of unmethylated to methylated DNA copies correlated with the extent of suprabasal K13 protein expression. Thus, all features of aberrant K13 expression previously described in DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas were shared by v-Ha-ras-induced papillomas. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In one system the cells were plated next to each other only sharing the culture medium (separated cocultures) and in the other system the granule cells were plated on top of a preformed layer of astrocytes (sandwich cocultures). Using astrocytes from cerebellum, granule cells developed morphologically and functionally showing a characteristic high activity of the glutamate synthesizing enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) as well as a high stimulus-coupled transmitter release regardless of the culture system, i.e., granule cells could grow on top of cerebellar astrocytes as well as next to these cells. In the case of cerebral cortex astrocytes it was found that cerebellar granule cells did not develop (11% survival) when seeded on top of these astrocytes. This was indicated by the morphological appearance of the cultures as well as by a negligible difference between the AAT activity in sandwich cocultures and astrocytes cultured alone. On the other hand, granule cells in separated cocultures with cerebral cortex astrocytes exhibited a normal morphology and a high activity of AAT as well as a large stimulus-coupled transmitter release. Cerebellar and cortical astrocytes expressed the astrocyte specific enzyme glutamine synthetase in a glucocorticoid-inducible form regardless of the culture system. The results show that under conditions of direct contact between granule cells and astrocytes, regional specificity exists with regard to neuron-glia contacts. This specificity does not seem to involve soluble factors present in the culture medium because in separated cocultures the cerebellar granule cells developed normally regardless of the regional origin of the astrocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ninety-six around-the-clock saliva theophylline profiles were performed in 59 children (median age, 8.3 years) under routine life conditions. Five to seven stimulated saliva samples were collected by parents at home during a 24-hour period. Highest (Cmax) and lowest (Cmin) saliva theophylline concentrations (Sal-TC) were not consistently found after or before medication, respectively. Cmax occurred during morning hours (before or after medication) in 82% of patients. Cmax was found immediately before morning or evening dose in as many as 25% of patients. Cmin occurred in 70% of children during evening hours. Cmin was found 4 hours after morning or evening dose in 19% of patients. Excessive fluctuation in Sal-TC between pre- and post-SRT doses during both day and night hours occurred in six patients (286% +/- 87% (mean +/- SD)). Marked circadian variation in Sal-TC was disclosed in 23% of children. The first profile performed was therapeutically satisfactory in only 39% of patients; satisfactory profiles were achieved in other children after changing daily SRT dose or dosing interval. Determination of theophylline concentration in stimulated saliva specimens obtained frequently during a 24-hour period and under routine life conditions is practical and extremely valuable for close monitoring and individualization of theophylline therapy in ambulatory children with asthma. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Structural changes in the tRNA were monitored via the 5-fluorouracil residues located at positions 33 and 34 in the anticodon loop, as well as in all other loops and stems of the molecule. Binding of GpUpApA, which is complementary to the anticodon and the 5'-adjacent FUra 33, shifts two resonances in the 19F spectrum. One, peak H (3.90 p.p.m.), is also shifted by GpUpA and was previously assigned to FUra 34 at the wobble position of the anticodon. The effects of GpUpApA differ from those of GpUpA in that the tetranucleotide induces the downfield shift of a second resonance, peak F (4.5 p.p.m.), in the 19F spectrum of 19F-labeled tRNA(Val)1. Evidence that the codon-containing oligonucleotides bind to the anticodon was obtained from shifts in the methyl proton spectrum of the 6-methyladenosine residue adjacent to the anticodon and from cleavage of the tRNA at the anticodon by RNase H after binding dGpTpApA, a deoxy analog of the ribonucleotide codon. The association constant for the binding of GpUpApA to fluorinated tRNA(Val)1, obtained by Scatchard analysis of the n.m.r. results, is in good agreement with values obtained by other methods. On the basis of these results, we assign peak F in the 19F n.m.r. spectrum of 19F-labeled tRNA(Val)1 to FUra 33. This assignment and the previous assignment of peak H to FUra 34 are supported by the observation that the intensities of peaks F and H in the 19F spectrum of fluorinated tRNA(Val)1 are specifically decreased after partial hydrolysis with nucleass S1 under conditions leading to cleavage in the anticodon loop. The downfield shift of peak F occurs only with adenosine in the 3'-position of the tetranucleotide; binding of GpUpApG, GpUpApC, or GpUpApU results only in the upfield shift of peak H. The possibility is discussed that this base-specific interaction between the 3'-terminal adenosine and the 5-fluorouracil residue at position 33 involves a 5'-stacked conformation of the anticodon loop. Evidence also is presented for a temperature-dependent conformational change in the anticodon loop below the melting temperature of the tRNA. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

An analysis of tritium in wet and dry tissues of rats at the end of 22 days' chronic exposure showed that the chemical form of the ingested tritium was more important for tritium uptake in dry tissues than in wet tissues. The concentrations of tritium in dry tissues (organically bound tritium: OBT) after the exposure to tritiated organic compounds were consistently higher than after the exposure to 3HHO. The highest concentrations of OBT were found in rats exposed to tritiated amino acids [( 3H]lysine and [3H]leucine), which were 4-9 times higher than those in rats exposed to 3HHO. The next higher concentrations of OBT were found in rats exposed to [3H]uridine. The result of radiation dose estimations at the end of chronic exposure showed that the contribution of OBT to the total dose rate was higher in the tissues of rats exposed to tritiated organic compounds than that after the exposure to 3HHO. However, the differences between the total dose rates from 3HHO and those from tritiated organic compounds were within a factor of 2. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Before vaccination, 49% and 28% had naturally acquired antibodies against PSA and PSC, respectively, whereas 18 days after vaccine administration 84% and 91%, respectively, showed a detectable spectrotypic pattern. Oligoclonality appeared to be the main feature of naturally acquired and vaccine-induced antibodies for both polysaccharides. In all subjects the anti-PSA response, showing dominant bands at the same pH position, was more homogeneous than anti-PSC one. Most subjects with naturally acquired antibodies (25 out of 38 for PSA and 20 out of 22 for PSC) showed a spectrotypic pattern after vaccination, similar to that observed before vaccination (any differences were just related to band intensity), suggesting that PSA and PSC are able to recruit the same B cell clones previously primed with a T-dependent form of the antigen, i.e. the whole bacterium. However, in one-third of subjects with naturally acquired anti-PSA antibodies, the appearance of new alkaline bands after vaccination was observed. Furthermore, in subjects with absence of detectable natural antibodies, the vaccine-induced antibody response started in correspondence of alkaline pH areas, subsequently extending to neutral and acidic areas. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that alkaline antibody-secreting B cell clones are the first to be recruited. The final spectrotype in these subjects was similar to that observed in subjects with naturally acquired antibodies. This observation, together with the above reported data, allow us to conclude that natural (T-dependent pathway) and vaccine (T-independent pathway) immunization induce the expression of the same antibody repertoire, for both meningococcal PSA and PSC. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The predominant antioxidant in LDL is alpha-tocopherol, with an average of 6 molecules in each LDL particle. The other substances with potential antioxidant activity are: gamma-tocopherol, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lycopene, cryptoxanthin, cantaxanthin, phytofluene and ubiquinol-10. Each is present in amounts of only 1/20th to 1/300th of that of alpha-tocopherol. If LDL is exposed to oxidative conditions (Cu++ ions, macrophages) a lag phase precedes the oxidation of PUFAs. During the lag phase the antioxidants disappear with alpha-tocopherol the first to go and beta-carotene the last. The lag phase, which can readily be determined, is an index of the oxidation resistance of LDL. If LDL is loaded with vitamin E in vitro its oxidation resistance increases linearly with its alpha-tocopherol content according to the equation, y = kx+a. The same relationship is applicable if the alpha-tocopherol content of LDL is increased by taking oral vitamin E. Daily doses of 150, 225, 800 and 1200 IU RRR-alpha-tocopherol increased the LDL alpha-tocopherol on average to 138%, 158%, 144% and 215% of the initial value, the oxidation resistance being increased to 118%, 156%, 135% and 175%, respectively. The efficiency of vitamin E-dependent (= k) and the vitamin independent (= a) oxidation resistance seem to be subject specific with strong individual variation.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

No immunoreactivity was detected in extracts of stomach and skin. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of each tissue extract resolved a single immunoreactive peptide with identical retention time in each case. The immunoreactive peptide was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC from brain extracts and an N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue was successfully removed enzymatically. The molecular mass of des(pyroglutamyl) frog NT, determined by plasma desorption mass spectroscopy, was 1440 Da. The primary structure of this peptide was determined by gas-phase sequencing and the calculated molecular mass, 1440.7 Da, was in close agreement with that derived by mass spectroscopy. The full primary structure of frog NT was established as: QSHISKARRPYIL. When compared with bovine NT, frog NT exhibits five amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence (RRPYIL), which mediates the classical biological effects of NT, is completely conserved. Amphibia thus possess a tridecapeptide NT which is analogous to that of higher vertebrates and considerable constraints on the primary structure of the C-terminal biologically-active core have existed for a vast evolutionary time span. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Treatments were allocated at random in a double-blind manner: 113 patients received 5000 IU of standard heparin t.d.s.; 124 patients received enoxaparin 40 mg once a day. Treatment lasted from 10 to 15 days until bilateral ascending phlebography of the lower limbs (BAPLL) was performed. Its effectiveness was assessed by the results of BAPLL, by evaluation of the risk of bleeding on examination of the surgical wound, by the units of blood required for perfusion and by daily blood count and differential. BAPLL was performed in 228 patients: 15 phlebographies (12.5 p. 100) were positive in the 120 assessed patients of the enoxaparin group, while 27 (25 p. 100) were positive in the 108 assessed patients of the standard heparin group (p = 0.014). Proximal deep vein thrombosis was significantly (p = 0.03) less frequent in the enoxaparin group (7.5 p. 100) than in the standard heparin group (18.5 p. 100). Pulmonary embolism was observed in a patient on standard heparin. The units of blood required for perfusion were significantly (p = 0.03) smaller in the enoxaparin group (3.37 +/- 1.81 U) than in the standard heparin group (3.84 +/- 1.70 U).

Light and electron microscopy revealed acute effects of glutamate and aspartate consisting of glial and dendritic swelling and neuronal soma necrosis (\"dark cell degeneration\"). Electron microscopy showed the focal dendritic swelling induced by glutamate or aspartate to be of the axon-sparing type with presynaptic terminals relatively unaffected. Four weeks after injection, irreversible neuron loss and reactive gliosis had occurred. The inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid caused acute glial swelling similar to that caused by glutamate and aspartate but did not produce neurotoxic effects, indicating that glial swelling may not be causally related to neuronal death but may be the result of amino acid uptake. The excitatory non-amino acid acetylcholine produced no direct, periventricular hippocampal damage or glial swelling but did produce dendritic swelling in the CA3 region innervated by the perforant path, presumably as a result of acetylcholine-induced seizure activity in this pathway. Glutamate and aspartate also caused glial and neuronal changes in other periventricular structures, e.g., septum, hypothalamus, caudate and habenula, as well as in the most dorsal portion of the cerebellum. Dendritic swelling induced by glutamate and aspartate in the cerebellar molecular layer was accompanied by acute necrosis of Purkinje cell somata. These results suggest that seizure-associated brain damage is initiated by excessive endogenous excitatory amino acid receptor activation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In addition to systemic vincristine, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, and steroids, these patients received courses of intrathecal methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and hydrocortisone, because of meningeal tumor cell infiltration. Whole brain radiation was also given either before or during intrathecal therapy. Three of the children had a progressive irreversible neurologic illness, which developed either at or shortly after the completion of combined triple intrathecal therapy, death ensuing approximately 2 months later. The neuropathologic lesions consisted of discrete multifocal necroses of coagulative type, apparently extending by confluence, and disseminated in the cerebral white matter in a random manner. In one case, extensive symmetrical demyelinating and necrotizing lesions involved the centrum ovale bilaterally. There was a remarkable absence of inflammatory cellular response and a relative paucity of macrophage reaction, with usually little or no tissue breakdown. In addition to demyelination and glial cell loss, there was striking axonal damage, with conspicuous axonal swelling both within and around the necrotizing lesions. The surrounding white matter showed focal status spongiosus and a moderate astrocytic response. Vascular fibrinoid necrosis was inconstant and, except in one case, rarely observed.

The number of green (newly emerged), empty, blood-fed, and gravid females in each collection was counted; up to 100 empty females were dissected to estimate the abundance of empty, parous females in the population. In general, this species was uncommon during the dry season from January through June but increased during the wet season in July and remained abundant through early winter. During the wet season, green, parous, and gravid females were periodically abundant. Time series analysis demonstrated that green and parous mosquitoes were positively associated through time and that gravid females were associated negatively with daily rainfall. The strongest correlations were recorded in 1985, a year during which St. Louis encephalitis virus was detected with increased frequency in Indian River County. Laboratory experiments in a large outdoor wind tunnel confirmed that high relative humidity was important for the initiation and successful completion of oviposition by gravid, field-collected Cx. nigripalpus mosquitoes. Thus, intermittent rainfall during autumn may serve to delay oviposition, increase longevity, synchronize blood feeding, and enhance transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus by infected mosquitoes in the field. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

They left still unsolved the problem how to obtain better functional results following their surgical treatment. It is well known, that in the group of high- supralevator deformities, the lower rectum, anal canal and internal sphincter are absent, and the terminal pouch lyes above the puborectalis sling. The purpose of the of the pull-through procedure is the reconstruction of proper relationship between bowel, the levator diaphragm and external sphincter, without damage to the muscles and pelvic plexus. The technics advocated by Stephens and Rehbein are apparently important steps forward in surgery of these defects. The sacrococcygeal route of Kraske, adapted by Stephens for operative treatment of anorectal malformations, gives approach from behind to the supralevator space for identification of puborectalis sling. The muscle is separated from urethra or vagina, and gradually the tunnel through the sling and external sphincter is created. The gentle and in proper plane pull of the bowel through an undamaged puborectalis muscle gives the possibility to save its function as rectal sphincter and receptor as well. This paper presents 76 children with anorectal malformations, treated in the Department of Pediatric Surgery during 1966 to 1975 yr. The \"International\" Classification, proposed in Melbourne was used to group the patients according to the level of the terminal bowel: in Supralevator , Intermediate and Translevator defects (tab. I-III). The surgical procedures in particular types of anomalies are presented in the tables IV-VII. The detailed clinical evaluation and roentgenological examination were the base to assess the type of malformation and to choose the method of treatment. To find other coincidental malformations, generally most frequently occurring in the genitourinary tract, the intravenous pyelography was the routine early investigation. Other tests, like cystography and endoscopy were done when indicted. The genitourinary tract abnormalities were found in 9 of 14 children with supralevator deformities, in 9 of 17 children with intermediate type and in 17 of 45 from the translevator group. Oesophageal atresia was present in 6 children, the congenital heart failure in 13 and skeletal malformations in 21 of the total. In neonates with supralevator anomalies the primary reconstructions were not very successful, so transversostomy became a routine preliminary procedure.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Thus we were able to carry out a comparative study of a series of 30 patients who were re-operated on between the 16th of March 1959 and the 16th of March 1966, and 44 patients operated on under the same conditions between the 16th of March 1966 and the 16th of March 1974. The causes of recurrence were different in the two groups. Before 1966, they were mainly due to the choice of inefficacious operations. Since 1966, they are due to poor technique in resection of the junction of the femoral vein with the saphenous vein. This was the most common cause, and these failures were favoured by saphenous abnormalities. Associated with stripping of the large vessels, resection of inguinal cavernoma which prolonged the femoro-saphenous junction, was the main stage in these re-operations. It was perfectly efficacious in the treatment of varicose veins but required also resection of inguinal lymph nodes with the cavernoma. Post-operative complications, such as lymphatic fistula and oedema, led us to prefer simple isolation of the cavernoma from the deep veins, but the first and essential stage remains resection of the junction of the femoral and saphenous veins and stripping of accessory trunks. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Hirugen, the synthetic N-acetylated COOH-terminal dodecapeptide (Ac-Asn-Gly-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr(SO3)-Leu) of hirudin was shown in the present study to behave as a pure competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.54 microM) of human alpha-thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptide A from human fibrinogen. In contrast to this inhibitory activity, hirugen slightly enhanced (increased kcat/Km 1.6-fold) alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic tripeptide substrate N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. These observations indicate that hirugen binds to alpha-thrombin at an exosite distinct from the active site, and that interaction with this exosite is a major determinant of the competence of alpha-thrombin to bind fibrinogen. Consistent with this view, hirugen blocked binding of fibrin II to alpha-thrombin. Studies of the effect of hirugen on the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by antithrombin III (AT), the major plasma inhibitor of alpha-thrombin, indicated that binding of hirugen to alpha-thrombin results in less than a 2.5-fold decrease in the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by AT, both in the absence and presence of heparin. This behavior is distinct from that of active site-directed competitive inhibitors of alpha-thrombin which bind to alpha-thrombin and block both conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and inactivation of alpha-thrombin by AT. Hirugen, an exosite-directed competitive inhibitor, blocks the interaction of alpha-thrombin with fibrinogen while leaving alpha-thrombin competent to react with AT. Thus, unlike active site-directed competitive inhibitors, hirugen should act in concert with AT and heparin to reduce the amount of fibrinogen that is processed during the lifetime of alpha-thrombin in plasma. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The activity of GlcNAc-T III was determined in Triton X-100 extracts of four human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B-cell lines, in four T-cell lines originally established from lymphocytes of patients with acute lymphatic leukemia, and in human tonsillar B and T lymphocytes. The four EBV-transformed B-cell lines showed appreciable GlcNAc-T III activities (ranging from 3.4 to 19.0 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1), while the tonsillar resting B lymphocytes had much less activity (0.68 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1). The four T-cell lines and the tonsillar T lymphocytes had negligible GlcNAc-T III activities (ranging from 0.02 to 0.25 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1). Enzyme product was identified by high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and methylation analysis. This is the first demonstration of GlcNAc-T III activity in human lymphocytes. The presence of GlcNAc-T III in B-cell lines correlates with the reported occurrence of bisecting GlcNAc residues in the oligosaccharides of human immunoglobulins G, A1, M, and D, tonsillar class II antigens, and membrane glycoproteins from B lymphocytes. The negligible GlcNAc-T III activity of the four human T-cell lines and of tonsillar T lymphocytes agrees with the reported absence of bisected structures in N-glycans from human T lymphocyte membrane glycoproteins. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To investigate the importance of this, we evaluated right and left ventricular function in 21 patients after anatomical correction and in 21 patients after Mustard or Senning operations. First-pass and equilibrium-gated radionuclide angiography were used to measure right and left ventricular ejection fractions between 17 and 78 (mean, 47) months after anatomical correction and between 3 and 187 (mean, 67) months after intra-atrial repair. The mean age of the patient groups at the time of study was 52 and 84 months, respectively. The right ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 35% to 78% (mean, 58%) in patients after anatomical correction and from 27% to 68% (mean, 51%) after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.066). The left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 39% to 74% (mean, 58%) after anatomical correction and from 35% to 74% (mean, 58%) after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.86). The mean right and left ventricular ejection fractions of both groups were significantly lower than those of normal children. Individuals with systemic ventricular dysfunction were identified after both types of operations; however, symptomatic dysfunction occurred only after intra-atrial repair (p = 0.24). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Because the endothelium plays a major role in the regulation of vascular tone and hemostasis, a study was conducted of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) incubated with various Hbs. Cell injury was evaluated by electron microscopy and the release of lactic dehydrogenase, H2O2, and procoagulant \"tissue factor.\" Cell reaction was assessed by the measurement of 6-keto-prostaglandin F (PGF)1 alpha (metabolite of prostacyclin) and thromboxane B2 (metabolite of thromboxane A2). Incubation with unmodified bovine hemoglobin for 24 h caused no cell injury and a reaction characterized by 48.4 +/- 8.2% increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production, accompanied by 40.2 +/- 9.4% reduction in thromboxane (Tx)B2 (compared with a control group of EC incubated with saline solution). Incubation with a nonpure Hb solution (Hb plus red blood cell membrane aminophospholipids; a-PLs) caused cell injury with significant release of tissue factor, plus a reaction characterized by 97.5 +/- 12.5% increase in TxB2 production accompanied by 25.3 +/- 3% reduction in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. A second nonpure Hb [Hb plus bacterial environmental endotoxin (E)] caused cell injury, the release of tissue factor, and increased production of both prostaglandins, with greater release of TxB2 (197 +/- 17%) than of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (112 +/- 8.3%). These data indicate that the endothelium reacts differently to pure and nonpure hemoglobins. The biocompatibility of Hb solutions, with regard to vasoconstriction and activation of intravascular coagulation, depends on the absence of stromal a-PLs and bacterial E. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Purified enzyme was homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugal analysis and was most active at pH 7.8 using Gly-Pro beta-napthylamide as substrate. The Km values for Gly-Pro beta-naphthylamide and Ala-Ala beta-naphthylamide were 0.63 and 0.77 mM, respectively. The proline-containing peptides were hydrolysed more than 10-fold faster. By isoelectric focusing a pI of 4.9 was determined. The enzyme was estimated to be 230 000 +/- 15 000 by the sedimentation equilibrium method and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicating that the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits with molecular weights of 115 000. It was inhibited by the active-site directed, irreversible inhibitor diisopropylphosphorofluorofluoridate. Post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, in contrast to the endopeptidase post-proline cleaving enzyme [9,10] (Walter R. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 422, 138-158, and Koida, M. and Walter, R. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7593-7599) exhibits no endopeptidase activity. Instead it is an exopeptidase with a high specificity for NH2-terminal-free peptides containing a proline residue in the penultimate position and releases the dipeptide with proline being the COOH-terminal moiety. The name \"post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase\" is suggested. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Among the most useful conceptually has been the discovery that there are two classes of modulatory neurons in the RVM that are likely to have opposing actions on nociception: on-cells, which may facilitate nociceptive transmission, and off-cells, which probably have a net inhibitory effect on nociception. The similarity in response properties among the members of each class, their large, somatic \"receptive fields,\" and the wide distribution of the terminal fields of axons of individual neurons to the trigeminal sensory complex and to multiple spinal segments indicate that these neurons exert a global influence over nociceptive responsiveness. Drug microinjections into the RVM presumably shift the balance between states of on- or off-cell firing and also produce measurable changes in the threshold for nocifensor reflexes. The meaningful unit of function in the RVM nociceptive modulatory system therefore probably consists of large ensembles of physiologically and pharmacologically similar neurons. The strong coordination of activity of the two classes of RVM neuron may depend largely upon intranuclear projections from RVM off-cells that excite other off-cells and inhibit on-cells. The off-cell pause is GABA-mediated, and it is likely that there is a subset of GABA-containing RVM on-cells that directly inhibit off-cells. Furthermore, the available evidence indicates that exogenous opiates activate off-cells by inhibiting GABAergic release. Presumably, enkephalinergic cells in the RVM disinhibit off-cells in a similar way. Although non-serotonin-containing off-cells certainly exist, we propose that some off-cells contain serotonin. Other possible connections are based on more limited data; however, ACh, neurotensin, NE, and EAAs are present in neurons that project to the RVM, and each of these compounds, when microinjected into the RVM, has a modulating effect on nociceptive transmission. The local circuits in the RVM that underlie these actions remain to be elucidated. At the level of the dorsal horn, there is good evidence for each of three inhibitory mechanisms: direct inhibition of nociceptive projection neurons, inhibition of excitatory relay interneurons, and excitation of an inhibitory interneuron. The relative contribution made by each of these circuits is unknown.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Putative phosphorylations were detected by charge alterations in proteins labeled with 35S--methionine and, in some cases, confirmed by labeling with 32P--phosphate. We assessed the relative stabilities of proteins affected by cAMP, the periods of susceptibility of proteins to cAMP-dependent modification and any cAMP-mediated changes in protein synthesis or stability. Five proteins (of about 650 resolved) behave as expected for \"orthodox\" substrates of a cAMP-activated protein kinase: both newly synthesized and prelabeled forms of these proteins are subject to modification; this modification involves an acidic charge shift of about one unit; and cAMP-mediated conversion of these proteins to their modified forms is virtually complete. The acidic forms of at least three of these proteins also exhibit cAMP-mediated increases in 32P--phosphate incorporation. Each protein comprised less than approximately 0.005% of cellular protein. Under basal conditions they appear to be phosphorylated to an extent about 20--30% of that found in fully stimulated cells. Nine proteins show cAMP-dependent changes in rates of synthesis with six inductions and three repressions. Most of these changes are of a magnitude of about 3 to 5 fold, and reach their maximal extents after about 4--5 hr of exposure to dibutyryl cAMP. In addition to the phosphorylations, inductions and repressions mentioned above, approximately 12 other reproducible cAMP-dependent changes in protein patterns are observed. Mutant cell lines deficient in catalytic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase show none of the changes in protein pattern attributable to cAMP. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Action potentials were recorded from filaments of the right cervical vagus in anaesthetized, paralysed cats. Right atrial receptors with type A (twelve units) and Intermediate type (two units) patterns of spontaneous discharge were selected and their responses to changes in atrial volume were analysed. 2. Changes in atrial volume of similar magnitude were produced under four different conditions: a, innervated hearts; b, denervated hearts; c, depression of atrial muscle contractility induced after cardiac denervation and d, non-beating hearts. 3. In innervated hearts the systolic discharge of each receptor showed a characteristic response to changes in atrial volume. Cardiac denervation and depression of atrial contractility markedly altered this response in terms of frequency of discharge threshold and 'sensitivity'. 4. During increments in atrial volume all the receptors but one assumed an Intermediate pattern of discharge. The diastolic firing rate was, however, higher for any given atrial pressure, in innervated hearts than under conditions b, c and d. 5. In innervated hearts the response of the receptors to atrial systole was characterized by a higher frequency of discharge and a lower threshold with respect to the responses of the same receptors to atrial filling. These differences were minimized at high atrial volumes and during depression of atrial contractility. 6. The results indicate that the responses of the receptors to atrial systole are mainly dependent upon the state of contraction of atrial muscle and that the differences between systolic and diastolic discharge are mainly due to the high dynamic component of the stretch during atrial contraction. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Since the introduction of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist treatment for LHRH-dependent precocious hormone (LHRH) agonist treatment for LHRH-dependent precocious puberty in 1979, several reports have shown increased predicted height among LHRH agonist-treated children. To determine whether the LHRH agonist deslorelin can normalize the adult height of children with precocious puberty, we are conducting a long-term pilot study involving 161 children. This report describes the first 44 children to have attained final or proximate adult height. These children were 7.1 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) yr old (bone age 11.8 +/- 1.5 yr) and had been in puberty for 3.1 +/- 0.3 yr at the start of treatment. They were treated with deslorelin (4 micrograms/kg/day sc) for 4.1 +/- 1.3 yr and had been withdrawn from treatment for an average of 2.4 yr at the time of this study (age 13.6 +/- 0.9 yr). Fourteen of the 44 children, who had grown less than 0.5 cm during the previous year, were considered to have attained adult height. The other 30 children had achieved 98.6% of predicted mature height (Bayley-Pinneau method) and were considered to be at proximate adult height. The final or proximate adult height of these 44 children averaged -1.1 SD compared to the adult height of the normal population. This height was significantly greater than the pretreatment height (-1.1 vs. -2.0 SD, P less than 0.01), but significantly less than both the predicted height at the end of treatment (-1.1 vs. -0.5 SD, P less than 0.01) and the target height derived from the mean height of the parents adjusted for the sex of the child (-1.1 vs. 0.1 SD, P less than 0.01). The observation that the Bayley-Pinneau height prediction at the end of treatment overestimated the actual adult height emphasizes the importance of using final height data to assess the ultimate impact of LHRH agonist treatment. It also indicates the need for caution when predicting the adult height of children who are still receiving treatment. We conclude that deslorelin has improved the adult height of these patients but has not fully restored height to the patients' genetic potential. We hypothesize that further improvement will be seen in patients who are treated with less delay and at a younger bone age. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In addition to the clinical observations, each infant was studied in a sleep laboratory during a complete nap, and a continuous recording was made of respiratory activity and rapid eye movements. Measurements were made of all apneic pauses (greater than or equal to 2 seconds) observed in the laboratory and the two groups of infants were compared in terms of the frequency and average duration of apneic pauses, the longest apneic pause, the amount of periodic apnea, and the relative amount of apnea. The infants with prolonged sleep apnea had, during a single nap, more frequent and longer apneic pauses and more periodic apnea. This supports the hypothesis that respiratory instability during sleep and prolonged apnea have a common etiology. By employing a multiple linear regression model and including all laboratory apnea measures in a single analysis, a composite laboratory score was developed to differentiate members of the two groups. It would thus appear that the study of infants during a single nap could assist in the identification of infants at risk for prolonged sleep apnea and provide an indirect method for determining the influence of a number of variables on the occurrence of prolonged sleep apnea.

Since July 1989, 104 patients underwent myocardial revascularization using 122 RA grafts (18 patients received two grafts). The left internal mammary artery (IMA) was concomitantly used as a pedicled graft in 100 cases and the right IMA in 19 cases; a free IMA graft was used in 29 cases and a saphenous vein graft in 24 cases. A mean of 2.8 grafts per patient were performed. Nine patients underwent associated procedures: carotid endarterectomy (3), aortic valve replacement (3), Bigelow procedure (1), and mitral valve repair (2). The target artery receiving the RA was the circumflex (n = 59), diagonal (n = 29), right coronary (n = 27), and left anterior descending (n = 7). One patient died (0.96%) and 2 had perioperative myocardial infarct. Sternal wound infection was noted in 3 cases of double IMA implantation. No ischemia of the hand was observed. All patients received diltiazem started intraoperatively and continued after discharge. In addition aspirin (100 mg/day) was given at discharge. Early angiographic controls (less than 2 weeks) were obtained in the first 50 consecutive patients and revealed 56 of 56 patent RA grafts, 48 of 48 patent left IMA grafts, 11 of 11 patent right IMA grafts, 14 of 18 patent free IMA grafts, and 8 of 9 patent vein grafts.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

I examine the bias in the attributable and the prevented fraction derived from a risk ratio estimate as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the outcome classification, the true risk ratio, the prevalence of the exposure, and the baseline disease frequency. With outcome misclassified, disease frequency is an important determinant of the magnitude of the bias; the rarer the disease, the more severe is the bias. For both the attributable and the prevented fraction, the specificity of the outcome classification has a greater influence on the magnitude of the bias than the sensitivity; this is in contrast to the dominant effect of sensitivity in situations of exposure misclassification. Also, unlike the findings in the exposure misclassification, the bias due to outcome misclassification does not increase monotonically with increased prevalence of exposure. For the attributable and prevented fraction derived from an odds ratio estimate, the specificity of the outcome classification does not have a greater influence on bias than the sensitivity, and a perfect specificity alone does not lead to unbiased effect estimates if the sensitivity of the outcome classification is imperfect. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Infections due to C. neoformans are increased in patients with AIDS who are deficient in the CD4+ subset of T lymphocytes. Thus, the effect of CD4+ (L3T4+) lymphocyte depletion on murine host defenses to C. neoformans was studied. The mAb GK 1.5 was administered to mice, and CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion was confirmed by the analysis of T cell subsets in blood, spleen, lymph node, and lung. Evidence of a functional defect was confirmed by demonstrating that the splenocytes of treated mice were unable to proliferate in response to class II incompatible spleen cells. Furthermore, delayed type hypersensitivity to C. neoformans was abrogated by CD4+ lymphocyte depletion. Mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes were inoculated with a virulent strain of C. neoformans by the i.v. or the intratracheal route. After i.v. inoculation of C. neoformans, the survival of mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes was reduced (27.8 +/- 1.8 vs 36.0 +/- 3.1 days, p less than 0.04). After intratracheal inoculation, C. neoformans disseminated from the lung to extrapulmonary organs. Dissemination occurred earlier in mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes compared to mice that received control antibody, and the burden of C. neoformans in extrapulmonary organs was greater in mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes than control mice. Surprisingly, there was no increase in the burden of C. neoformans in the lungs of CD4+ lymphocyte-depleted mice. Survival of mice inoculated with C. neoformans and depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes was reduced compared to control mice and was related to the increased rate of accumulation of organisms in the brains of treated mice. The mean survival of GK 1.5-treated mice was 34.1 +/- 0.9 days compared to control mice with a mean survival of 40.6 +/- 9 days (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that CD4+ lymphocytes play a prominent role in the host defense of infections due to C. neoformans, that CD4+ lymphocytes are required in extrapulmonary organs for optimal clearance of C. neoformans and that CD4+ lymphocytes are critical for survival of mice infected with C. neoformans. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Concentrations of total fibers (coated and uncoated) (LM), crocidolite, amosite, chrysotile, and unidentified amphibole (TEM) (fibers/g dry lung tissue) were measured. Fiber concentrations less than 10 microns in length and greater than or equal to 10 microns in length were separately quantified. By comparing cases (221) and controls (359 LM, 103 TEM), odds ratios for increasing fiber concentrations compared with less than 15,000 fibers/g (LM) and less than 200,000 fibers/g (TEM) (the respective detection limits) were calculated. Univariate analyses showed statistically significant dose-response relationships between odds ratio and fiber concentration for all fiber concentration measures. The relationship between log(odds ratio) and log(fiber concentration) was linear. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, amosite less than 10 microns, and chrysotile less than 10 microns as explanatory variables best described the data. The odds ratios for a X10 increase in fiber concentration (fibers/micrograms) were as follows: crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, 29.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 241); chrysotile less than 10 microns, 15.7 (95% CI, 6.1 to 40); amosite less than 10 microns, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.3). An additive risk model gave similar results. In a subgroup of cases and controls with only chrysotile in the lungs, a significant trend in odds ratio with increasing fiber content was found. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Flow cytometry has proven to be a useful tool for the analysis of eukaryotic cells. In the present investigation, the utility of this technology for the enumeration of bacteria in mixtures was explored. Rabbit antisera were produced against the putative periodontal pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, B. gingivalis, E. corrodens, W. recta, B. forsythus, as well as the frequently isolated supragingival species S. sanguis. Cross-reactive antibodies were removed by absorption, and the specificity of each antiserum was confirmed by being tested against a panel of 235 oral microbial strains (79 genera; 94 species) by means of ELISA. Conditions were established for the indirect immunofluorescent labeling of cells without agglutination with use of a goat anti-rabbit Ig-FITC second antibody. When an internal bead standard was used, it was found that unstained bacteria were enumerated by light-scattering parameters with poor efficiency (less than 3%). However, cells exposed to FITC either in the presence of specific or non-specific first antibody were enumerated with high efficiency (102.6 +/- 29.3%), indicating that a small amount of non-specific binding of fluorochrome facilitates bacterial detection. Clear discrimination between specifically- and non-specifically-stained bacteria was achieved with all six rabbit antisera. Mixtures of known composition were made (1) with pure cultures or (2) with a known species and supragingival plaque devoid of that species by culture. The results from both approaches with various species combinations revealed that the limit of resolution for accurate quantitation of a selected species was approximately 5%, although specific organisms could be detected qualitatively when present at approximately 1%. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To study the contribution of extracellular superoxide anion (O2-) to CNS O2 toxicity we constructed transgenic mice overexpressing human extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD; superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) in the brain. Remarkably, when exposed to 6 atm (1 atm = 101.3 kPA) of hyperbaric oxygen for 25 min, transgenic mice demonstrated higher mortality (83%) than nontransgenic litter-mates (33%; P < 0.017). Pretreatment with diethyldithiocarbamate, which inhibits both ECSOD and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) activity, increased resistance to CNS O2 toxicity, in terms of both survival (100% in transgenics and 93% in nontransgenics) and resistance to seizures (4-fold increase in seizure latency in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice; P < 0.05). Thus, O2- apparently protects against CNS O2 toxicity. We hypothesized that O2- decreased toxicity by inactivating nitric oxide (NO.). To test this, we inhibited NO. synthase (EC 1.14.23) with N omega-nitro-L-arginine to determine whether NO. contributes to enhanced CNS O2 toxicity in transgenic mice. N omega-nitro-L-arginine protected both transgenic and nontransgenic mice against CNS O2 toxicity (100% survival and a 4-fold delay in time to first seizure; P < 0.05), as well as abolishing the difference in sensitivity to CNS O2 toxicity between transgenic and nontransgenic mice. These results implicate NO. as an important mediator in CNS O2 toxicity and suggest that ECSOD increases CNS O2 toxicity by inhibiting O2(-)-mediated inactivation of NO. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

PKC appeared to phosphorylate the same sites of the subunits present in the form of the troponin complex, as indicated by the similarity in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Although some of the phosphorylation sites were shared by other classes of protein kinases, PKC exhibited a distinct substrate specificity. It was also noted that phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in Tn-I and Tn-T had neighboring basic amino acid residues separated by 1 or 2 other residues both at the amino and carboxyl termini, in agreement with the conclusion of House et al. (House, C., Wettenhall, R. E. H., and Kemp, B. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 772-777) based upon their studies on other substrate proteins. Several peptides having sequences around the phosphorylating sites have been synthesized. The phosphorylation experiments indicated that these peptides were substrates for PKC, and their relative substrate activity (determined by the ratios of Vmax/Km) compared with other proteins, in descending order, was Tn-I = Tn-I(134-154) greater than Tn-T much greater than histone H1 greater than Tn-I(33-35) approximately Tn-T(268-284) greater than Tn-T(179-198) approximately Tn-T(191-209). It is suggested that PKC phosphorylation of Tn-I and Tn-T could be biologically significant in terms of possible modifications in interactions among the individual contractile protein components as well as the Ca2+ sensitivity and activity of actomyosin ATPase. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Experiments designed to elucidate the reasons underlying these differences have revealed that the response of the spleen cells to con A is determined by a complex interplay between several cell types. (a) B cells contribute to the overall incorporation of thymidine in the presence of con A-stimulated T cells. However, the B cells participate in the response only if the T cells are dividing. (b) A population of 'adherent cells' is present in the spleen, which enhances the stimulation of the spleen cells by low doses of con A but suppresses the response to high doses of mitogen. These adherent cells include most likely the conventional macrophages, but probably also a population of 'suppressor T cells'. (c) Such 'suppressor T' cells can be readily detected among the peritoneal exudate cells. Addition of the exudate cells to cultures of purified T cells enhances the response to low doses of con A. This effect can be further increased by treating the peritoneal cells with a cell T-specific antiserum and complement, i.e. by eliminating the T cells. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

PB pretreatment increased survival and BNF pretreatment increased mortality in both the NS and AR lines when a single oral dose of aflatoxin was administered. The rate of in vitro metabolism of AFB1 was greater with microsomes from saline pretreated AR chicks than with microsomes from similarly treated NS chicks. In vivo pretreatment with PB increased AFB1 metabolism by NS and AR microsomes. After BNF pretreatment of vivo, AR microsomes metabolized more AFB1 than NS microsomes, and there was a dramatic decrease in AFB1 metabolism in NS microsomes. AFB1-dihydrodiol was the major metabolite produced by both lines, with aflatoxin M1 and aflatoxin Q1 recovered in small quantities from BNF-pretreated AR microsomal incubations only. These data indicate that increased in vivo resistance of the AR line to acute aflatoxicosis may be related to increased hepatic AFB1 metabolism and that genetic selection has resulted in altered in vitro quantitative and qualitative metabolism of AFB1 in the AR line. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

For most derivatives, penicillinase activity was 10% or less than that of strains making TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamase, suggesting that reduced catalytic efficiency accompanied the broader substrate spectrum. Despite this deficit, resistance to aztreonam, carumonam, cefdinir, cefepime, cefixime, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and E1040 was enhanced. For strains producing TEM-type enzymes, however, MICs of carumonam, cefepime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, and ceftibuten were 8 micrograms/ml or less. Susceptibilities of cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, flomoxef, imipenem, meropenem, moxalactam, temocillin, FCE 22101, and Sch 34343 were unaffected. FCE 22101, imipenem, meropenem, and Sch 34343 were inhibitory for all strains at 1 microgram/ml or less. In E. coli an OmpF- porin mutation in combination with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enhanced resistance to many of these agents, but generally by only fourfold. Hyperproduction of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase increased resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams but not that to temocillin. When tested at 8 micrograms/ml, clavulanate was more potent than sulbactam or tazobactam in overcoming resistance to ampicillin, while cefoperazone-sulbactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, especially against TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Air embolism caused transient ischemia of the brain, reaching a maximum within 1 min after injection. Resolution of the air embolism began a few minutes later and was completed within 15 min in the center and within 30 min in the border zone of the main supplying arteries. During this phase tissue perfusion was inhomogenous with reduced flow rates in some areas and reactive hyperemia up to 300% in others. This resulted in venous hyperoxia and a decrease of arteriovenous oxygen difference to as low as 2 ml/100 ml blood. Reactive hyperemia was accompanied by brain swelling and an increase in intracranial pressure from 3.6 +/- 1.2 to 12.3 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. The reason for hyperemia was a decrease of cortical pH which fell from 7.33 +/- 0.03 to 7.03 +/- 0.05, and which caused a dilation of pial arteries up to 260%. Immediately after embolism, the EEG flattened and oxygen consumption decreased. After normalization of flow, oxygen consumption returned to normal, but EEG only partially recovered. Air embolism had little effect on the water and electrolyte content of the brain, and produced very little damage to the blood-brain barrier. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

One particular element of this pattern, the investigative behaviour, was found to be sensitive to drugs acting on both noradrenaline and dopamine receptors. An increase in investigative activity (IA) and a slight decrease in the other exploratory (OE) activity was caused by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The alpha 2-receptor agonists clonidine and B-HT 933 decreased both the IA and the OE activity. These effects were counteracted by yohimbine. Activation of presynaptic dopamine receptors by low doses of apomorphine (less than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg) and B-HT 920 resulted in significant increase in IA and a decrease in OE activity. Higher doses of apomorphine (0.7 and 1.0 mg/kg) decreased or abolished IA but increased OE activity. We assume this effect to be due to postsynaptic receptor stimulation. Pretreatment with haloperidol counteracted the effects of apomorphine and B-HT 920. An increase in IA is probably due to a decrease in dopaminergic activity, which can be induced by presynaptic receptor activation. The decrease in IA after presynaptic noradrenergic stimulation cannot at present, however, be related to a specific influence, since the possibility of general effects on locomotion cannot be ruled out. The increase in IA observed after presynaptic dopaminergic activation and the fixed-interval recording procedure may be valuable instruments in the search for selectively acting compounds with dopaminergic activity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Namely, eight tumor markers, CA125, SLX, CA72-4, TPA, Fr, CEA, CA19-9, and SCC, were determined and studied to find the combination that would yield the optimal diagnostic value. For this purpose, the diagnostic value was calculated from sensitivity x specificity. As a single tumor marker CA125 proved optimal with a diagnostic value of 0.50. The higher value, 0.53, was obtained as the diagnostic value from the combination of two tumor markers, CA125 and CA72-4. When three tumor markers were combined, CA125, CA72-4 and SLX gave an optimal diagnostic value of 0.65. In the combination of four tumor markers, CA125, CA72-4, SLX and CA19-9 gave a diagnostic value of 0.63. In the five marker combination CA125, CA72-4, SLX, CA19-9 and TPA worked well and had a diagnostic value of 0.59. When the markers were increased to six types, CA125, CA72-4, SLX, CA19-9, TPA and Fr provided a combination with 0.53 as the diagnostic value. In the seven marker combination CA125, CA72-4, SLX, CA19-9, TPA, Fr and CEA gave a diagnostic value of 0.51. The efficiency declined to 0.51 when eight tumor markers were combined. When cost performance in the measurement of tumor markers for early detection of ovarian cancer is taken into account, a dilemma arises in that the increase in the number of tumor markers used is accompanied by higher sensitivity and lower specificity.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These interactions reorganize the topographic distribution of the receptors at the cell surface and are relayed to the cytoplasm and even to the cell nucleus. Coordinated organization of the intracellular cytoskeleton, cell spreading on the matrix, and movement of the cells along concentration gradients of these matrix molecules are the result of these interactions. Evidence exists that the migration of embryonic cells, platelet activation on endothelial defects, and the invasion of fibroblasts, lymphoid cells, and epithelial cells during wound healing are facilitated by Integrin-matrix interactions. Moreover, deficiency in the synthesis of a particular Integrin subunit or the inappropriate expression of one or a few members of this family might contribute fundamentally to invasion and metastasis of malignant cells. Although extensive information is available on the structure of the common beta 1 subunit and on the function of the fibronectin receptor, in particular, the other five members of the very late antigen family, their respective alpha subunits and their function as cell surface receptors remain poorly understood. The rationale for having at least six different receptors on some cells, how they might collaborate, and to what end remains unknown. Finally, the interaction of these cell surface receptors and the modulation of their affinity for their ligand by other cell surface or extracellular matrix components such as heparan sulfate, gangliosides a.o. have been barely touched upon. It can be predicted that these molecules and their interaction with the extracellular matrix will provide a key to the understanding of many normal and malignant morphogenetic cellular properties. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By 1.5 mm-thick slice scan, the catheters were defined as 6 separate lines. The profile images suggested that 1.5 mm-thick slice scan enables delineation of more minute details of structures. 2) In an experiment using an inflated fixed lung, 1.5 mm-thick slice scan produced more informative images that resembled macroscopic or soft X-ray images. 3) By 1.5 mm-thick slice scan, the subsegmental bronchi of both the right and left lobes were identified in most cases, while identification was possible in only half the cases by 10 mm-thick slice scan. 4) By 10 mm-thick slice scan, the sub-subsegmental bronchi were not identified in most cases. However, identification was possible in approximately half the cases by 1.5 mm-thick slice scan. 5) By 1.5 mm-thick slice scan, the major fissure was delineated as a linear shadow in most cases. It was hardly recognizable by 10 mm-thick slice scan. 6) In diffuse pulmonary diseases, 1.5 mm-thick slice scan allowed more minute visualization of the patho-morphological changes compared to 10 mm-thick slice scan. 7) Thin-slice high-resolution CT is thus expected to contribute to pathological analysis and more accurate diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The selection of sites for alteration was based on the three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic structure (Schevitz, R. W., Otwinowski, Z., Joachimiak, A., Lawson, C. L., and Sigler, P. B. (1985) Nature 317, 782-786). The changes generated include Thr-44 to Ala (T44A), Arg-54 to Leu (R54L), Arg-54 to Lys (R54K), Arg-84 to Leu (R84L), and Arg-84 to Lys (R84K). The mutant proteins were purified and characterized in detail for their binding properties. Both tryptophan and operator DNA affinities for all five mutants were decreased. The R84L, R54K, and R54L mutants exhibited increases in Kd for operator DNA relative to wild-type repressor ranging from approximately 10(3) to approximately 10(4), while R84K and T44A exhibited increases of 10- to 100-fold. This diminution in DNA binding activity derives at least in part from diminished affinity for tryptophan, although decreased affinity for nonspecific DNA was also observed for these mutant proteins. Tryptophan binding was not detectable by equilibrium dialysis for most of the mutant proteins, but this activity was measurable for several of the altered proteins by monitoring the fluorescence decrease associated with the displacement of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate from the tryptophan-binding site (Chou, W.-Y., and Matthews, K. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18314-18319). These measurements revealed that tryptophan bound to R84K, T44A, and R84L repressors with Kd values 1.5- to 13-fold higher than that for wild-type repressor. It was not possible to detect tryptophan binding to R54K and R54L even using the fluorescence assay. Circular dichroism spectra demonstrated that the mutants and the wild-type repressor possess similar secondary structural features. The results of this selected substitution in the tryptophan-binding site are readily interpreted based on the x-ray structural analysis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Plasma extravasation was induced in the knee joint of the rat by continuous perfusion of either bradykinin (160 ng/ml), an inflammatory mediator produced at sites of tissue injury, that produces plasma extravasation significantly dependent on the sympathetic postganglionic neuron, or capsaicin (5 mg/ml), a C-fiber excitotoxin, that induces plasma extravasation that is dependent on both primary afferents and sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons. When selective delta-((d-Pen2,5)-enkephalin) or kappa-(trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2-(- pyrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide; U50,488H) opioid agonists were perfused with bradykinin, plasma extravasation was significantly attenuated. Co-perfusion of the non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone (1 microM), reversed this opioid-induced inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation. In contrast, co-perfusion of a selective mu-opioid agonist (Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol) did not reduce bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation. Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol was, however, able to completely inhibit the plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin. These results suggest that delta- and kappa-, but not mu-selective opioids inhibit bradykinin-stimulated plasma extravasation, while a mu-selective opioid inhibits primary afferent-dependent plasma extravasation. Therefore, inhibition of neurogenic plasma extravasation by receptor-selective opioids may depend on the relative contribution to plasma extravasation of unmyelinated afferent and sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminals. Our findings can also explain, in part, the variation in anti-inflammatory effects of receptor-selective opioids reported in different inflammatory conditions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Thus, we assessed the interrelationship among serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], calcium absorption and intestinal VDR in 44 healthy, ambulatory women, ages 20-87 yr. Fractional calcium absorption was measured after oral administration of 45Ca (20 mg CaCl2 as carrier); serum 1,25-(OH)2D3, by the calf thymus binding assay; and serum intact PTH, by a two-site immunochemiluminometric assay. Vitamin D receptor concentration was measured, by a new immunoradiometric assay, in biopsy specimens taken from the second part of the duodenum during gastroduodenoscopy in 35 of the women. Despite an age-related increase in serum PTH (r = 0.48; P less than 0.001) and in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration (r = 0.32; P less than 0.05), intestinal VDR concentration decreased with age (r = -0.38; P = 0.03) and fractional calcium absorption did not change with age. Although a contribution of decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity to the blunting of the increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration late in life is not excluded, the data are far more consistent with impaired intestinal responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3 action. This defect could lead to compensatory increases in PTH secretion and 1,25-(OH)2D3 production which maintain calcium absorption and serum ionic calcium, but at the expense of increased bone loss. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the preliminary period a 24-hour profile of the peak flow was set up with a morning and evening theophylline level. During the 5-day treatment intervals a 24-hour profile of the serum theophylline levels and of the peak flow was recorded at two-hour intervals. A complete lung function test was performed in each phase. The pharmacokinetic data of both preparations are comparable. Euphylong showed a bioavailability of 83%, the maximum of the serum level was attained at night. Serum level variations were only slightly higher than those of the reference drug.

It was found that the process was not dependent on the presence of monocytes, but was dependent on the presence of T cells. T cell depleted suspensions of tonsillar as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes had markedly diminished if not absent PFC responses following PWM stimulation. The PFC responses of T cell depleted cultures of tonsil and blood could be reconstituted by adding back T cells. T cell supernatants could also reconstitute the PFC response of T cell depleted tonsillar lymphocytes but not of T cell depleted blood lymphocytes, thus suggesting a more stringent T cell requirement of the PWM-induced PFC response of blood lymphocytes. Enrichment for T cells on the other hand enhanced PFC responses in both organs, particularly in those cultures which had low responses in unfractionated suspensions demonstrating the requirement of optimal T cell help for maximal PFC responses. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of this PFC system in elucidating some of the complex regulatory processes associated with the activation of human B lymphocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results indicated that the ovarian tissue immunostained for both TGF-alpha and TGF-beta. The immunostaining for TGF-alpha was associated with oocytes in the primary follicles, granulosa and theca cell layers, as well as small and large luteal cells. The granulosa cell layers in the small follicles were immunostained for TGF-alpha, but there was very little staining association to the theca cell layers. However, the immunostaining intensity increased in both granulosa and theca cell layers as the size of the follicles increased. The ovarian stroma cells always showed moderate immunostaining. In luteal tissue, both small and large luteal cells immunostained for TGF-alpha and the intensity was similar in both cell types. The immunostaining intensity was similar in both early and midluteal phases and was less than that seen in the granulosa-theca cell layers of the large follicles, and decreased in the late luteal phase. Both corpora albicans and ectopic pregnancy corpora lutea showed a weak immunostaining. Immunostaining of ovarian tissues for TGF-beta indicated that the oocytes of the small preantral follicles stained faintly in the cytoplasm; however, they stained strongly around the nuclear periphery. In small, medium, and large follicles granulosa and theca cell layers immunostained with similar intensity for TGF-beta and its intensity increased with follicular size. The ovarian stroma cells also immunostained for TGF-beta, but with a moderate to low intensity compared with other regions. In luteal tissue, both small and large luteal cells immunostained for TGF-beta and its intensity was similar in early and midluteal phases and reduced during the late luteal phase. This immunostaining was reduced as compared to the granulosa-theca cell layers of the follicles. Corpora albicans and ectopic pregnancy corpora lutea also immunostained for TGF-beta; however, the immunostaining intensity was lower than that seen in luteal tissues of early, mid, or late luteal phases.

The oesophageal transit time of aqueous technetium-99m sulfur colloid was determined before and after intravenous infusion of 80 micrograms/kg edrophonium chloride (ED). Patient symptoms during provocative RET (P-RET) were recorded. Thirteen (43%) of the patients had abnormal study results, whereas all control subjects had normal results. Three groups considered abnormal were observed: (a) in two patients (6%), the pain was reproduced and transit pre- and post-ED administration was prolonged (greater than 15 s); (b) in six patients (20%), the pain was reproduced, but transit was normal pre- and post-ED; (c) in five patients (17%), transit pre- and post-ED was prolonged, but no pain was reproduced. In five patients (17%), ED prolonged the transit time greater than 15 s without pain, but the baseline transit was normal. Transit time was measurable in 23 patients. Mean pre-ED transit time was 10.2 +/- 7.4 s (mean +/- SD) and post-ED, 12.4 +/- 8.0 s (P = 0.3). We conclude that ED has no significant effect on transit time, and the pain induced by ED rarely correlates with an abnormal transit; P-RET provides additional information to baseline RET, increasing sensitivity, and may be a useful screening method in the evaluation of patients with NCCP. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We examined all of the peptides for T-helper (Th)-cell recognition and antibody induction in three strains of mice: C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H. Lymphoproliferative and interleukin-2 assays were performed on splenic T cells from mice inoculated with peptides in Freund's incomplete adjuvant or with MVE virus. Several peptides found to contain predicted T-cell epitopes elicited a Th-cell response in at least one strain of mice, usually with a concomitant antibody response. Peptides 145 (amino acids 145 to 169) and 17 (amino acids 356 to 376) were strongly recognized by T cells from all three inbred strains of mice. Peptide 06 (amino acids 230 to 251) primed C57BL/6 mice for Th- and B-cell reactivity with native MVE virus, and T cells from virus-immune mice were stimulated by this peptide. Peptide 06 was recognized by several Th-cell clones prepared from mice immunized with MVE, West Nile, or Kunjin virus. These results indicate that it may be feasible to design synthetic flavivirus peptides that define T-cell epitopes capable of generating a helper cell response for B-cell epitopes involved in protective immunity. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Tetraploid embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant recipients, and these were autopsied either on day 11 or days 15 or 16 of gestation. In the developmentally less advanced group, embryos in which cytogenetic analysis of their extraembryonic membranes confirmed that they had a tetraploid chromosome constitution were analysed histochemically in order to demonstrate the presence of intracellular alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity. This enabled the presence or absence of germ cells to be established. Out of a total of 9 early limb-bud stage embryos studied, all contained primordial germ cells. The latter were mostly located in association with the hindgut, though some germ cells were still present at the base of the allantois. The sex ratio in this group was close to unity. In the 2nd group in which recipients were autopsied on either day 15 or 16 of gestation, a total of 7 healthy tetraploid embryos were recovered. All displayed the characteristic craniofacial features seen in tetraploid embryos. Four of these embryos had a normal postcranial axial morphology, and their crown-rump lengths were only slightly less (81-91%) than those of developmentally matched control diploid embryos. Three of the tetraploid embryos had an abnormal postcranial axis associated with a body wall closure defect involving the anterior abdominal and lower thoracic region. In all 7 of these embryos, gonadal differentiation was consistent with their developmental age. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

For large unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) at 37 degrees C, the fluorescence decay was essentially monoexponential (8.6 and 8.2 ns, respectively) except for a minor component typical of DPH. For gramicidin D reconstituted into DMPC vesicles at a protein/lipid molar ratio of 1/7, the most appropriate analysis of the data was found to be in the form of a bimodal Lorentzian distribution. Centers of the major lifetime components were almost identical with those recovered for vesicles without proteins, while broad distributional widths of some 4.0 ns were recovered. Variation of the protein/lipid molar ratio in sonicated POPC vesicles revealed an abrupt increase in distributional width at ratios approximating 1/15-1/20, which leveled off at about 2.5 ns. For bacteriorhodopsin in DMPC vesicles and cytochrome b5 in POPC, the most appropriate analysis of the data was again found to be in the form of a bimodal Lorentzian also with broad distributional widths in the major component. Lifetime centers were decreased for these proteins due to fluorescence energy transfer to the retinal of the bacteriorhodopsin and heme of the cytochrome b5. Fluorescence energy transfer is distance dependent, and since a range of donor-acceptor distances would be expected in a membrane, lifetime distributions should therefore be recovered independently of other effects for proteins possessing acceptor chromophores.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Arthroscopy on these 52 patients revealed the following; no abnormalities in 37, 11 cases of cartilage lesions, 1 case of medial meniscal tear and 7 cases of LAD tears. 45 patients who have also had their metal implants removed have complaints, arthroscopy revealed the following; hypertrophy of Hoffa's fat pad in 5 cases, 3 cases of medial meniscal tears, 2 cases of lateral meniscal tears. Tears of the LAD were seen in 9 cases. In 2 cases the transplant was missing, in 5 cases the transplant was elongated and in 2 cases the transplant showed normal structure. There were cartilage lesions in 9 cases, 4 cases of synovitis and scar tissue adhesion in 3. In all there were 16 cases of LAD tears, in 9 out of these 16 cases the transplant ACL of good structure. All of this knees were stable. Control arthroscopy is routinely carried out when we remove the metal implants.

The molecular weights of the major M2 antigens in rat liver mitochondria were 67 and 50 kD. Two of the 10 PBC patients did not react to any of these major antigens, eight reacted to the 67-kD and four of those also to the 50-kD antigen. The 67- and 50-kD antigens were present in both plasma membrane and RLM and had affinity to concanavalin A. Antibody reactivity against the 67-kD antigen could be detected in both IgG and IgA as well as in the IgM class. The reactive IgG subclasses to both types of antigen preparations were mainly of the G1 and G3 isotypes. This reactivity was always stronger with antigens from the plasma membrane preparations. Sera from two patients with high antibody titres against mitochondria also reacted with IgG2 against the 50-kD antigen from plasma membrane, but not to the corresponding antigen in mitochondria. Reactivity of antibodies in PBC sera to the periphery of viable hepatocytes and radioactive surface labelling of the 50-kD component are both consistent with a plasma membrane localization of M2. Serum from healthy controls and several patients with different diseases did not contain antibodies reactive against any of the antigens described. We suggest that antigens, partly identical to the mitochondrial M2, are located in the plasma membrane compartment. The PBC pathogenetical consequences of these findings are discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the antigens were bound to the wells of polystyrene microplates, tetanus toxoid directly, and lipopolysaccharide after complexing it with methylated bovine serum albumin. After incubation with dilutions of the rat sera, the amount of antibody bound to the solid phase was quantified by means of peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulin. The specificity of the enzyme immunoassay was tested by absorption of the sera with their respective antigens. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay proved to be more sensitive than the hemagglutination reaction, except when titers were determined during the secondary response to tetanus toxoid. Besides its specificity and sensitivity, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a convenient method for measuring both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies. At low serum dilutions of lipopolysaccharide antisera, inhibition of the reaction in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay occurred. This phenomenon could be prevented by heating the sera at 56 degrees C for 30 min. Lipopolysaccharide was immunogenic in rats over an extremely wide dose range (from 10 pg to 1 mg); the optimal immunogenic dose of lipopolysaccharide for young adult rats was 0.1 to 1,000 mug when administered intravenously, and that of tetanus toxoid was 5 to 10 lines of flocculation, as determined by the Ramon flocculation test. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The nature of the vehicle and of the mycobacterial components administered also has a major influence. It was originally assumed that arthritogenicity and adjuvanticity of mycobacterial fractions such as wax D were intimately related. Our previous findings showed that the water soluble adjuvant (WSA) of M.smegmatis which could substitute for mycobacterial cells in Freund's complete adjuvant and induce delayed hypersensitivity was not arthritogenic in the Wistar rat. We have since observed that auto-immune diseases could be elicited by WSA. Therefore experiments were repeated using the very susceptible Lewis strain. The activity of cord factor and of various mycobacterial preparations suspended in mineral or in peanut oil was also evaluated in mice and in normal or hypophysectomized rats. Our present findings confirm the absence of arthritogenicity of WSA in the Lewis strain. They also indicate that cord factor with WSA does not suffice to induce a generalized adjuvant disease, but that a mycobacterial component which could be susceptible to lysozyme treatment is required also. However, the local inflammation of the injected limb was produced by a preparation of cord factor administered in mineral or even in peanut oil. This was observed in normal or hypophysectomized rats and in Swiss mice which were not susceptible to the generalized disease. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

They relax vascular smooth muscle in vitro, and they dilate renal vessels in vivo. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that they produce hypotension by lowering total peripheral resistance. The studies were performed in conscious chronically instrumented sheep standing quietly in their cages. Atriopeptin II (AP II) was infused into the right atrium for 30 min at 0.1 nmol X kg-1 X min-1. Atriopeptin II lowers arterial pressure (9%, P less than 0.05) by lowering cardiac output (18%, P less than 0.05), stroke volume (28%, P less than 0.05), and right atrial pressure (2.3 mmHg, P less than 0.05). Heart rate and total peripheral resistance increase (16 and 13%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Partial ganglionic blockade with trimethaphan camsylate during AP II infusion prevents the increases in heart rate and total peripheral resistance. The changes in right atrial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output persist, and arterial pressure falls further (27%, P less than 0.05). These hemodynamic data are consistent with direct AP II-induced relaxation of venous smooth muscle with reduction of venous return, right atrial pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, and arterial pressure, followed by reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and total peripheral resistance. Because partial ganglionic blockade alone and AP II alone cause similar reductions in right atrial pressure (2.1 and 2.3 mmHg, respectively) but AP II causes a greater fall in stroke volume (28 vs. 13%), it is possible that AP II also causes coronary vasoconstriction. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The properties of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) in the cyclic AMP-sensitive (S) and cyclic AMP-resistant (R) lymphoma cells were comparatively studied. The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity or R cells cytosol exhibits an apparent Ka for activation by cyclic AMP 100-fold greater than that of the enzyme from the parental S cells. The free regulatory and catalytic subunits from both S and R kinase are thermolabile, when associated in the holoenzyme the two subunits are more stable to heat inactivation in R kinase than in S kinase. The increased heat stability of R kinase is observed however only for the enzyme in which the catalytic and cyclic AMP-binding activities are expressed at high cyclic AMP concentrations (10(-5)--10(-4) M), the activities expressed at low cyclic AMP concentrations (10(-9)--10(-6) M) being thermolabile. The regulatory subunit of S kinase can be stabilized against heat inactivation by cyclic AMP binding both at 2-10(-7) and 10(-5) M cyclic AMP concentrations. In contrast, the regulatory subunit-cyclic AMP complex from R kinase is stable to heat inactivation only when formed in the presence of high cyclic AMP concentrations (10(-5)M). The findings indicate that the transition from a cyclic AMP-sensitive to a cyclic AMP-resistant lymphoma cell phenotype is related to a structural alteration in the regulatory subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase which has affected the protein's affinity for cyclic AMP and its interaction with the catalytic subunit. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

NHBE cells were shown to have high-affinity receptors for TGF-beta. TGF-beta induced the following markers of terminal squamous differentiation in NHBE cells: (i) increase in Ca ionophore-induced formation of crosslinked envelopes; (ii) increase in extracellular activity of plasminogen activator; (iii) irreversible inhibition of DNA synthesis; (iv) decrease in clonal growth rate; and (v) increase in cell surface area. The IgG fraction of anti-TGF-beta antiserum prevented both the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the induction of differentiation by either TGF-beta or whole blood-derived serum. Therefore, TGF-beta is the primary differentiation-inducing factor in serum for NHBE cells. In contrast, TGF-beta did not inhibit DNA synthesis of human lung carcinoma cells even though the cells possess comparable numbers of TGF-beta receptors with similar affinities for the factor. Epinephrine antagonized the TGF-beta-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and squamous differentiation of NHBE cells. Although epinephrine increased the cyclic AMP levels in NHBE cells, TGF-beta did not alter the intracellular level in NHBE cells in either the presence or absence of epinephrine. Therefore, epinephrine and TGF-beta appear to affect different intracellular pathways that control growth and differentiation processes of NHBE cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Resistant clones could be selected with a frequency ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-8) from the parent strain at twice the MIC. The following was observed from the study of six clinical isolates: (a) there was no uniform pattern of cytoplasmic membrane proteins among the isolates; (b) during the phase of growth, the number of high-molecular-weight proteins showed a decrease according to the duration of growth; (c) the addition of 1% w/v glucose to the growth medium resulted in the loss of an approximately 75 kD protein in five of the six strains; (d) subinhibitory concentrations of various antibiotics (1/4 of the MIC) resulted in major changes of cytoplasmic membrane proteins, when the strains were exposed to oxacillin, whereas this was not the case for erythromycin, rifampicin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, fleroxacin and vancomycin; (e) the resistant clones differed from their sensitive parent strains in their cytoplasmic membrane protein patterns.

Co-ordinates of the locations of the implantations were P 9.5, LR 1.0, H 10.0 mm (under outer surface of the skull) on both sides of periaqueductal gray (PAG). After 1 wk, nociception was assessed by measuring the latency of the escape response (ERL) elicited by strong radiant heat focused on the nose of rabbits. The analgesic effect of morphine (4 mg/kg, iv) was blocked by injecting angiotensin II (AII, 0.1 microgram) into PAG (P less than 0.01, ANOVA), but not by injecting the same dose of AII into the vicinity of PAG (P greater than 0.05, ANOVA). Morphine tolerance was induced by iv infusion of morphine for 2 d, the dose being 50 mg/(kg.8 h) on d 1 and 75 mg/(kg.8 h) on d 2. On d 3, the degree of tolerance was checked by the analgesia induced by iv morphine 4 mg/kg. Tolerance was partly reversed by injecting AII anti-serum 2 microliters into PAG(P less than 0.01, ANOVA).

Four groups were studied: Group 1 received the operation and DMH, Group 2 received the operation alone, Group 3 received DMH alone and Group 4 (controls) received only a sham operation. For Groups 1 and 2, about 8-mm diameter segments of colorectal tissue obtained from various sites in the large intestine of 8-week-old male F344 rats were isologously implanted into the fundic region of the stomachs of age-matched rats. DMH was injected at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight i.m. per week for 20 weeks beginning 4 weeks after the operation. The animals were then observed for 8 months after the initial DMH treatment. In Group 1, adenocarcinomas developed in 41 of 60 successful implants (68%). Furthermore, poorly differentiated type tumors were observed in the grafts obtained from the rectum. This finding was contrary to that for intrinsic rectal tumors, all of which were well differentiated. The histochemical staining of mucin in the tissues from different sites of the large intestine revealed that sulfomucin, which normally exists essentially only in the intrinsic descending colon or rectum, was present in the grafts from the proximal ascending or ascending colon. No gastric tumors were observed in the control rats, which received either DMH or sham operations alone. Tumors in the intrinsic large intestine were observed only in rats that received DMH.

It is characterized by the formation of membranes extending along both surfaces of the detached retina and within the vitreous, but the nature of the growing cells has not yet been determined. Using cytologic and immunocytologic procedures with 13 different monoclonal antibodies directed against Class II histocompatibility antigens and various markers of epithelial and immunocompetent cells, 30 specimens were studied of vitreous or subretinal fluid removed from patients with PVR. Five main types of cells could be identified: heavily pigmented cells, poorly pigmented ones, large totally unpigmented macrophage-resembling ones, smaller unpigmented cells, and lymphocytes. Analysis of intravitreal pigment granules, using autofluorescence by epiillumination and cytologic procedures, showed two different populations of pigmented cells: one with autofluorescent lipofuscin granules and the other with exclusively melanin pigment. Immunostaining procedures confirmed the epithelial nonmacrophage lineage of the intravitreal and subretinal cells because most of these cells were positive for cytokeratin but negative for macrophage markers. In addition, 40-100% of these epithelial-derived cells strongly expressed Class II histocompatibility antigens HLA-DR and -DQ. Lymphocytes were found in 13 specimens; B-cells were seen, but no T-lymphocytes could be identified. These results confirm the involvement of retinal pigment epithelial cells and the strong morphologic changes they undergo during the course of PVR. Moreover, the expression of Class II histocompatibility antigens by the growing cells may be related to inflammatory phenomena, but their eventual role in the development and the extension of periretinal proliferation has not been determined. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In Experiment 1, four groups of subjects made magnitude estimations of triangles ranging in area from 1.5 to 3,072 cm2. No standard or modulus was used, and instructions were similar to those used in absolute magnitude estimation experiments. Each group first judged a different subrange of the stimuli (1.5-24; 48-768; 6-96; or 192-3,072 cm2) before making judgments of the remaining stimuli. In Experiment 2, two groups of subjects made magnitude estimations of triangles ranging in area from 1.5 to 12,288 cm2, with each group first judging a different subrange of stimuli (1.5-24 cm2 or 768-12,288 cm2). The design and instructions were virtually identical to those used in absolute magnitude estimation experiments. Our results indicate that the wording of the instructions is not crucial and that judgments are influenced in two ways that are not predicted by proponents of absolute magnitude estimation. First, the power functions fit to the initially presented subranges (e.g., 1.5-24 cm2), which were judged without contextual effects produced by previously presented stimuli, were inconsistent with one another. Second, judgments of the remaining stimuli were influenced by the subrange of stimuli judged initially. The prevalence of context effects in both experiments, in spite of instructional differences, suggests that although one should avoid using a standard and modulus, there is little else to be gained by adopting the absolute magnitude estimation procedure. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A 67-year-old women complaining of swelling of the anterior neck exhibited thin scalp hair, edematous face and a giant, hard, nodular goiter. Laboratory examination showed elevated levels of ESR, collagenous reaction, gammaglobulin, and a M-bow of the IgG-k type in immunoelectrophoresis. No Bence-Jones protein was found in the urine. Thyroid function test revealed a subclinically hypothyroid state, showing a T3 of 1.32 ng/ml, a T4 of 10.0 micrograms/dl, a TSH of 23.4 microU/ml and positive thyroid antibodies. The scintigram and the CT scan of the thyroid showed deviation of the trachea by the thyroid tumor and calcification within homogeneous thyroid gland.

The histological examination of the removed thyroid weighing 117gr revealed a proliferation of plasma cells and lymphocytes and small amounts of atrophied thyroid follicles. The immunohistological examination of the removed thyroid showed the monoclonality to IgG-k chain. Plasma cells were stainable with methylgreenpyronine. Twenty-six months after thyroidectomy, she died due to progressive emaciation, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and ascites.

The present study compared speech and language comprehension and production between 249 very-low-birthweight (VLBW: less than 1.5 kg) and 363 normal-birthweight 8-year-olds, randomly sampled in a geographic area. Mean performance for the entire group of VLBW children and for the group when 24 VLBW children with major neurologic abnormalities were excluded, was significantly lower than for controls on the majority of speech and language measures. Further analyses addressed the clinical significance of these statistically significant differences. Test scores were converted to standard scores and grouped according to standard deviation intervals, thus portraying each child's performance in terms of the magnitude of discrepancy from each test's mean. When the 24 children with major neurological abnormalities were excluded, no significant differences between the VLBW and control children were observed. Using discrepancy between WISC-R performance IQ and language to define specific language impairment (SLI), a higher percentage of control than VLBW children were identified as having SLI. Neonatal risk factors did not differentiate between VLBW children with or without SLI. A higher proportion of VLBW than control children did present subnormal language associated with IQ less than 85, hearing deficits, and/or major neurological impairments. Thus, SLI is not more common among VLBW than control children. Language deficits accompanied by more general developmental problems, however, are more frequent. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Each target compound was obtained in five steps starting from cyclopent-2-enone. (+)- and (-)-8 were obtained in greater than 98% optical purity through three recrystallizations from ethanol of the (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-mandelate salts of intermediate (+-)-cis-2-phenyl-2-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexylamine ([(+/-)-16]. Crystallization of the (R)-(-)-mandelate salt afforded (1R,2R,5S)-(-)-16, whereas the (S)-(+)-mandelate salt afforded (1S,2S,5R)-(+)-16; the absolute configuration was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis of (-)-16.(R)-(-)-mandelate. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of (+/-)-9-picrate confirmed its trans configuration and provided conformational data. (+)- and (-)-8 and (+/-)-9 were examined for their ability to interact with PCP and sigma binding sites in vitro using [3H]TCP and [3H]pentazocine as radioligands. The binding was compared with that of PCP and contrasted with the rigid symmetrical phencyclidine derivatives cis- and trans-1-[3-phenyl-3-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl]piperidines (6 and 7). The results of the study indicated that the conformations of PCP represented by 6-9 are not optimal for potent interaction at either of these sites. Affinities ranged from 582 nM [(+/-)-9] to 29,000 nM [(+)-8] at PCP binding sites and from 1130 nM [(-)-8] to 16,300 nM (7) at sigma sites. In this assay, PCP exhibited affinities of 64.5 nM at PCP and 1090 nM at sigma sites. Qualitative correlation between the sigma and PCP binding data suggests some similarities between these binding sites. An axial phenyl and equatorial piperidine ring with the nitrogen lone pair of electrons antiperiplanar to the phenyl ring has been postulated as the receptor-active conformation of PCP-like ligands at the PCP binding site. Comparison of the binding data of 7-9 with that of the previously described methylcyclohexyl-PCP derivatives allowed its rationalization in terms of this model. It is likely that the lowered affinity in this bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane series is a consequence of nonoptimal geometry (pseudoequatorial phenyl or pseudoboat) for binding as opposed to the presence of steric bulk which proved deleterious in the methylcyclohexyl-PCP derivatives. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Accelerated Ca2+ fluxes are associated with inhibiting collagen synthesis selectively in human fibroblasts (Flaherty, M., and Chojkier, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12060-12065). In suspension cultures of isolated hepatocytes, the Ca2+ agonist vasopressin increases cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ (Thomas, A.P., Marks, J.S., Coll, K.E., and Williamson, J. R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5716-5725). However, whether vasopressin's interactions with plasma membrane V1 receptors attenuate hepatic collagen production is unknown. We investigated this problem by studying vasopressin's effects on collagen synthesis and Ca2+ efflux in long-term primary cultures of differentiated and proliferation-competent adult rat hepatocytes. Twelve-day-old quiescent cultures were exposed to test substances and labeled with [5-3H]proline. Determinations of radioactivity in collagenase-sensitive and collagenase-resistant proteins were used to calculate the relative levels of collagen production. Synthetic [8-arg]vasopressin stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux within 1 min and inhibited hepatocyte collagen production within 3 h by 50%; overall rates of protein synthesis were not affected significantly. In cultures labeled with [35S]methionine, vasopressin also decreased the levels of newly synthesized and secreted albumin, but not fibrinogen, detected in specific immunoprecipitates analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Northern blot analyses using specific [32P]cDNA probes revealed 70% decreases in hybridizable levels of collagen alpha 1(I) mRNA in hepatocyte cultures treated with either vasopressin or Ca2+ ionophore A23187; hybridizable levels of albumin mRNA also fell approximately 50% following vasopressin treatment. Vasopressin did not affect collagen production in quiescent cultures of mouse Swiss 3T3, human myofibroblast or rat smooth muscle cells; and hepatocyte collagen production was unaffected by treatment with glucagon or dibutyryl cAMP. Thus, accelerated Ca2+ fluxes induced by vasopressin are associated with decreased production of hepatocyte collagen and albumin in primary cultures that simulate quiescent adult rat liver. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

We demonstrated the usefulness and limitations of \"Air Enema\", which is one of preparations for hollow viscera in pelvic CT examination. From Oct. 1986 to Mar. 1987, 38 patients with gynecological abnormalities were evaluated by consecutive pre and post \"Air Enema\" CT. The patients aged 26-75 years with mean of 44.6 years. All patients were examined in prone position with 100 ml of 2% iopamidol in the urinary bladder and medical tampon in the vagina. Two consecutive scans were performed from the level of pubic symphysis to the 5th lumbar vertebra at 10 mm-15 mm intervals. The first scan was pre \"Air Enema\" CT, in which the rectum, entire colon and terminal ileum were not distended. The second scan was post \"Air Enema\" CT, in which the hollow viscera was distended by 1000 ml-1500 ml of air. Two images, each from pre and post \"Air Enema\" CT were evaluated on the efficacy for imaging diagnosis. In \"Air Enema\" CT, main useful effect was \"replacement effect\", which was that intrapelvic masses and/or intrapelvic paravascular spaces were clearly delineated by distended bowels. Detection and location of intrapelvic masses were correctly diagnosed when the masses were relatively small (5.3 cm in average diameter), but there were no advantages in cases in which the pelvic masses were large enough to occupy the pelvic cavity (12.7 cm in average diameter). Abdominal pain was the most common adverse reaction to this technique. But complaints usually disappeared in few hours after examination. Thus, \"Air Enema\" seems to be useful preparation for pelvic CT examination to detect relatively small intrapelvic masses and abnormalities. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Generally, as rumen escape of starch increases, postruminal starch digestion increases, and there does not appear to be a limitation to intestinal starch digestion. However, the efficiency with which postruminal starch is digested decreases, which represents a limitation that warrants investigation. Even though digestible dietary starch is presented to the intestine, there is no net glucose absorption at the portal vein, and plasma glucose levels remain relatively unaffected. This result may be associated with the large metabolic requirement for postruminally absorbed glucose, which is preferentially used for oxidative metabolism at the visceral tissue level. In addition, peripheral glucose concentration is highly regulated. A possible implication is that the exogenous glucose supply may spare endogenously synthesized glucose for gut metabolism, allowing more to be directed to the mammary gland. Amino acids also may be spared (less metabolism of dietary and tissue amino acids in the gut). Current production studies yield no clear evidence as to the benefits of postruminal digestion of starch to enhance milk yield or to change its composition. However, studies suggest that starch digested postruminally is used more efficiently for milk synthesis than that digested in the rumen. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The studies discussed include those that examined reproductive function in the male following perinatal exposure to reproductive toxicants and others in which the compounds were administered to young-adult males, often with very diverse results. For example, some chemicals that alter sex differentiation reduce fertility by affecting breeding performance alone (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), fenarimol, or losulazine), without altering sperm and testicular measures. Others also markedly alter sex differentiation of the genitalia, the accessory glands and the testis in addition to their effects on central nervous system (CNS) sex differentiation and mating behavior (testosterone, flutamide, cyproterone acetate, tamoxifen, estradiol and diethylstilbestrol (DES)). In contrast, prenatal exposure to compounds that alter primary germ cell survival (busulphan, congo red) induce partial gonadal/germ cell agenesis without altering sex differentiation. These chemicals dramatically reduce testicular sperm production in the male offspring, and the most severely affected males are infertile. In a series of studies conducted in our laboratory, young male rats were exposed to known reproductive toxicants in a dose related manner from puberty, through young adulthood and breeding. We have found that the profile of effects varies considerably depending upon the chemical's mechanism of toxicity. When a compound produced infertility through direct effects of testicular function (Carbendazim (MBC) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP)), then testis weight, testicular histology, and testicular sperm head counts provided sensitive indicators of toxicity. In general, dramatic reductions in sperm production are required to induce infertility and these changes were accompanied by elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and changes in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone synthesis. Chemicals that have hormonal activity, alter the internal endocrine environment, or directly effect CNS function induce a completely different profile of effects. For example, estrogen administration alters the function of the seminal vesicle and the endocrine system, and reduces epididymal sperm reserves; while testicular measures are relatively unaffected. Since very different spectrums of effects are produced by different compounds, no single endpoint will consistently be the most sensitive indicator of reproductive toxicity.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Of the 18 cytokines tested we found a considerable overlap in the expression of cytokines by human thymocytes and by thymic stromal cells; both cell types express the mRNA for interleukin-1 beta(IL-1, IL-6, IL-7 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). However, there are substantial differences in the levels of cytokine mRNA expressed in these two types of cells as revealed by the quantitative PCR assay. Stromal cells express considerably higher levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 than thymocytes (14- and 27-fold respectively). In addition, a number of cytokines such as lymphotoxin and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), are expressed exclusively in thymocytes whereas others such as stem cell factor (SCF), IL-1 receptor antagonist-2 (IRAP-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are produced only in stromal cells. There is a complete overlap in the expression of a group of cytokine receptors tested in thymocytes and thymic stromal cells; these include IL-1R, IL-2R, IL-6R, IL-7R, TNFR and stem cell growth factor receptor (c-KIT). The expression of specific cytokines by thymic stromal cells and the parallel expression of their receptors on thymocytes under physiological conditions, support the hypothesis that these cytokines participate in paracrine interactions between these two cell populations during thymocyte differentiation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The non-steroidal triphenylethylene toremifene is well tolerated clinically and can sensitize multidrug resistant cells to the effects of doxorubicin in vitro. The chemosensitizing properties of toremifene in estrogen receptor negative, multidrug resistant MDA-A1 human breast cancer cells were studied using flow cytometric analysis. Cell cycle kinetics of MDA-A1 cells were not significantly affected by treatment with either toremifene or doxorubicin alone, as the majority of cells remained in G0/G1. However, preincubation with toremifene for 70 hours followed by treatment with doxorubicin caused a marked shift of cells to G2, as cells appeared to be blocked in that phase of the cell cycle. This result was nearly identical to the effect of doxorubicin alone on doxorubicin-sensitive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and can be interpreted as a \"resensitization\" by toremifene of MDA-A1 cells to doxorubicin. This chemosensitizing effect of toremifene was accompanied by an enhanced accumulation of doxorubicin in MDA-A1 cells (+110% after 70 hours pre-incubation with toremifene), and by a depression in protein kinase C activity in MDA-A1 cells that was maximal following 70 hours incubation with toremifene. Flow cytometry is a widely available technique that might be applied clinically to monitor at the cellular level the chemosensitizing effects of toremifene and other modulators of multidrug resistance. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Since both systems are accessory cell (AC)-dependent, an understanding of the role of AC in anti-CD3-induced proliferation may provide an understanding of physiological activation via the T cell receptor. Previous work has implicated receptor crosslinking as an important AC function. To determine its necessity in anti-CD3-induced lymphocyte proliferation, we prepared highly purified T lymphocytes and found that these cells did not respond to the anti-CD3 mAb UCHT1, either alone or with interleukin 1 (IL1), interleukin 2 (IL2), or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA). However, the response, as measured by appearance of IL2 receptors and proliferation, was restored by crosslinking with immobilized goat anti-mouse antibodies (GAM) and did not require the addition of IL1, IL2, or TPA. Thus, crosslinking of CD3 receptors was a sufficient signal for proliferation of these cells. Cyclosporine A (CsA) inhibited the activation induced by immobilized UCHT1. Since macrophages are the principle targets of CsA-mediated suppression of mitogen-induced proliferation, but macrophages do not participate in the response to immobilized anti-CD3, this may indicate that CsA was inhibiting crosslinking or a signal generated by it. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The carbanion of the adduct of L-tryptophan to pyridoxal phosphate accumulated during the steady state of the catalyzed reaction. Moreover, it was formed transiently and without a lag in single turnovers, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was released only after formation of the carbanion. These and further data prove first that the affinity for indoleglycerol phosphate and its cleavage to indole in the alpha subunit are enhanced substantially by aminoacrylate bound to the beta subunit. This indirect activation explains why the turnover number of the physiological reaction is larger than that of the indoleglycerol phosphate cleavage reaction. Second, reprotonation of nascent tryptophan carbanion is rate limiting for overall tryptophan synthesis. Third, most of the indole generated in the active site of the alpha subunit is transferred directly to the active site of the beta subunit and only insignificant amounts pass through the solvent. Comparison of the single turnover rate constants with the known elementary rate constants of the partial reactions catalyzed by the alpha and beta active sites suggests that the cleavage reaction rather than the transfer of indole or its condensation with aminoacrylate is rate limiting for the formation of nascent tryptophan. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The antibody, raised in mice immunized with nonenzymatically glycated albumin isolated from human plasma, recognizes glycated epitopes residing in albumin but not in other plasma proteins, and does not react with unglycated albumin. We now report utilization of this antibody to measure the amount of nonenzymatically glycated albumin in human plasma. When immobilized onto microtiter wells in ELISA format, A717 yields a linear dose-response relationship upon incubation with authentic purified glycoalbumin. This allows construction of standard curves from which the amount of circulating glycoalbumin can be determined. The glycoalbumin level (mean +/- SEM) in 12 samples from nondiabetic subjects was 2.4 +/- 0.22% of total albumin. In normal plasma spiked with known amounts of purified glycoalbumin, values measured with this assay were close to 100% of expected values. Glycoalbumin levels in samples from 25 diabetic subjects ranged from 1.6 to 11.6%, with a mean +/- SEM of 4.5 +/- 1.2%. Glycoalbumin levels in diabetic samples correlated significantly (r = 0.93) with glycohemoglobin values. The ability of this assay to quantitate glycoalbumin, an index of the prevailing blood glucose concentrations over the preceding 2-3 weeks, makes it a favourable candidate for utilization in the clinical setting to monitor glycemic control in diabetic subjects. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cloned receptor molecule is a 66 kDa membrane protein that is structurally related to a large superfamily of haemopoietin/growth factor receptors. The 66 kDa EpoR alone is capable of binding to erythropoietin (Epo) with nanomolar affinity. The native EpoR may form dimers before or after binding Epo. EpoR dimers and/or associated molecules are probably necessary for high-affinity Epo binding. The 66 kDa EpoR probably exists as a protein complex with as yet unidentified proteins of 100 and 85 kDa. The molecular mechanism of Epo signal transduction remains largely undefined. The possible role of the EpoR in human diseases has been studied in a variety of clinical conditions. A structurally abnormal EpoR gene has been identified in a human erythroleukemia cell line. In polycythemia vera, red cell progenitors exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to Epo and express only low-affinity EpoR. Some cases of hereditary polycythemia may be due to a mutant EpoR conferring enhanced Epo sensitivity. Other pathologic conditions may also be associated with abnormalities of the EpoR or its associated molecules. Soluble, immunoreactive EpoR is detectable in human serum, but its physiological significance is unknown. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Torque was measured at a specific knee angle during isokinetic concentric or eccentric actions at nine angular velocities (0.17-3.66 rad/s) and during isometric actions. Activation was by \"maximal\" voluntary effort or by transcutaneous tetanic electrical stimulation that induced an isometric torque equal to 60% (STIM 1) or 45% (STIM 2) of the voluntary isometric value. Torque increased (P less than 0.05) to 1.4 times isometric as the speed of eccentric actions increased to 1.57 rad/s for STIM 1 and STIM 2. Thereafter, increases in eccentric speed did not further increase torque. Torque did not increase (P greater than 0.05) above isometric for voluntary eccentric actions. As the speed of concentric actions increased from 0.00 to 3.66 rad/s, torque decreased (P less than 0.05) more (P less than 0.05) for both STIM 1 and STIM 2 (two-thirds) than for voluntary activation (one-half). As a result of these responses, torque changed three times as much (P less than 0.05) across speeds of concentric and eccentric actions with artificial (3.4-fold) than voluntary (1.1-fold) activation. The results indicate that with artificial activation the normalized speed-torque relationship of the knee extensors in situ is remarkably similar to that of isolated muscle. The relationship for voluntary activation, in contrast, suggests that the ability of the central nervous system to activate the knee extensors during maximal efforts depends on the speed and type of muscle action performed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The movement of the microspheres towards the larynx is visualized and recorded using a scintallation camera (Picker Dyna Camera) with a large field of view (30 cm in diameter) for 30 to 60 minutes, depending upon the time required for the spheres to reach the top of the trachea. Polaroid pictures are made immediately and every minute thereafter until the activity reaches the larynx. The data are also recorded and stored on magnetic tape for subsequent analyses by computer.

Phenol-sodium dodecyl sulfate-extracted LAC virion RNA was not infectious for BHK-21 cell cultures under conditions in which Sindbis viral RNA was infectious. Treatment of LAC virus with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and salt released three nucleocapsid structures, each containing one species of virion RNA. The nucleocapsids had sedimenation coefficients of 115S, 90S, and 65S. Negative-contrast electron microscopy of the nucleocapsids indicated that they were convoluted, supercoiled, and apparently circular.

After periodate oxidation, each virion RNA species was labeled by reduction with [3H]sodium borohydride.

Serum DBH activity in blood from newborn animals was 90 units, approximately 4.5 times higher than in blood from 60- to 90-day-old rats. The serum enzyme activity increased to 130 units at 15 days of age and then decreased rapidly to adult levels (20 units). This decrease was not due to changes in levels of circulating inhibitors or activators of the enzyme. Four different inbred strains of rats also demonstrated a striking decrease in serum DBH activity between 15 and 60 days of age. Cardiac DBH in Sprague-Dawley rats increased approximately 5-fold from birth to 15 days of age, but failed to decrease thereafter. Salivary gland DBH activity also increased with maturation and failed to decrease. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine were no different in blood samples obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats 15 and 60 days of age. This finding makes it less likely that the decrease in serum DBH activity with maturation represents a decrease in the functional activity of sympathetic nerve terminals. Antibodies against DBH were used to measure immunoreactive DBH protein in serum from rats 15 and 60 days of age. These studies demonstrated a significantly higher enzymatic activity per unit of immunoreactive protein in blood from young rats than in blood from animals 60 days of age. The ratios of enzymatic activity to immunoreactive protein as measured by the quantity of antibody necessary to precipitate 50% of the endogenous serum DBH activity (AD50) were 21.18 +/- 1.04 and 3.83 +/- 0.40 (mean +/- S.E.M.) for blood from animals 15 and 60 days of age, respectively. Among the possible explanations for this observation are included a greater quantity of enzymatically inactive but immunoreactive DBH in blood of adult animals as compared with the blood of young rats, or the existence of a different form of serum DBH in blood of young animals. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

When Proteus mirabilis Pm17 harboring pTW2 was grown in broth at 30 degrees C, a considerable number of R- segregants (approximately 40%) were consistently observed. This indicates that pTW2 is unstable even at the permissive temperature for the replication of Rts1. The pTW2+ cells in a culture were heterogeneous with respect to the level of kanamycin resistance, ranging from 500 to 4,000 mug of the drug per ml. The amount of pTW2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) relative to the Pm17 chromosomal DNA was about fivefold as large as that of Rts1 DNA in an exponentially growing culture. In addition, pTW2 in P. mirabilis continued to replicate after the chromosome had ceased to replicate, which was shown in the study of the inhibition of protein synthesis. Contrary to pTW2, the parent plasmid Rts1 is highly stable, and the relative percent Rts1 DNA is maintained at approximately 7% in any cultural conditions at a permissive temperature. These results suggest that copies of pTW2 may not segregate evenly into the host progeny upon cell division and that the replication of pTW2 does not coordinate with that of the chromosome. A remarkable instability of pTW2 as well as an increase in the relative percent pTW2 DNA was also shown when E. coli were used as the host cells. These results suggest the possibility that there is a gene or a gene cluster on the Rst1 genome responsible for the control of both replication and segregation of Rts1. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Spinal cord and cortical neurons demonstrated sustained repetitive firing (SRF) of action potentials (APs) at high frequency in response to depolarizing current pulses. Hippocampal neurons fired rapidly only in the pressure of the calcium channel blocker verapamil (1 microM). Concentrations of CBZ equivalent to therapeutic anticonvulsant levels in cerebrospinal fluid (greater than 4.2 microM) limited firing to a few action potentials in all three cell types in parallel with use-dependent reduction of AP maximal rate of rise (Vmax). Resting membrane properties and postsynaptic responses to ionophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate were unaffected. The CBZ metabolite, 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, limited SRF at a concentration (4 microM) encountered at therapeutic CBZ levels. Another major CBZ metabolite, the 10,11-diol, limited SRF only at concentrations greater than those encountered with therapeutic serum CBZ levels. In control medium, APs could be evoked at a maximal rate of 450 Hz while in CBZ (10.6 microM) AP frequency was limited to 100 to 200 Hz. Limitation of SRF was voltage-dependent and could be partially reversed, or prevented, by membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, recovery of Vmax of sodium-dependent action potentials from inactivation was slowed, suggesting an effect on voltage-dependent sodium channels. CBZ and phenytoin effects of SRF were similar. We suggest that limitation of sustained high frequency repetitive firing may be a significant anticonvulsant action of carbamazepine. The 10,11-epoxy derivative of CBZ, but not the 10,11-diol, may contribute to anticonvulsant efficacy by the same mechanism. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The ratio of the three isozymes obtained from a heterodimer follows the binomial distribution of 1:2:1, indicating random reassociation of the two subunits. The physical and enzymatic properties of the reassociated isozymes are the same as those obtained directly from human liver preparations. The nature of subunit-subunit interactions of human ADH class I isozymes is examined by optimizing the conditions required for the formation of the new dimers \"in vitro\". The effect of a number of reagents previously used in the reversible dissociation of dehydrogenases is investigated. The coenzyme NAD+ is a potent inhibitor of the dissociation of dimers during the freeze/thaw procedure. The presence of sodium phosphate in the enzyme solution is essential during the freezing and thawing experiment. No appreciable dissociation/reassociation occurs in TES, HEPES, or even potassium phosphate. The reversible dissociation is due primarily to the decrease in pH because of the low solubility of Na2HPO4 at low temperatures. The reassociation occurs after thawing in a temperature-dependent process. There is no reactivation if the enzyme is incubated at 0 degrees C after thawing, while at 25 degrees C high recovery in activity is achieved in a time period ranging from 15 to 90 min.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Early and late mortality rates in rheumatic patients were 41 and 23 percent, respectively (36 percent being alive after a mean of 5.6 years), compared to 33 and 11 percent, respectively, in the nonrheumatic patients (56 percent being alive after a mean of 2 years). Of all survivors, 88 percent were functionally improved. Among the rheumatic patients: (1) 88 percent had organic tricuspid disease; (2) of the 39 patients with tricuspid insufficiency who underwent corrective mitral surgery 7 years before TVR, the tricuspid insufficiency had progressed over the 7 years; (3) the number of patients with tricuspid insufficiency had increased (39 versus 59) over the same 7 year period; (4) a high early mortality rate was encountered in those who were preoperatively in New York Heart Association (N.Y.H.A.) Class IV, or who had cardiomegaly, or pulmonary hypertension, or poor ventricular function, or organic disease, or reoperation; (5) the percentages of survivors with different prostheses were: Starr-Edwards, 31 percent; Beall-Surgitool, 14 percent; Kay-Shiley, 46 percent, BjÃ¶rk-Shiley, 50 percent; Lillehei-Kaster, 100 percent; Cutter-Smeloff and Wada-Cutter, nil. Among the nonrheumatic patients, two with the Cutter-Smeloff, two with the Beall-Surgitool, and one with the Lillehei-Kaster were alive after 14, 37, and 15 months, respectively. Among all survivors of TVR, late thrombus and pannus developed on both ball and disc prostheses (Starr-Edwards, two; Cutter-Smeloff, one; Lillehei-Kaster, one). These findings suggest that TVR should be performed earlier in rheumatic patients to reduce the operative mortality rate and that the Lillehei-Kaster prosthesis is probably most suitable for TVR. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The composition of the perfusate and bath varied from normal, physiological fluids to fluids deficient in a single solute. The deletion of glucose from the perfusate increased the lumen-to-bath flux of phosphate from 5.51 +/- 1.15 to 8.32 +/- 1.34 pmol/mm-min (P less than 0.01). Similar changes occurred when glucose transport was inhibited by phlorizin 10 micron in the perfusate, The deletion of alanine from the perfusate increased the lumen-to-bath flux of phosphate from 6.55 +/- 1.08 to 9.00 +/- 1.30 pmol/mm-min (P less than 0.01) but did not affect glucose transport significantly, 80.1 +/- 10.1 vs. 72.5 +/- 5.4 pmol/mm-min. Replacement of intraluminal sodium with choline, elimination of potassium from the bath, and removal of bicarbonate from the lumen and bath each reduced glucose, phosphate, and fluid absorption. These data indicate that the proximal absorptive processes for glucose and for phosphate include elements that are dependent upon some function of sodium transport. Additionally, the effects on phosphate transport of deleting glucose or alanine occur independent of any changes in net sodium transport and are opposite the effects of deleting bicarbonate. These differences may relate to the observations that the transport of glucose and alanine is electrogenic while that of bicarbonate is not. Regardless of possible mechanisms, the data demonstrate that important changes in the absorption rates of different solutes handled significantly by the proximal convoluted tubule may occur in response to changes in specific components of proximal sodium transport. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Beet pulp replaced portions of dietary cornstarch. Digestibilities of DM and OM decreased by an average of 6% when comparing diets containing BP to the control diet, and quadratic and cubic responses were noted in digestibilities of fiber constituents (lower values at the 7.5 and 10.0% levels, higher values at the 2.5, 5.0 and 12.5% levels). Digestible energy (DE) and ME intakes (kcal/d) were not affected by treatment, but when expressed as a percentage of GE, values decreased (4.8% for DE; 6.2% for ME) linearly with increasing BP levels. Wet weight of feces increased (from 117 to 374 g/d) linearly as percentage of dietary BP increased. Frequency of defecation was higher (P less than .05) for dogs fed the diet containing 12.5% BP than for dogs fed the other diets (5.2 vs mean value of 2.8/24 h). Mean retention time of marked fiber decreased linearly (high value of 23.4 h for the 2.5% BP treatment, low value of 13.0 h for the 10.0% BP treatment) with increased level of BP. Beet pulp levels up to 7.5% of diet DM appear acceptable as a dietary fiber source in a meat-based canine diet. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The inducing element of RPMI 8226 has not been defined but evidence suggests that a member of the GroEL heat shock protein (HSP) family (HSP 58) may have a role in the induction by Daudi cells. The present study examined the reactivity patterns of gamma delta T-cell clones generated in response to RPMI 8226 and addressed the possible role of HSP 58 in this process. RPMI 8226 induced a population of V gamma 9 TCR+ cells which were heterogeneous in terms of their cell surface markers, patterns of proliferation and cytotoxic responses. All clones expressed CD3, CD2, CD18 and CD29. They demonstrated variability in expression of CD56, CD8 and HLA-DR. RPMI 8226 stimulated proliferation in purified bulk gamma delta cultures and clones. Daudi was also capable of inducing these cells to proliferate while mycobacterial products were not effective. The clones demonstrated a limited non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity pattern with some evidence of clonal heterogeneity. Although both Daudi and RPMI 8226 were sensitive to lysis by the clones, cold inhibition experiments indicated differential activity towards these targets. Anti-HSP 58 was inhibitory to gamma delta T-cell induction by RPMI 8226, Daudi and mycobacterial products. However, the anti-HSP 58 antibody appears to bind to the surface of at least six different tumour cell lines with no correlation to their ability to induce gamma delta T cells and the anti-HSP 58 inhibited non-gamma delta responses. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The following additional properties suggest that these antibodies are specific for huIFN-gamma receptors: they bind to the surface of human cells expressing IFN-gamma receptors but not to heterologous cells; this binding is inhibited competitively by addition of rhuIFN-gamma; the number of binding sites revealed by direct binding of 125I-labeled rhuIFN-gamma correlates with the amount of antigen recognized by the mAbs on different cell lines. A Triton X-100 extract of a membrane-enriched fraction of human Raji cells was affinity purified with these mAbs and the eluates from such columns were further purified on immobilized rhuIFN-gamma. As revealed by SDS-PAGE, the final eluate contained two major protein bands with approximate Mr of 90,000 (p90) and 50,000 (p50), respectively. Both proteins were able to specifically bind 125I-labeled rhuIFN-gamma upon electroblotting to nitrocellulose. This binding could be inhibited by the huIFN-gamma receptor mAbs, suggesting that the same epitopes are recognized on p90, p50, and on the cell surface. Therefore, these proteins most likely represent at least a part of huIFN-gamma receptors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A chain oxidation of PUFA is initiated by hydrogen abstraction from allylic or bis-allylic positions leading to oxygenation and subsequent formation of peroxyl radicals. In media of low hydrogen-donating capacity the peroxyl radical is free to react further by competitive pathways resulting in cyclic peroxides, double bond isomerization and formation of dimers and oligomers. In the presence of good hydrogen donators, such as alpha-tocopherol or PUFA themselves, the peroxyl radical abstracts hydrogen to furnish PUFA hydroperoxides. Given the proper conditions or catalysts, the hydroperoxides are prone to further transformations by free radical routes. Homolytic cleavage of the hydroperoxy group can afford either a peroxyl radical or an alkoxyl radical. The products of peroxyl radicals are identical to those obtained during autoxidation of PUFA; that is, it makes no difference whether the peroxyl radical is generated in the process of autoxidation or from a performed hydroperoxide. Of particular interest is the intramolecular rearrangement of peroxyl radicals to furnish cyclic peroxides and prostaglandin-like bicyclo endoperoxides. Other principal peroxyl radical reactions are the beta-scission of O2, intermolecular addition and self-combination. Alkoxyl radicals of PUFA, contrary to popular belief, do not significantly abstract hydrogens, but rather are channeled into epoxide formation through intramolecular rearrangement. Other significant reactions of PUFA alkoxyl radicals are beta-scission of the fatty chain and possibly the formation of ether-linked dimers and oligomers. Although homolytic reactions of PUFA hydroperoxides have received the most attention, hydroperoxides are also susceptible to heterolytic transformations, such as nucleophilic displacement and acid-catalyzed rearrangement. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The studies used normal, retinol-deficient, and retinol-repleted retinol-deficient rats with or without colchicine pretreatment. Affinity-purified monomeric Fab' fragments from the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-rat RBP were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. This conjugate effectively penetrated into tissue sections and enabled RBP to be localized by high resolution immunoelectron microscopy. In the normal liver parenchymal cell, RBP was found to be localized in the synthetic and secretory structures including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex (GC), and secretory vesicles. With the method used, significant localization of RBP was not observed in hepatic cells other than parenchymal cells. The distribution of RBP-positive areas within parenchymal cells changed markedly with retinol depletion. Thus, a heavy accumulation of RBP in the ER, accompanied by a marked decrease of the RBP-positive GC and secretory vesicles, was demonstrated in liver parenchymal cells from retinol-deficient rats. After repletion of deficient rats with retinol, the RBP that accumulated in the ER appeared to move rapidly from the ER through GC and secretory vesicles to the cell surface. Pretreatment with colchicine led to marked increase in RBP-positive secretory vesicles in retinol-repleted rat liver parenchymal cells. The results reported here demonstrate that the specific block in hepatic RBP secretion seen in retinol deficiency involves an inhibition of the movement of RBP from the ER to the GC in the parenchymal cell. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The clinical setting is always the same in this condition: the infant exhibits no clinical anomalies during the symptom-free interval between birth and the volvulus (4 h to 35 d, m = 7 d in our series). Onset is extremely sudden, with a complete, proximal obstruction, early and abundant passage of blood per rectum, and above all a severe shock that fails to respond to resuscitation. Roentgenograms contribute little to the diagnosis and surgery should never be delayed to perform complementary investigations of any kind. Indeed, the only effective treatment is unwinding the volvulus within the first six hours following onset, for beyond that time irreversible necrosis of the entire small bowel and occasionally colon occurs. Five infants died because they were seen too late and operated on 36 hours on average after the onset of symptoms. The two survivors had an early operation that prevented total necrosis of the small bowel. However, this pattern seems to vary according to the degree of cecum anchorage: a fixed cecum results in a very tight volvulus with complete, early ischemia and usually irreversible necrosis of the small bowel beyond the sixth hour (9/9 published cases); an even slightly mobile cecum results in a looser volvulus, with less severe ischemia, more delayed necrosis, and a possibility of complete recovery (5/6 published cases).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A new apparatus to measure the attenuated ultrasound within the tissue was devised by using a pulse reflection method. After the measurement in vivo, the same examination was performed in a specimen of the removed tumor in vitro after surgery. Correlation between the characteristic of attenuation of ultrasound within the tissue in vivo and in vitro was investigated. The results in malignant parotid tumors were compared with ones in benign tumors of the parotid gland, too. The measurement of attenuation of ultrasound within a tumor in vivo was also compared with regard to the posterior echoes in ultrasound imaging, and then pathohistological study of the tumor was carried out in each case. The results of this study were summarized as follows: 1) Characteristics of ultrasound-attenuation within tumors in vivo were well correlated with ones in vitro. 2) Attenuation of ultrasound in malignant tumors tended to be stronger than that in benign ones. 3) Values of ultrasound-attenuation within tissues in vivo were also affected by the contents of collagen in them, which was reported in my previous study on tissues in vitro. 4) Posterior echoes in ultrasound imagings were influenced by attenuations of ultrasound in tissues. However, the measurement of attenuation of ultrasound in tumors of the parotid gland is assumed to be helpful to promote the diagnostic value of sonographical examinations, and especially it would be useful for differential diagnosis of malignancies. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A. Charon, T. A. Luger, S. E. Mergenhagen, and J. J. Oppenheim, Infect. Immun. 38:1190-1195, 1982). In the present study, we sought to investigate whether this IL-1-like activity belonged to IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta and to characterize some of the biochemical properties of this factor. Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta (rIL-1 alpha or rIL-1 beta) have been used for serological comparison of the IL-1-like factor. IL-1-like activity was completely neutralized by anti-human rIL-1 alpha antiserum, but not by anti-human rIL-1 beta antiserum. On gel filtration with a high-pressure liquid chromatographic Superose 12 column, IL-1-like activity was separated into two peaks, one with a molecular weight of about 43,000 and the other with a molecular weight of less than 17,000. The majority of the IL-1-like factor with a low molecular weight in human gingival crevicular fluid migrated at a molecular weight of about 17,000 under the reducing conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the IL-1-like factor was further confirmed by an immunochemical method (Western blotting [immunoblotting]) by using anti-human rIL-1 alpha monoclonal antibodies. On isoelectric chromatography with a high-pressure liquid chromatographic Mono P column, the pI of this IL-1-like factor was between pH 4.9 and 5.2. These results suggest that the IL-1-like factor in human gingival crevicular fluid from diseased sites in patients with chronic inflammatory periodontitis consists predominantly of IL-1 alpha. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the 13-week dermal studies, groups of 10 rats of each sex received 0.3 ml of VCHD in acetone at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 200 mg/ml, and mice received 0.1 ml at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 100 mg/ml. Skin lesions were observed at the site of application at the top two dose levels for both species and sexes, and consisted of acanthosis, parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis and sebaceous gland hyperplasia. In mice, follicular atrophy of the ovary, characterized by decreased numbers of primary and secondary follicles, occurred at the 50- and 100-mg dose levels.

The objective of this study was to examine the mechanism of GtH-induced maturational competence in croaker oocytes. Specifically, we determined the in vitro secretion of steroids by intact ovarian follicles of unprimed or hCG-primed fish, the direct effects of steroids on maturational competence, and the effects of steroid (cyanoketone), protein (cycloheximide), and RNA (actinomycin D) synthesis inhibitors on hCG-induced maturational competence and steroidogenesis in vitro. The steroid content of the incubation medium after hCG treatment was measured by RIA. The effects of hCG or exogenous steroid treatment on maturational competence were determined by recording the incidence of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after MIS-induced GVBD in a standard bioassay. Our major findings were: (1) induction of maturational competence occurred after exposure of ovarian follicles to hCG either in vivo or in vitro; (2) MIS secretion was detected in follicles of hCG-primed fish but not unprimed fish, and no MIS secretion was observed during hCG induction of maturational competence in vitro; (3) treatment with cyanoketone blocked the hCG-dependent secretion of testosterone and estradiol but not the development of maturational competence; (4) treatment with MIS or various other exogenous steroids in the absence of hCG did not induce maturational competence; and (5) hCG-induced maturational competence was inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Therefore, the mechanisms of GtH induction of oocyte maturation in Atlantic croaker can be described in two distinct stages: a delta-4 steroid-(including MIS) and estrogen-independent priming stage followed by a MIS-mediated GVBD stage. The priming stage may involve mechanisms requiring RNA as well as protein synthesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Chest X-ray is the current standard method of locating the catheter tip. This is usually not feasible in the operating room setting, particularly after the induction of anesthesia. Intravascular ECG registration using the catheter as a lead and identification of intra-atrial P-waves has been suggested as an alternative. In the present study we evaluated the use of Doppler sonography as a noninvasive method of locating the catheter tip and detecting faulty placement. Two hundred patients scheduled for insertion of a central venous catheter took part in this study. The catheters were inserted via standard routes (internal or external jugular vein, basilar or cephalic vein). A Doppler sonographic device with a 2 mHz probe was used (Parke Electronics 915L). The probe was applied to the right sternal border and affixed at the position where the characteristic venous flow sound was most distinct. The signals were displayed visually, subjected to spectral analysis, and also recorded for later evaluation. A rapid injection of 2-5 ml isotonic saline causes turbulences which can readily be heard and recognized without special training. The position of every catheter was later confirmed by radiography, and in 159 patients the intraatrial ECG method was subjected to direct comparison with the sonographic method. The turbulences due to the injected fluid were found to cause an increased amplitude at frequencies above 350 Hz. If the catheter tip was positioned correctly there was no discernable time lag between the start of the injection and perception of turbulences.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

When using a nonoxygen binding fluid, the therapeutic efficacy of hemodilution-induced increases in CBF are offset by concomitant decreases in oxygen content. The effect of hemodilution, with diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb), on CBF during middle cerebral artery occlusion was assessed. Rats were hemodiluted to one of the following hematocrits (Hct): (a) 44/Hct, (b) 37/Hct, (c) 30/Hct, (d) 23/Hct, (e) 16/Hct, or (f) 9/Hct. After 10 min of ischemia, CBF was determined with 14C-iodoantipyrine. Coronal brain sections were evaluated for areas with a CBF of 0-10 and 11-20 ml 100 g-1 min-1. In addition, oxygen delivery was calculated. In the center of the ischemic zone, both areas of low CBF were less in the 30/Hct, 23/Hct, and 16/Hct groups compared with the 44/Hct and 37/Hct groups; and both areas were less in the 9/Hct group compared with the other five groups (p < 0.05). For the hemisphere contralateral to occlusion, there was a direct correlation between hematocrit and oxygen delivery. However, for the hemisphere ipsilateral to occlusion, oxygen delivery increased as hematocrit decreased (44/Hct, 8.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 9/Hct, 13.6 +/- 0.4 [mean +/- SD, ml 100 g-1 min-1]). The results of this study support a hypothesis that hemodilution with DCLHb decreases the extent of focal cerebral ischemia. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After recovery, it was 66.5 beats per minute. When the temperature rose by 1 degree C, the heart rate increased on the average by 8.5 beats per minute. During the febrile period, the heart rate remained high, even during sleep. The PR interval shortened significantly at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute and occasional first- or second-degree atrioventricular blocks were rarer. The QT interval shortened significantly at heart rates of 60, 80, and 100 beats per minute. Simple and complex ventricular extrasystoles were not increased by fever. In contrast, frequent supraventricular extrasystoles developed in two patients during high fever, but not during the control recording. If an acute febrile infection induces a prolongation of the atrioventricular conduction or the QT interval, or if frequent ventricular extrasystolic beats are triggered, complications must be suspected. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) IgG responses in UK children showed a marked trough between 6 months and 3 years coincident with the reported peak incidence of disseminated tuberculosis. Geometric mean IgG responses to sonicates of slow-growing mycobacteria (rich in LAM) in 36 children with disseminated tuberculosis were markedly lower than in 99 children with localized tuberculous lesions (for Mycobacterium scrofulaceum P < 0.01, for M. tuberculosis P < 0.01, and for M. vaccae P < 0.01). Responses to purified LAM were also lower in the disseminated tuberculosis group (P < 0.05) but there was no difference between the groups in their response to mycobacterial 65 kDa protein. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduced response to sonicated mycobacterial antigens and to LAM in children with disseminated disease was independent of age, nutritional status, skin test reactivity, duration of previous symptoms, and city of origin. There was no evidence for sequestration of antibody to immune complexes. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that children with low levels of antibody to sonicated mycobacterial antigen and to LAM, or those who cannot mount an antibody response, are predisposed to dissemination. A role for antibody in preventing disseminated forms of tuberculosis in childhood has implications for the development of improved vaccines and for the optimum timing of vaccination with bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

They used the effect of oscillations which develop when through fluid (in vivo water) a mixture of air is bubbled and which can be, if the expiration tube is sufficiently rigid, transmitted back into the lungs. If the CPAP circuit is suitably arranged, it can ensure an adequate exchange of blood gases. The authors found marked changes in the amplitude of pressure oscillations as well as of the frequency in relation to the shape of the ending beneath the fluid surface (greatest when a funnel with a 30 mm diameter and 90 degree angle in relation to a normal line projected on the water surface is used). They found that the compliance (C) has no substantial effect on the amplitude nor on the frequency of oscillations. The mentioned bubble system approached as to its efficiency the commercial oscillation ventilator Stephen 3000 SFH and was used in the therapy of respiratory failure in three neonates with body weights of 1250-2700 g. The authors conclude that high frequency oscillation \"bubble\" ventilation is a cheap, safe and highly effective therapy which can be used in any department providing care of neonates even during transport. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After oral administration (10 mg/kg) of a parent drug, e.g. ipsapirone or gepirone, the metabolite appears in significant amounts in plasma, with maximal concentrations of 0.9 and 1.4 nmol/ml respectively. The metabolite half-life ranged from about 140 to 200 min. Ipsapirone is eliminated more slowly than gepirone, with a half-life of about 100 and 30 min, respectively. The metabolite to parent drug ratios for the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were 1 for ipsapirone and 14 for gepirone. PmP (0.5-2 mg/kg p.o), ipsapirone, gepirone and buspirone (5-20 mg/kg p.o.) dose dependently antagonized the slowing of gastrointestinal transit induced by clonidine 0.1 mg/kg s.c. The doses inhibiting the antitransit effect of clonidine by 50% were 0.8 mg/kg for PmP, 14 mg/kg for ipsapirone and 9 mg/kg for both gepirone and buspirone. Analysis of small intestinal longitudinal muscle of rats given the ED50 of PmP, ipsapirone, gepirone, buspirone showed that PmP concentrations in the longitudinal muscle (with attached myenteric plexus) fell within a relatively narrow range and were consistent with the appropriate transit scores. The plasma was also tested for anticlonidine activity. These data indicate that PmP formation is a pharmacologically significant metabolic process for the buspirone-related drugs, ipsapirone and gepirone, and that this metabolite is responsible for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking activity exerted by these drugs in vivo in the rat. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 602, 167-180), we constructed a model of a channels with several conformational states. The origin of these conformational states and the source for the transitions from one to the other are given explicitly for the presented model. In this work the effect of multiple conformational states on the ion transport process is analyzed. We considered a channel protein with two main barriers and one binding site. The site is surrounded by dipolar groups. The dipole moment of these groups can be reoriented by thermal activity and also by electrical interaction with the transported ions. Differently polarized states generate different activation energy barriers for the ions. The set of conformational states of the channel is constituted by all the possible polarized states of the binding site. Using the rate-theory analysis of ion transport (GlÃ¤sstone, S., Laider, K.J. and Eyring, H. (1941) The theory of rate processes, McGraw-Hill, New York), the possible coupling between ion flux and the channel conformational transitions has been incorporated into the model by considering the dependence of the rate constants on the heights of the energy barriers. The resulting multistate kinetic equations have been solved numerically. It was shown that the simple saturation characteristic of the flux-concentration curve was obtained. For certain values of the model parameters, the channel shows a strongly different conductance for anions compared to cations. In fact, the model contains an interesting mechanism that exhibits selectivity with respect to the charge of the ions. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

To identify this endothelial GATA-binding protein, a human endothelial cell cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes for a portion of the zinc finger domain of GATA-1. A 2.6-kilobase cDNA encoding a 470 amino acid protein was obtained. Sequence analysis revealed a predicted protein which is the human counterpart of a related chicken protein, designated GATA-2. Human GATA-2 is expressed by a variety of cells, including erythroid, HeLa, and endothelial cells. A complex of a GATA-containing probe and recombinant GATA-2 expressed in COS cells comigrates with that present in gel shift experiments with nuclear extract derived from endothelial cells. In addition, expressed human GATA-2 protein transactivates reporter gene constructs containing either minimal GATA promoter elements or the native PPET-1 promoter in a cotransfection assay. Retinoic acid treatment of endothelial cells results in down-regulation of GATA-2 expression as well as down-regulation of PPET-1 gene expression. Human homologs of other known GATA-binding transcription factors are either absent from endothelial cells (in the case of GATA-1) or made in small quantities and not significantly affected by retinoid acid in these cells (in the case of GATA-3), making it unlikely that they regulate the PPET-1 gene. We propose that GATA-2 is the GATA-binding protein required for PPET-1 gene expression in endothelial cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We hypothesize that nephrotoxic drugs used in prior chemotherapy can precipitate renal radiation damage. Studies were designed to determine if nephrotoxic antineoplastic drugs could shorten the latent period for the development of radiation nephritis. Rats were given bilateral renal irradiation using a radiation schedule that produced moderate nephritis. Cisplatinum, BCNU, or mitomycin were given before, during, or after irradiation at doses that produced only mild nephrotoxicity. All cisplatinum-radiation sequences resulted in decreased renal function, with radiation prior to cisplatinum producing the greatest dysfunction. BCNU increased renal dysfunction equally in all schedules, but mitomycin had only minimal effects. Most drug schedules, including those with mitomycin, produced earlier development of morbidity after fractionated renal irradiation. In a second set of studies, rats were given single doses of the same nephrotoxic drugs, followed 3 months later by total body irradiation plus bone marrow transplant. The drugs had no effect on the marrow ablation dose, but BCNU and cisplatinum decreased gastrointestinal tolerance. Four months after total body irradiation, rats which received drugs alone or total body irradiation alone have essentially normal renal function, but rats which received cisplatinum plus total body irradiation or BCNU plus total body irradiation show a dose-dependent decrease in renal function. These studies show that radiation nephritis can be precipitated by low doses of nephrotoxic drugs, and may help to explain the incidence of early radiation nephritis in bone marrow transplant patients conditioned with total body irradiation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 91%. These 1,586 centers represented 107,804 patients and 28,501 staff members. Over the last 13 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.2% among patients and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of HBsAg-positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.5% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 90% of the centers. By the end of 1988, 17% of susceptible patients and 53% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1988, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg increased from 12 to 20% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1988 was reported to be 1.0% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. Fifteen percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients and 45% reported septicemia. The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 25%. In 1988, 67% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 72% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 2 to 50 (mean, 11) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was reused ranged from 3 to 131 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde; Renalin, a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide; and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were more frequently reported in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was only associated with centers that reused these dialyzers in a manual reprocessing system, a result consistent with those obtained in 1986 and 1987. Eighteen percent of centers reported treating at least some of their patients by high flux dialysis.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In contrast to anhydrous cholesterol which undergoes a polymorphic crystalline transition at 39 degrees C and a crystalline to liquid transition at 151 degrees C, the closed system of cholesterol monohydrate and water exhibited three reversible endothermic transitions at 86, 123, and 157 degrees C. At 86 degrees C, cholesterol monohydrate loses its water of hydration, forming the high temperature polymorph of anhydrous cholesterol. At least 24 hours were required for re-hydration of cholesterol and the rate of hydration was dependent on the polymorphic crystalline form of anhydrous cholesterol. At 123 degrees C, anhydrous crystalline cholesterol in the presence of excess water undergoes a sharp transition to a birefringent liquid crystalline phase of smectic texture. The x-ray diffraction pattern obtained from this phase contained two sharp low-angle reflections at 37.4 and 18.7 A and a diffuse wide-angle reflection centered at 5.7 A, indicating a layered smectic type of liquid crystalline structure with each layer being two cholesterol molecules thick. The liquid crystalline phase is stable over the temperature range of 123 to 157 degrees C before melting to a liquid dispersed in water. The observation of a smectic liquid crystalline phase for hydrated cholesterol correlates with its high surface activity and helps to explain its ability to exist in high concentrations in biological membranes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two hundred fourteen (16%) of the 1,287 renal biopsies obtained between 1962 and 1988 were primary glomerular diseases and 28 of this 214 (13%) were idiopathic membranous nephropathy. On the other hand 59 of 1,287 biopsies were membranous nephropathy of whom 28 were idiopathic, 27 secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, 2 due to drugs, one associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and one more with breast cancer. The clinical picture was: nephrotic syndrome in 84%, hypertension in 15%, non-nephrotic proteinuria in 14%, chronic renal failure in 8.4%, and renal vein thrombosis in 6.3%. In the idiopathic group 75% of the patients were male while in the lupus group 85% were female. For the analysis of progression to chronic renal failure we excluded 5 patients with renal failure when the biopsy was taken, 2 because the nephropathy was due to drugs, one associated with breast cancer, and nine were within the first year of follow-up. Thus, for this analysis the group consisted of 22 patients with idiopathic form and 20 with systemic lupus erythematosus. The idiopathic and lupus groups were similar except for a lower serum albumin in the former. The progression to renal failure was seen in 9 patients: six in the idiopathic group and the other 3 in the lupus group; this difference was not significant.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The Ahb phenotype exhibits greater than 5 femtomole receptor/mg of cytosolic protein, less than or equal to 15 minutes zoxazolamine paralysis time, and twofold to 15-fold induction of these three hepatic enzyme activities; the Ahd phenotype exhibits less than or equal to 2 fmol receptor/mg protein, greater than 15 minutes zoxazolamine paralysis time, and less than 30% induction of these three activities. Among the BXD lines but especially among the B6NXC3N and BXH lines, high frequencies of recombination were found; the phenotype of each of the five parameters did not segregate with the phenotype of each of the other parameters in four or more recombinant lines. This report shows for the first time that AHH induction by 3-methylcholanthrene can occur in the Ahd phenotype mouse.

Sex- and age-matched control groups received corn oil only. Weekly, the urinary excretion of albumin (Alb), alpha 2 mu-globulin (alpha 2 mu) and retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured in 24-hr urine samples using immunoassays specific for rat proteins. N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity was measured by a colorimetric assay. Electrophoretic analysis of proteinuria included SDS-PAGE and isoelectric-focusing of Alb purified from serum and urine. Weekly histopathology comprised light and electron microscopy. In the male rat, a trend toward progressive albuminuria (up to 15 times the pair-fed controls) was observed, together with transient increases in alpha 2 mu and NAG; RBP showed a twofold increase at the end of treatment. Histopathology failed to demonstrate glomerular changes, whereas it displayed alpha 2 mu accumulation and mild lesions in the S2 segment of proximal tubules. Thus, in the male rat, the selective damage to S2 was associated with \"glomerular\" proteinuria, the alpha 2 mu cortical content being closely correlated with albuminuria (n = 9, r = 0.92, P < 0.001). In the female rat, only minor, although statistically significant (P < 0.05), increases were recorded for Alb, whereas urinary alpha 2 mu reached up to four times the control values. As a whole, these findings suggest that PCE, like other hydrocarbons, selectively affects the tubular segment S2 in the rat. A competition with alpha 2 mu for tubular uptake could explain enhanced albuminuria. Owing to the species specificity of alpha 2 mu, caution should be exercised in extrapolating these findings to man. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Exactly 11.2% of all cancer patients but only 3.6% of noncancer patients had complement-fixing antinuclear antibody that reacted with all substrates. Only sera from hepatocellular carcinoma reacted with subsets of the tumor cell substrates. These sera reacted with hepatocellular carcinoma cells and nonhepatic cancer cells (antitumor) or only with one or more of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B and Mahlavu, that were derived from HBsAg-positive patients (antihepatocellular carcinoma).

The nuclear antigen in Mahlavu was expressed as a homogeneous fluorescence that spared the nucleoli, was present in a lower percentage of cells than hepatitis B-associated nuclear antigen and was more thermostable than hepatitis B-associated nuclear antigen. However, it resembled hepatitis B-associated nuclear antigen in kinetics of expression and susceptibility to digestion with DNase, RNase and proteinase K.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms for this insulin resistance, we examined the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4, glucose transporter genes in vastus lateralis muscle from 20 IDDM subjects and 10 nondiabetic controls. Both groups had a mean age of 34 yr and were nonobese. Fasting free plasma insulin levels were similar in control and IDDM subjects but hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose and free fatty acid levels were significantly higher in IDDM subjects. Euglycemic clamp studies over a range of insulin concentrations in these IDDM subjects previously showed both decreased insulin sensitivity and decreased maximally insulin stimulated glucose utilization. In this study, Northern blotting of muscle ribonucleic acid (RNA) revealed a single 3.0-3.5 kb transcript for both GLUT1 and GLUT4 with no change in messenger RNA (mRNA) size or abundance with IDDM. In IDDM subjects, GLUT1 mRNA levels correlated positively with HbA1c whereas GLUT4 mRNA levels correlated negatively with fasting plasma glucose but not with HbA1c. Neither mRNA correlated with fasting plasma insulin or free fatty acid levels or with daily insulin dose. Immunoblotting of total muscle membranes for GLUT4 showed a single band of mol mass of approximately 45 kilodaltons with no change in size or abundance with IDDM. There was no significant correlation between GLUT4 polypeptide levels and HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, or free fatty acids, daily insulin dose, duration of diabetes, or subject age but in IDDM subjects GLUT4 protein levels correlated negatively with body mass index. Thus, impaired expression of glucose transporters in muscle is not essential for the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant glucose uptake in IDDM. No direct regulatory role of chronic glycemic control or plasma insulin levels on GLUT4 expression is evident. In contrast, recent ambient glucose levels may affect levels of GLUT4 mRNA but not GLUT4 protein, suggesting important posttranscriptional regulation of this protein. Since glucose transport has been shown to be rate limiting for glucose utilization in muscle in IDDM, these results suggest impaired translocation or activation of glucose transporters in IDDM. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Studies of the peptides known to contain a stable 3(10)-helix in CDCl3 show the main amide I band of fully stable 3(10)-helices occurs at 1666-1662 cm-1. Resolution-enhancement methods revealed small contributions at 1681-1678 and 1646-1644 cm-1, while the amide II band occurs at 1533-1531 cm-1. Peptides known to contain both alpha- and 3(10)-helices in their structure exhibit bands characteristic of both types of conformation. Peptides known to fold into the beta-bend ribbon structure show an amide I band maximum at 1648-1645 cm-1 with the amide II band at 1538-1536 cm-1. Incorporation of these peptides into model membrane structures, e.g., DMPC vesicles, in aqueous buffer sometimes produces changes in the peptide secondary structure. Those peptides which possess a 3(10)-helical structure in CDCl3 solution change the secondary structure in DMPC vesicles to predominantly alpha-helical, plus a contribution from short, unstable 3(10)-helix and/or beta-turns. Those peptides which contain a combination of alpha- and 3(10)-helical structures in CDCl3 solution tend to retain some 3(10)-helical structure within the lipid environment, although the overall H-bonding pattern is altered. Those peptides which form a beta-bend ribbon structure appear to be largely unaffected in the membrane environment.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

With increasing stimulus strength these action potentials become prolonged. When the peak voltage exceeds about 140 mV the repolarizing phase is blocked until the end of the stimulus. Perfusion experiments show that the rising phase of the action potential results from an increase in calcium permeability in the lumenal membranes. Perfusion of the lumen with cobalt or with a zero calcium solution containing EGTA blocks the action potential. Perfusion of the lumen with a solution containing 10 mM Ca and 20 mM EGTA initially slows the repolarizing process at all voltages and lowers the potential at which it is blocked. With prolonged perfusion, repolarization is blocked at all voltages. When excitability is abolished by perfusion with cobalt, or with a zero calcium solution containing EGTA, no delayed rectification occurs. We suggest that repolarization during the action potential depends on an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, and that the rate of repolarization depends on the magnitude of the inward calcium current. Increasingly large stimuli reduce the rate of repolarization by reducing the driving force for calcium, and then block repolarization by causing the lumenal membrane potential to exceed ECa. Changes in extracellular calcium affect repolarization in a manner consistent with the resulting change in ECa. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although the amount of heparin released and accumulated in vitro from those heparinized parts was very low and stable (on the order of 1 x 10(-2) U/cm2/min), partial thromboplastin time evaluated in vivo was not elongated during passage through the ACUS. Extracorporeal circulation time with the ACUS in unheparinized dog model was 458 +/- 302 min (n = 24), whereas those of partially modified (antithrombogenic) system did not exceed 100 min. As compared with that in a conventional continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration system, an extracorporeal circulation with the ACUS in an unheparinized dog model revealed significantly less fluctuation of platelet count, and no adherent platelets were observed on the surface of the PAN-PEO membrane. An ACUS consisting of a PAN-PEO membrane and heparinized parts was thus demonstrated to have good platelet compatibility. An ACUS with a surface area of 0.25 m2 was applied to two patients with acute renal failure. Hemofiltration without systemic heparinization lasted for 44 h per hemofilter, and a stable level of ultrafiltration was maintained. This system seems to be applicable for the clinical management of volume overload, especially in patients with bleeding tendencies or postoperative bleeding. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Among the processes which vasopressin can influence are several of significance in the symptom-complex of affective illness, including alterations in memory, changes in pain sensitivity, synchronisation of biological rhythms, the timing and quality of R.E.M. sleep, and the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. In addition, vasopressin is functionally linked to monoamine neurotransmitter systems and, like them, is altered by pharmacological agents which affect mood. Some of the pharmacological and clinical data suggest that vasopressin function is diminished in depression and augmented in mania; sometimes, however, alterations in vasopressin function may be detectable only during crucial periods of the manic-depressive cycle. The hypothesis that vasopressin plays a role in disorders of human behaviour, particularly manic-depressive illness, can now be directly tested by radioimmunoassays of vasopressin in C.S.F. and plasma and by the administration of specific vasopressin analogues and inhibitors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, 40% of NBs which lack N-myc amplification are also clinically aggressive. Factors other than N-myc copy number must therefore play a role in determining tumor progression in these NBs. We have established an unusual human NB cell line (NBL-S) from the primary tumor of a patient with rapidly progressive disease which lacks N-myc amplification. The doubling time in vitro (48 h) and the time from injection of 2 x 10(7) cells to detectable tumors in nude mice (46 days) in similar to NB cell lines with amplified N-myc. However, karyotype analysis reveals no evidence of double minutes (DMs), homogeneously staining regions (HSRs), or chromosome 1p deletions, features commonly seen in NB cell lines. The cells have the cell surface phenotype typical of N-myc amplified NB (HLA-A,B,C negative and HSAN 1.2 positive), and similar to other NB cell lines, N-myc RNA and protein are expressed. Interestingly, the half-life of the N-myc protein in NBL-S is prolonged (approximately 100 min) compared to the short N-myc protein half-life previously described in N-myc amplified NB cell lines (approximately 30 min). Because N-myc protein is thought to have a regulatory role, prolongation of the half-life of this protein may be an important factor in the regulation of growth in NBs which lack N-myc amplification and rapidly progress. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A 111-base pair subfragment (-389 to -279) of this region interacts specifically in a gel shift assay with a protein present in hepatic nuclear protein extracts. This protein, designated P1, was not present in extracts of other tissues, even those in which the gene is expressed and hormonally regulated. The binding activity of P1 is exceedingly low in extracts from hypothyroid rats and is markedly increased by administration of thyroid hormone. However, the slow accumulation of P1 after thyroid hormone administration indicates that increased levels of P1 are not necessary for the acute hormonal induction of S14 gene expression. The level of P1 binding activity increases in the evening, synchronous with circadian variation of hepatic mRNA S14. Since neither P1 binding activity nor circadian variation in mRNA-S14 levels are observed in the other tissues expressing the S14 gene, P1 may function to modulate the circadian rhythm observed in hepatic S14 gene expression. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that P1 binds to a defined nucleotide sequence, 5'-AAAAGAGCTATTGATTGCCTGCA-3', located between -310 and -288 in the S14 gene. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Incubation of hepatocytes isolated from phenobarbital-induced adult male rats with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of N6,O2'-dibutyryl-cAMP (diBtcAMP) or glucagon resulted in the phosphorylation of microsomal proteins that are immunoprecipitable by polyclonal antibodies raised to the phenobarbital-inducible P-450 form PB-4 (P-450 gene IIB1). Little or no phosphorylation of these proteins was observed in the absence of diBtcAMP or glucagon or in the presence of activators of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that these 32P-labeled microsomal proteins consist of a mixture of P-450 PB-4 and the closely related P-450 PB-5 (gene IIB2), both of which exhibited heterogeneity in the isoelectric focusing dimension. Phosphorylation of both P-450 forms was markedly enhanced by diBtcAMP at concentrations as low as 5 microM. In contrast, little or no phosphorylation of P-450 forms reactive with antibodies to P-450 PB-1 (gene IIC6), P-450 2c (gene IIC11), or P-450 PB-2a (gene IIIA1) was detected in the isolated hepatocytes under these incubation conditions. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 32P-labeled P-450 PB-4 + PB-5 immunoprecipitate revealed that these P-450s are phosphorylated on serine in the isolated hepatocytes. Peptide mapping indicated that the site of phosphorylation in hepatocytes is indistinguishable from the site utilized by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro, which was previously identified as serine-128 for the related rabbit protein P-450 LM2.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The expected responses to a counterphase grating, given a strictly linear model, would be the sum of the responses to the two drifting components. The measured responses were not consistent with the linear prediction. For example, nearly all cells showed two positions where the responses approached zero (i.e. two \"null phase positions\"); this was true, even for the most direction selective cells. However, the measured responses were consistent with the hypothesis that direction selectivity is a consequence of the linear spatiotemporal receptive-field structure, coupled with the nonlinearities revealed by the contrast-response function: contrast gain control, halfwave rectification, and expansive exponent. When arranged in a particular sequence, each of these linear and nonlinear mechanisms performs a useful function in a general model of simple cells. The linear spatiotemporal receptive field initiates stimulus selectivity (for direction, orientation, spatial frequency, etc.). The expansive response exponent enhances selectivity. The contrast-set gain control maintains selectivity (over a wide range of contrasts, in spite of the limited dynamic response range and steep slope of the contrast-response function).

[3H]NE uptake occurred in strips from the bladder base and body, but was very prominent in the base where the noradrenergic innervation is most dense. Electrical field stimulation markedly increased [3H]NE outflow from the superfused tissue. The quantity of [3H]NE release was approximately equal during three consecutive periods of stimulation. Activation of presynaptic muscarinic receptors by 1.0 microM oxotremorine reduced [3H]NE release to 46% of the control. Atropine (1 microM) blocked the effect of oxotremorine and increased the release to 147% of predrug control levels. Activation of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors by 1 microM clonidine reduced [3H]NE release to 55% of control. Yohimbine blocked the action of clonidine and increased the release to 148% of control. The release of [3H]NE from the bladder base and body was increased by both 1 microM atropine (to 167% and 174% of control, respectively) and 1 microM yohimbine (to 286% and 425% of control, respectively). Atropine and yohimbine administered in combination had similar facilitatory effects as when administered alone. We conclude that the release of [3H]NE from adrenergic nerve endings in electrically stimulated bladder strips is modulated via endogenous transmitters acting on both muscarinic and alpha-2 adrenergic presynaptic receptors and that the latter provide the most prominent control. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to give further information on the supposed hypothalamic pituitary involvement in this effect, we studied the influence of dexamethasone on this stimulative influence of CT. Six healthy women aged 50-65 years were investigated. All the subjects received 100 U CT salmon (Sandoz) i.v. at 0800 (0 time). Plasma beta-endorphin, ACTH, and cortisol were estimated every 30 min from -30 to 120 min by specific radioimmunoassays. The same subjects were evaluated a second time, at the same intervals, when 1 mg dexamethasone was administered per os at 11 PM the previous night and CT i.v. at 0800 the next morning. Beta-endorphin, ACTH, and cortisol levels (mean +/- SEM) rose significantly after 100 U CT from 5.6 +/- 0.17 to 16.75 +/- 1.8 pmol/L (p less than 0.001); from 39.6 +/- 6 to 88.0 +/- 3.1 pg/ml (p less than 0.0001) (from 8.7 +/- 1.3 to 19.4 +/- 0.7 pmol/L); and from 13.1 +/- 1.6 to 23.8 +/- 3.0 micrograms/dl (p less than 0.0001) [374 +/- 45 to 680 +/- 85 nmol/L], respectively.

Two arylamines with known human exposure, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) and 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), have been examined as substrates for 10 different purified rat hepatic cytochromes P-450 and for human liver microsomal preparations from 22 individuals. Metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and flow scintillation techniques. As reported for certain other carcinogenic arylamines, the isosafrole-inducible isozyme, P-450ISF-G, had the highest catalytic activity for ABP N-oxidation (13.6 nmol/min/nmol P-450), but P-450BNF-B, P-450UT-A, P-450UT-F, and P-450PB-B also showed appreciable activity. Ring-oxidation of ABP occurred only to a minor extent. In contrast, N-oxidation of MOCA was preferentially catalyzed by the phenobarbital-inducible enzymes, P-450PB-B and P-450PB-D (9.0 and 6.6 nmol/min/nmol P-450, respectively). MOCA ring-oxidation and methylene carbon oxidation showed varied cytochrome P-450 selectivity and accounted for 14 to 79% of total oxidation products. There was a 44-fold variation in rates of ABP N-oxidation in the 22 human liver microsomal preparations, while rates of N-oxidation of MOCA varied only 8-fold. Ring/methylene carbon-oxidation of MOCA accounted for 6-19% of total oxidation products in the case of the human microsomal preparations, whereas ring-oxidation of ABP accounted for less than 7% of total oxidation. In addition, there was a strong correlation (R = 0.90) between rates of ABP N-oxidation and phenacetin O-deethylation, which is considered a human genetic polymorphism. Moreover, both the ABP N-oxidation and phenacetin O-deethylation activities of human liver microsomes showed a good correlation (R = 0.72) with the levels of cytochrome P-450 immunochemically related to rat P-450ISF-G. These data indicate that specific inducible and constitutive cytochromes P-450 are involved in the metabolic activation and detoxification of the carcinogens ABP and MOCA. Therefore, individual profiles of cytochromes P-450, affected by both environmental and genetic factors, may be significant determinants of individual susceptibility to arylamine carcinogenesis. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The most selective agent at inducing endothelium-dependent relaxation was M&B 22948, which caused little relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings at concentrations that produced almost complete relaxation of endothelium-containing rings. Although endothelium-dependent components of relaxation induced by papaverine and IBMX were clearly present, they were less well separated from the endothelium-independent components of relaxation. In the aorta of the rabbit, M&B 22948 and papaverine were less affective at inducing an endothelium-dependent component of relaxation than in the aorta of the rat, and IBMX produced no discernible endothelium-dependent component. The endothelium-dependent components of relaxation induced by M&B 22948, papaverine and IBMX on rat and rabbit aorta were probably dependent on endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), because they were associated with concomitant endothelium-dependent rises in cyclic GMP, and these components of relaxation as well as the rises in cyclic GMP were completely blocked by the EDRF-blocking agent hemoglobin. The action of hemoglobin was entirely specific, as none of the endothelium-independent components of relaxation induced by any of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors was affected by this hemoprotein. It is likely that the phosphodiesterase inhibitors induce their endothelium-dependent components of relaxation by inhibiting the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP formed in response to EDRF released spontaneously from endothelial cells.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(b) The amount of ornithine normally in the cytosol is about 0.3% of the cellular ornithine, as shown by the kinetics of incorporation of 14C into putrescine via the cytosolic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17). (c) Mitochondria, the site of ornithine synthesis, contain about 1% of the cellular ornithine, as demonstrated by the kinetics of incorporation of 14C into citrulline via the mitochondrial enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.3). (d) Considerable ornithine exchange, and a net efflux of ornithine, takes place across the mitochondrial membrane. (e) Ornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13), a catabolic enzyme, may have a special relation to the cell membrane in cells grown in minimal medium. This enzyme uses ornithine efficiently while it enters from the medium, but very poorly after all the [14C] ornithine is within the cell. (f) Citrulline and proline are not compartmented with respect to the enzymes using them. (g) In contrast, arginine is distributed such that over 99% is in vesicles.

In the 95-mm CRL, hypertrophy of the chondrocytes occurred in the central region of the vertebrae, and blood vessels penetrated there from dorsal and ventral sides of the vertebral body. The primary marrow was represented by liberated cartilage lacunnae, occupied by the thin-walled blood vessels and a few mesenchymal cells and mononuclear cells containing granules or vacuoles (GMC). In the 99-mm CRL, chondroclasts were active in removing the cartilage near the central region of the vertebrae. Consequently, a large cavity was formed and occupied by a dilated sinus. GMC were numerous. Osteoblasts and osteocytes were increased in number. Reticular cells with long processes containing large amounts of glycogen began to appear in the extravascular space and formed the loosely arranged cellular meshwork of the hematopoietic compartment. Bundles of collagen fibrils were scattered in the meshwork. Hematopoietic cells were recognizable only in the 105-mm-CRL fetus and increased in number in the 120-mm-CRL fetus. The sinus endothelium was very thin and continuous without apertures except where blood cells crossed the wall. The developing blood cells lying against the outside of the sinus endothelium indented it. At points, collagen fibrils attached to the outside of endothelial cells and appeared to function as the anchoring filaments of lymphatics.

Thereafter, she had repeated stroke-like episodes, including headache, vomiting, convulsions, hemiparesis and left ehemianopsia. She had neither muscle weakness, fatigability nor atrophy. Laboratory examinations disclosed elevated lactate and pyruvate levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluids, transient focal low density areas on brain CT and right sensorineural deafness by audiometry. No ragged-red fibers (RRF) were found in the first biopsy at 13 years and 6 months of age, and two RRF-like fibers containing red granular materials in the subsarcolemnal regions in the second at 15 years and 3 months of age. A biochemical assay on the two biopsied muscles demonstrated normal enzyme activities in the mitochondrial electron transport system. She was diagnosed as having MELAS because of remarkable mitochondrial abnormalities in smooth muscle cells in the intramuscular arterioles which were clearly demonstrated by succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) stain and on electron microscopy. It was suggested that the stroke-like episodes in this patient were induced by a preferential damage to the mitochondria in the blood vessel walls.

(1) The observations of Sacks et al.

When the brains are removed by freeze-blowing, the time courses of the [14C]deoxyglucose and [14C]deoxyglucose-6-phosphate concentrations in brain during the 45 min after the intravenous pulse are close to those predicted by the model of the deoxyglucose method. (2) Their observation of a reversal of the cerebral arteriovenous difference from positive to negative for [14C]deoxyglucose and not for [14C]glucose after an intravenous infusion of either tracer is, contrary to their conclusions, not a reflection of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in brain but the consequence of the different proportions of the rate constants for efflux and phosphorylation for these two hexoses in brain and is fully predicted by the model of the deoxyglucose method. (3) It is experimentally demonstrated that there is no significant arteriovenous difference for glucose-6-phosphate in brain, that infusion of [32P]glucose-6-phosphate results in no labeling of brain, and that the blood-brain barrier is impermeable to glucose-6-phosphate.

The enzyme was purified 21-fold to homogeneity with 19% recovery by a series of chromatographies using anion-exchange, hydroxylapatite, hydrophobic interaction, and MonoQ anion-exchange columns. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be approximately 210,000 by gel filtration, while the molecular weight of its subunit was 46,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which indicates that the native enzyme is composed of four homologous subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 4.9. The tryptophanase was stable to heating at 65 degrees C for 20 min and the optimum temperature for the enzyme activity for 20 min reaction was 70 degrees C. The optimum pH was 7.0. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this tryptophanase shows similarity to that of Escherichia coli K-12, despite a great difference in the thermostability of these two enzymes. The purified enzyme catalyzed the degradation (alpha, beta-elimination) of L-tryptophan into indole, pyruvate, and ammonia in the presence of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The Km value for L-tryptophan was 1.47 mM. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-methyl-DL-tryptophan, L-cysteine, S-methyl-L-cysteine, and L-serine were also used as substrates and converted to pyruvate.

The purpose of this work was the re-evaluation of these previous findings. Rapid recovery of the enzyme from small tissue samples was achieved by homogenization in 1 M KCl and centrifugation. When the enzyme was prepared by this method from ouabain-exposed rabbit and dog hearts, ouabain remained bound to the enzyme. The extent of inhibition of the enzyme was measured by the fluorimetric assay of K+-dependent 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase before and after removal of bound ouabain. Correlation between the extent of inhibition of this activity and that of (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity was established. Utilizing these refined methods, the following results were obtained. In the rabbit heart, positive inotropy and enzyme inhibition occurred concomitantly. Washout of the effect resulted in partial reactivation of the enzyme. In the dog heart, the previous findings were confirmed. The results are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that enzyme inhibition is the cause of the positive inotropic effects.

In comparison with BALF eosinophil numbers in naive animals of 0.82 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) cells, those in sensitized animals before challenge and 17 and 72 h after challenge were 1.48 +/- 0.2 x 10(6), 2.60 +/- 0.6 x 10(6), and 4.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) cells, respectively. BALF eosinophils from all these groups were notable for their heterogeneity with respect to density, size, and appearance under the electron microscope. In comparison with peritoneal eosinophils, which had a single mean density peak of 1.088 +/- 0.001 g/ml, BALF cells comprised hypodense (less than 1.080 g/ml), normodense (1.080 to 1.096 g/ml), and hyperdense (greater than 1.096 g/ml) eosinophils. The percentage of hypodense eosinophils rose from 25% in naive animals to 63% in sensitized animals (P less than 0.001) and fell after challenge. In contrast, challenge induced the appearance of hyperdense eosinophils, which rose from 6% in sensitized animals to 42% 72 h after challenge (P less than 0.001). Blood eosinophils in naive animals showed a similar profile to those in the lung, but after sensitization and challenge no gross changes in the proportion of either hypodense or hyperdense eosinophils were observed. Flow cytometric analysis of BALF eosinophils indicated that hypodense eosinophils, with a mean diameter of 15.8 microns, were larger than both normodense and hyperdense eosinophils, which had mean diameters of 14.3 and 11.6 microns, respectively. Although the numbers and size of granules were not reduced in hypodense BAL eosinophils, electron microscopy morphology indicated a reduced granular content.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Sterculic acid, an inhibitor of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase system, when added to the culture medium, inhibited the production of monoenoic fatty acids through de novo synthesis by 90% while the production of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol was unaffected. Sterculic acid also inhibited 18:1 formation through desaturation of exogenous stearate (18:0) by 80%. These results indicate that the stearoyl-CoA desaturase system is responsible for most, if not all, of the 18:1 produced within these cells and that an alternate, sterculic acid-insensitive, pathway for 18:1 biosynthesis is not functioning in this cell line. Measurements of fatty acid synthesis, using 3H2O, show that de novo synthesis accounts for approx. 30% of the cellular 16:1 and 18:1 mass, while contributing 63% and 95% of the stearate and palmitate mass, respectively. Cells grown in the presence of sterculic acid displayed a 50% decrease in 18:1 levels while levels of both palmitate and stearate increased. These effects were maximal at 20-30 microM sterculate. Polyunsaturate levels were unaffected. The 50% decrease in 18:1 levels in treated cells could be completely accounted for by the inhibition of de novo 18:1 biosynthesis and the inhibition of exogenous 18:0 desaturation. This enzyme system, although low in activity when measured in this tissue, is responsible for a major portion of the 18:1 observed in these cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cell cultures were infected with the NADL-2 strain of PPV at 0.1 multiplicity of infection. PBL cultures were stimulated with the following phytomitogens: phytohemagglutinin M, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen. Unstimulated PBL cultures infected with PPV and uninfected PBL stimulated with phytomitogens served as controls. All cultures were examined daily for PPV-specific immunofluorescence and hemagglutinin. PPV replicated in PBL cultures stimulated with all phytomitogens. Both viral hemagglutinin in culture fluids and nuclear immunofluorescence in cells were detected. In contrast, unstimulated PBL did not support viral replication; however, PPV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm. PPV persisted in unstimulated PBL for 21 days (duration of the experiment) without replication, but replicated each time with the addition of phytohemagglutinin M at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after infection. Uninfected PBL stimulated with phytomitogens lacked both viral hemagglutinin and immunofluorescence. Simultaneous detection of lymphocyte surface marker and viral antigens in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated PBL revealed that both T and non-T cells (B and null cells) are able to support PPV replication. Peripheral blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages phagocytized PPV but did not support virus replication. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The aim of this study was to determine whether NEFA replacement in such animals would prevent the increase in Rd. In each of three protocols there was an 80-min tracer equilibration period, a 40-min basal period, and a 3-h test period. During the test period in the first protocol saline was infused, in the second protocol somatostatin was infused along with intraportal replacement amounts of insulin and glucagon (\"hormone replacement\"), while in the third protocol somatostatin plus the pancreatic hormones were infused with concurrent heparin plus Intralipid infusion (\"hormone replacement + NEFA\"). Glucose turnover was assessed using [3-3H]glucose. The peripheral levels of insulin, glucagon, and glucose were similar and constant in all three protocols; however, during somatostatin infusion, exogenous glucose infusion was necessary to maintain euglycemia. The NEFA level was constant during saline infusion and decreased in the hormone replacement protocol. In the hormone replacement plus NEFA protocol, the NEFA level did not change during the first 90-min period and then increased during the second 90-min period. Rd was constant during saline infusion, increased in the hormone replacement protocol, but was constant in the hormone replacement plus NEFA protocol. After a prolonged fast in the dog, 1) somatostatin directly or indirectly inhibits adipose tissue NEFA release and causes a decrease in the plasma NEFA level, and 2) this decrease in the NEFA level causes an increase in Rd. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Forty-six of 82 eyes (56.1%) had diffuse field loss and 36/82 (43.9%) eyes had no diffuse field loss according to the cumulative defect curves. Various foveal threshold criteria including temporal transfer and color vision were tested in all eyes. All criteria showed a loss of sensitivity in the presence of diffuse field loss. The loss of sensitivity was statistically significant for the high-frequency end of the foveal temporal contrast-sensitivity function (P = 0.0498), for foveal flicker-fusion frequency (P = 0.0275) and for foveal and parafoveal blue-on-yellow sensitivity (fovea: P = 0.0009; 4 parafoveal points: P = 0.0001; 16 points in the central 10 degrees: P < 0.0001). The loss in sensitivity was not statistically significant for the low and intermediate temporal frequencies of the foveal temporal contrast-sensitivity function and for the FM 100-Hue loss score. All temporal threshold criteria showed a low sensitivity (25-37%) and a low negative predictive value (48-50%) for the presence of diffuse field loss. Their specificity (75-94%) and positive predictive value (65-83%) are high, however. Thus, whenever one of the foveal temporal threshold criteria as used in the present study is abnormal, the probability is very high that there is some diffuse field loss. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The present study examined PMN CL in the absence of phagocytosis using sodium fluoride (NaF), a nonparticulate agent and known stimulator of cellular oxidative metabolism. Normal human and canine PMNs were assayed in a CL spectrometer which permitted continuous sample mixing and constant temperature regulation during CL measurement. PMNs treated with 20 mM NaF demonstrated maximum CL responses of 10,000-20,000 cpm above background, 13-17 min after addition of NaF at 37 degrees C. Temperature regulation of reaction mixtures was found to be a critical factor in assaying PMN CL responses to NaF, because a small decrease in temperature (i.e. 1.5 degrees C) substantially depressed and delayed the CL response. Superoxide anion production correlated closely with CL responses in NaF-treated human PMNs. CL responses were completely suppressed in the presence of the oxidative metabolic inhibitors, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmalemide; and were partially suppressed in the presence of either superoxide dismutase or sodium azide.CL responses of NaF-treated PMNs were significantly lower than responses generated by PMNs phagocytizing opsonized yeast. When NaF was evaluated for its effect on light generation from a singlet oxygen dependent CL reaction, it was found that NaF did not quench singlet oxygen light. This study demonstrates that PMN CL can occur in the absence of phagocytosis, and it proposes that a nonphagocytic PMN CL assay may be useful in evaluating leukocyte metabolic defects. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The first group consisted of 78 cases carried out without using Laser at the Port-Royal maternity unit, and the second group was of 94 cases where CO2 Laser was used at the Hospital Saint-Jacques. All the patients who had plastic tubal operations with associated lysis of adhesions were followed by laparoscopic assessment on the 8th day after operation to see what the results were. The adhesions in the pelvis were classified according to the international classification of Madrid and the lysis operations were classified according to the type of adhesions, i.e. 2nd degree for Type B adhesions, 3rd degree for severe Type C adhesions. In the 1st group, 136 adnexae were treated, associated with 65 2nd degree lysis procedures and 71 3rd degree procedures. In the 2nd group there were 158 adnexae operated on with 53 lysis of the 2nd degree and 105 of the 3rd degree. Control laparoscopy on the 8th day showed that in the 2nd degree lysis cases there were 15% in the group that were operated on without Laser and 9% in the group that were operated on with Laser. In the 3rd degree lysis cases there were 25% recurrences recurrences without Laser and 19% if the Laser was used. It does seem that using Laser improves the results of operations for lysis of adhesions although there was no statistically significant difference (p greater than 0.05). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Auditory brain-stem potentials (BAEPs) and mid-latency potentials (MLPs) to monaural rarefaction click stimuli were recorded as the potential difference between midline skull screws and mastoid electrodes. Hyperthermia was induced by a combined passive heat and work stress in a climatic chamber. Brain temperature was monitored with a thermistor in the parietal lobe. Hyperthermia resulted in a progressive decrease in the absolute latencies of the BAEPs up to the time of heat-induced collapse. There was a similar decrease in the latencies of MLPs up to a brain temperature of 42.0 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C (mean +/- S.D.), while there was prolongation of latencies at higher brain temperatures. The wave form of the BAEPs (I-V) persisted up to the time of heat-induced collapse. In contrast those of MLPs showed reproducible changes in the form of flattening or splitting of the Pa wave at a brain temperature of 41.8 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C, reversible with cooling. That temperature was also associated with behavioural changes reversible with cooling. A complete loss of the MLP waves occurred at a brain temperature of 42.9 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C which was not reversed with whole body cooling and immediately preceded the heat-induced collapse. This study demonstrates that hyperthermia in the conscious sheep produces potentially damaging effects on the central nervous system once a critical brain temperature (41.8 degrees C +/- 7.0 degrees C) is exceeded and that the MLPs are more sensitive indicators of this damage than BAEPs. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Polystyrene beads (1/4'') as the solid-phase are prepared by coating the balls with purified IgG from the serum of rabbits (9-12 micrograms/bead) in Coating-Buffer pH 9.6. After washing the balls they are saturated with 10% BSA or 10% FCS in PBS-Tween 20. The bacteria bound to the coated balls are detected by the specific peroxidase labelled IgG. This EIA using Ps. aeruginosa (P9) as a model is able to detect this bacterium within 5 hours, with stored coated balls 3.5 hours, with a detection limit of 10(4) CFU. Nine Pseudomonas-strains react stronger than other strains. These cross-reactions can be substantially reduced by absorbing the P9-conjugate with the cells of Ps. stutzeri (P15). With the other Pseudomonas-strains a high specificity is found with the P9-conjugate. After modifying this EIA for the detection of Ps. mallei (P18) the strains Ps. mallei (P57), Ps. pseudomallei (P17) and Ps. cepacia (P67) react with the P18-conjugate. With the other tested strains a high specificity is found at 10(7) CFU. The polystyrene bead-EIA is recommended as a sensitive and specific test for the detection of Ps. aeruginosa in about 5 resp. 3.5 hours. It only requires normal laboratory equipment and is thus a highly practicable method for routine diagnostic of Ps. aeruginosa. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The external horizontal cell is more distally positioned in the retina and has a much larger cell body than does the internal horizontal cell. However, both external and internal horizontal cells extend processes to the photoreceptor terminals where they end as lateral elements adjacent to the synaptic ribbons within the terminal invaginations. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies on isolated cells similar in appearance to those seen in situ showed that both types displayed five separate voltage-sensitive conductances: a TTX-sensitive sodium conductance, a calcium current, and three potassium-mediated conductances (an anomalous rectifier, a transient outward current resembling an A current, and a delayed rectifier). There was, however, a striking difference between external and internal horizontal cells in the magnitude of the current carried by the anomalous rectifier. Even after compensating for differences in the surface areas of the two cell types, the sustained inward current elicited by hyperpolarizing voltage steps was a significantly greater component of the current profile of external horizontal cells. A difference between external and internal horizontal cells was seen also in the magnitudes of their TEA-sensitive currents; larger currents were usually obtained in recordings from internal horizontal cells. However, the currents through these K+ channels were quite small, the TEA block was often judged to be incomplete, and except for depolarizing potentials greater than or equal to +20 mV (i.e., outside the normal operating range of horizontal cells), this current did not provide a reliable indicator of cell type. The fact that two classes of horizontal cell can be distinguished by their electrophysiological responses, as well as by their morphological appearance and spatial distribution in the retina, suggests that they may play different roles in the processing of visual information within the retina. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Three sedentary men underwent a 3-mo period of endurance training in a temperate climate, (dry bulb temperature (Tdb): 18 degrees C) and had their sweating sensitivity measured before and after the training period. Mean maximum oxygen uptake (Vo2max, ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) was: skiers: 66.5; swimmers 65.8; sedentary men, pretraining 40.9; posttraining: 48.3 (+18%). Sweat output of athletes under a given stress (passive heating) was markedly higher than that of sedentary men. Skiers exhibited a high level of heat tolerance and were better acclimatized than swimmers, although they had never experienced exposure to heat. The increase in Vo2max of sedentary men was accompanied by 1) an increase in sweating sensitivity with a decrease of body heat storage at steady state (pretraining: 5.4 kJ.kg(-1); posttraining: 3.5 kJ.kg(-1); P less than 0.05); 2) significant shift down the temperature scale with reduced rectal temperature (Tre) for sweat onset; 3) an increase of gain constants of sweating (W.m-2 degrees C(-1) (pretraining: 168; posttraining: 269; gain constant of swimmers: 222). It was suggested that endurance training in cold or temperate conditions with significant increase of Vo2max could act on the thermoregulatory function in a way similar to body heating procedures, such as work in heat, and could contribute to heat acclimatization. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Early gut feeding may augment hepatic hemodynamics and avoid relative ischemia in this flow-limited environment. To examine these effects, canines were instrumented with arterial, pulmonary artery, portal, and hepatic vein catheters. Splenectomy and gastrostomy were performed and the hepatic artery and portal vein were encircled with flow probes. All animals underwent lung injury with oleic acid (0.08 ml/kg) followed by the addition of 10 cm H2O PEEP to correct shunt. One group (fed) was then given a bolus elemental feeding (1 kcal/ml, 10 ml/kg) and the Control group, sterile water. Cardiac index (CI), HBF, hepatic oxygen delivery (HO2D), and hepatic oxygen consumption (HO2C) were measured at baseline (T0), after PEEP (T1), and 1 (T2) and 2 hr (T3) after feeding. Data were tested for significant changes between time points in the same group by ANOVA and significant differences were subjected to t testing. PEEP significantly decreased CI, HBF, and HO2D compared to baseline. Subsequently, gut feeding increased HBF to baseline levels and improved HO2D. HO2C also increased but hepatic O2 extraction was unchanged. There was little change noted in the control group over this same period. We conclude that gut feeding augments HBF and HO2D in this flow-limited state and may preserve splanchnic integrity in critical illness. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has been proposed that this increase in Cai may occur as a result of exchange of Nai for Cao, which occurs as a result of an increase in Nai arising from exchange of Nao for H+i. The latter exchange is stimulated by the intracellular acidification that occurs during ischemia. To test this hypothesis, we examined Cai, Nai, ATP, and pHi during ischemia in rats in the presence and absence of 1 mM amiloride, a Na-H exchange inhibitor. Cai was measured using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\\',N\\'-tetra-acetic acid (5F-BAPTA)-loaded rat hearts. Nai was measured using 23Na NMR, and the shift reagent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\\',N\",N\"\\'-tetramethylenephosph onate (Tm[DOTP]-5) was used to separate Nai and Nao. ATP and pH were determined from 31P NMR measurements. During 20 minutes of ischemia, amiloride did not significantly alter the ATP decline but did significantly attenuate the rise in Nai and Cai. After 20 minutes of ischemia, time-averaged Cai was 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM (mean +/- SEM) in amiloride-treated hearts compared with 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM in nontreated hearts. After 20 minutes of ischemia, Nai in the untreated heart was threefold greater than control, whereas in the amiloride-treated heart, Nai was not significantly different from control. These data are consistent with the involvement of Na-Ca exchange in the rise in Cai during ischemia.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The management of asymptomatic patients with stab wounds of the chest is controversial. The results of previous reports have asserted that asymptomatic patients with stab wounds of the chest do not have delayed complications develop if roentgenograms of the chest taken six hours after the injury are normal. This \"rule\" has not been validated. A three year, prospective study of patients with stab wounds of the chest was done. Patients were excluded from the study if they had symptoms on arrival, evidence of physiologic derangement caused by intrathoracic injury, wounds near the subclavian vessels or precordial wounds. Patients with lower thoracic stab wounds were evaluated by diagnostic peritoneal lavage. If findings from lavage were negative, the patients were included in the study. One hundred and five patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study group. All of the patients were hospitalized and examined serially. All had roentgenograms of the chest performed at admission, at six hours and at 24 hours. Four patients had a pneumothorax or hemothorax develop between the time of admission and six hours of hospitalization. In the remaining 101 patients, none had a pneumothorax or hemothorax between six and 24 hours. No patient asymptomatic on admission had a tension pneumothorax develop later. No patient had delayed evidence of abdominal injury. An asymptomatic patient with a stab wound of the chest that is not precordial, not in proximity to the subclavian artery and not suspected of diaphragmatic penetration should be serially examined and have a follow-up roentgenogram of the chest at six hours. If the patient remains asymptomatic and the six hour film is normal, delayed complications are rarely, if ever, encountered and the patient does not require further studies or hospitalization. The six hour rule for stab wounds of the chest is valid. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Variables that best correlated with the occurrence of painless ischemia by quantitative scintigraphic criteria were examined. Fifty-nine patients (57%) had no angina on exercise testing. A significantly greater percent of patients with silent ischemia than of patients with angina had a recent myocardial infarction (31% versus 7%, p less than 0.01), had no prior angina (91% versus 64%, p less than 0.01), had dyspnea as an exercise test end point (56% versus 35%, p less than 0.05) and exhibited redistribution defects in the supply regions of the right and circumflex coronary arteries (50% versus 35%, p less than 0.05). The group with exercise angina had more ST depression (64% versus 41%, p less than 0.05) and more patients with four or more redistribution defects. However, there was no difference between the two groups with respect to mean total thallium-201 perfusion score, number of redistribution defects per patient, multi-vessel thallium redistribution pattern or extent of angiographic coronary artery disease. There was also no difference between the silent ischemia and angina groups with respect to antianginal drug usage, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, exercise duration, peak exercise heart rate, peak work load, peak double (rate-pressure) product and percent of patients achieving greater than or equal to 85% of maximal predicted heart rate for age.

A nonpurified diet was used as a control. After a 28-day experimental period, rabbits fed casein developed hypercholesterolemia compared to those fed the soy protein diet. Serum cholesterol levels of rabbits fed fish protein was intermediate and not different from that of the casein or the soy protein group. However, serum triglycerides were higher in the fish group than in the casein group. Feeding of fish protein resulted in a reduction of hepatic cholesterol compared to casein, indicating no direct relationship between serum and hepatic cholesterol. In addition, fish protein induced a decrease of cholesterol in the low density lipoproteins (LDL) compared to casein and an increase of cholesterol in the high density lipoproteins (HDL) compared to casein and soy protein. Reduction in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and elevation in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) caused a 10-fold decrease in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio of fish protein fed rabbits compared to those fed casein. This ratio was similar to that observed with soy protein which was also lower than the ratio of the casein group. Thus, since the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio has been shown to be a good indicator of the atherosclerosis risk, these results suggest that fish protein, as well as soy protein, may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in rabbits, compared to casein. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Since then the operation with or without modification has been used extensively. High stool frequencies in some series led to disenchantment with the straight anastomosis and to the development of various reservoir procedures to increase rectal capacity and thereby reduce frequency. As a result, no large series of straight pullthroughs is available for comparison with the reservoir modifications. Between September 1977 and September 1986, 72 children and adults, 61 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with familial polyposis, underwent endorectal pullthrough (ERPT) and straight ileoanal anastomosis under the overall direction of a single surgeon (AGC). Sixty patients have undergone ileostomy closure and form the basis of this study. Mean age at operation was 22.7 years (range 4-48 yr), and duration of active disease averaged 6 years. One-half of the patients underwent total abdominal colectomy with ERPT as a primary procedure. There were 11 cases of adhesive bowel obstruction following ERPT, and in six patients in the series permanent revision to a Brooke ileostomy was required. One patient died of hepatic failure in the late postoperative period. Follow-up has ranged from 3 months to 9 years. Mean stool frequency for the group as a whole at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months was 11.8, 11.2, 9.6, 9.0, and 8.3 per 24 hours, respectively. Daytime continence was achieved in all patients.

Use of lectins (Con A, WGA, PHA-E and -L, LCA) allowed to specify the synthesis and release of complex-type glycoproteins that bear high-mannose-carbohydrate chains in their precursor forms and probably triantennary carbohydrate chains in their mature forms. Antibodies raised against SCO extracts were characterized by means of various tests and used to purify specific compounds. Immunopurified fractions using A99 polyclonal antibody contained numerous polypeptides reactive with Con A, their apparent molecular weight (MW) ranging from 240 to 50 kDa. Only two glycopeptides were strongly labeled with WGA (98 and 52/54 kDa MW). Immunopurified fractions using C1B8A8 monoclonal antibody, specific of the complex-type glycoproteins at different steps of glycosylation, showed three specific Con A-reactive polypeptides at 88, 54 and 34 kDa MW. Only the 34 kDa glycopeptide was strongly labeled with WGA. The latter could correspond to the monomeric form of the secreted compound. Electrophoretical analyses of Reissner's fiber material allowed the detection of a WGA-positive smear in the upper part of the blots, suggesting that the complex-type glycoproteins, when released into the CSF, constitute a stable polymer. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A summary is presented of previous studies which indicate that the insulin receptor of fat and liver cells is a large glycoprotein, partially buried in the outer surface of the plasma membrane, with a high (K-D approximately 10-10 M) and specific affinity for insulin. The participation of membrane phospholipids in the binding of insulin and the role of sialic acid residues in the transmission of the insulin binding signal are discussed. The relation of insulin action to its effects on cyclic nucleotide levels is explored. On the one hand, insulin action (glucose transport) is inhibited by compounds (cholera toxin, ACTH, glucagon and L-norepinephrine) that stimulate adenylate cyclase; conversely, insulin both inhibits the lipolytic action of these compounds, and raises cellular levels of cyclic GMP. An hypothesis is presented whereby a single cyclase species may be responsible for the formation of either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, depending on the nature of the hormone stimulus. The role of membrane phosphorylation in the action of insulin is discussed in the context of experiments demonstrating a specific inhibition by ATP of insulin-mediated glucose transport, in association with the phosphorylation of two specific membrane proteins. The ability of insulin to modulate cyclic nucleotide levels in cultured cells and to act as a growth factor is discussed. Insulin stimulates DNA synthesis and the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in human fibroblasts, which effects are also mediated by epidermal growth factor. Insulin acts at concentrations much higher than those obtained in vivo, whereas epidermal growth factor acts at concentrations thought to be physiological. The insulin binding sites (K-D is approximately equal to 10-9 M) related to growth, and observed both in human fibroblasts and in lectin-stimulated and leukemic human lymphocytes would not be appreciably occupied at physiological insulin concentrations. The implications of such 'low affinity' binding sites for insulin are discussed in relation to the action of other growth factors. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Using this assay, we analyzed the levels of viral DNA in trigeminal ganglia of mice inoculated corneally with HSV mutants that are defective for virus replication at one or more sites in mice and for reactivation upon ganglionic explant. Ganglia from mice infected with thymidine kinase-negative mutants, which replicate at the site of inoculation and establish latency but do not replicate acutely in ganglia or reactivate upon explant, contained a range of levels of HSV DNA that overlapped with the range found in ganglia latently infected with wild-type virus. On average, these mutant-infected ganglia contained one copy of HSV DNA per 100 cell equivalents (ca. 10(4) molecules), which was 50-fold less than the average for wild-type virus. Ganglia from mice infected with a ribonucleotide reductase deletion mutant, which is defective for acute replication and reactivation upon ganglionic explant, also contained on average one copy of HSV DNA per 100 cell equivalents. We also detected substantial numbers of HSV DNA molecules (up to ca. 10(3] in ganglia of mice infected with an ICP4 deletion mutant and other replication-negative mutants that are severely impaired for viral DNA replication and gene expression. These results raise the possibility that such mutants can establish latency, which could have important implications for mechanisms of latency and for vaccine and antiviral drug development. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cross-fostering of normal suckling rats onto immune mothers established that passive transfer occurred via the colostrum and milk. Immunoglobulin fractions containing gammaA from immune colostrum were fed to 12-14-day-old rats for 4 days via stomach tube. Significant passive protection against challenge with T. taeniaeformis was achieved with gammaA from one of three colostrum pools. The effect of colostral gammaA preparations on the infectivity of freshly hatched oncopheres of T. taeniaeformis was measured by the intra-intestinal inoculation of immunoglobulin solutions into isolated gut loops containing hatched eggs of the parasite. gammaA from one of three pools of immune colostrum caused a significant reduction in the number of parasites which reached the liver. This appears to be the first time that protective activity against a helminth infection has been achieved with gammaA. A fraction of immune colostrum containing both 7Sgamma1 and 7Sgamma2 immunoglobulins was found to confer passive protection when inoculated parenterally. In view of the prolonged period of absorption (ca 18 days) of 7S immunoglobulins from the gut by the suckling rat, it seems likely that these antibodies are primarily responsible for the natural passive transfer of protection from mother to young. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Gene mutation was tested by inducing mutants resistant to 8-azaguanine and revertants of methG1 in a haploid strain. Somatic crossing-over was tested in heterozygous diploids, both with a selective method, i.e. inducing homozygosis to FPA resistance in a heterozygous fpa A1/+ strain, and with a non-selective method, i.e. identifying the frequencies of colour sectors. This latter method was also used to estimate the induction of non-disjunction because additional markers were present which permitted us to distinguish the two types of colour segregant. Generally, 3 different experimental procedures were used, namely the \"plate test\", i.e. plating of conidia in agar media containing MMS, and two types of \"liquid test\", i.e. brief treatment of quiescent or pre-germinated conidia in MMS solution before they were plated on agar media. Point mutations were induced with about equal efficiency with each method, whereas crossing-over was induced preferentially when germinating conidia were exposed to MMS. On the other hand, non-disjunction was induced in germinating and quiescent spores with equal efficiency, but such segregants were not recovered with the selective (fpa) method. The results are discussed for both their practical use in the mutagenic testing procedure and their theoretical implication. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ca2+ mobilization activated by substance P, bombesin, or muscarinic receptor stimulation was found to involve both Ca2+ release and entry. In addition, depolarization of the surface membrane of AR4-2J cells with elevated concentrations of K+ activated Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ entry induced by membrane depolarization was inhibited by the L-channel antagonist, nimodipine, while that due to surface receptor agonists was not inhibited by this agent. The microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, caused both depletion of the agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool and sustained Ca2+ influx indistinguishable from that produced by bombesin or methacholine. These results confirm that, unlike the pancreatic acinar cells from which they are presumably derived, AR4-2J cells express voltage-sensitive, dihydropyridine-inhibitable Ca2+ channels. However, in contrast to previous reports with this cell line, in the AR4-2J cells in use in our laboratory, and under our experimental conditions, surface receptor agonists (including substance P) do not cause Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Instead, we conclude that agonist-activated Ca2+ mobilization is initiated by (1,4,5)IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release and that Ca2+ influx is regulated primarily, if not exclusively, by the state of depletion of the (1,4,5)IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

During Jan. 1982-Dec. 1986, 65 cases of intracranial meningiomas were diagnosed after operations and pathologic examinations at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. There were 36 females and 29 males, aged from 18 to 80 with a mean of 52 years. Average period of follow-up was 23.7 months. All patients received craniotomy or craniectomy with or without microscopic technique to remove the tumors & 3 cases received postoperative radiotherapy. The most common sites of meningiomas were the posterior fossa, convexity, parasagittal area and falx. The complete removal rate was 84.8%, the mortality rate 9.1% and the morbidity rate 33%. The major complications were intracerebral hemorrhage, infection of central nerve system, and hydrocephalus. There were 3 cases (4.6%) of multiple meningiomas. The most common symptoms and signs in order were headache, hemiparesis, seizure, nausea and vomiting, conscious disturbance & trigeminal neuralgia. The average duration of symptoms was 18.5 months. There were 9 cases of trigeminal neuralgia and 2 cases of hemifacial spasm. There were 3 cases (5.6%) of recurrence and 4 cases (6.1%) of malignancy. The most frequently found subtypes of meningiomas were the meningotheliomatous type and the transitional type. Mean size of the tumors was 5 cm. Tumor location and its biological behavior were closely related to the removal rate, prognosis and recurrence, while tumor size was of less importance. Ability of daily life was improved and seizure was better controlled by antiepileptic drugs in postoperative days. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This action of TSH was antagonized by low concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 0.1-5 nmol/l). The maximal effect of EGF was reached by 0.5 nmol/l. EGF (0.5-5 nmol/l) also inhibited the stimulatory effect of 8-chloro cyclic AMP (0.06-1.0 nmol/l) on radioiodine turnover. Exposure of thyroid cultures to media with a calcium concentration of 17.7 mumol/l (1% of normal) resulted in a very marked increase in the rate of release of radioiodine. The effect of TSH in low-calcium media was to inhibit the increased release of radioiodine, and EGF (0.5 nmol/l) antagonized this inhibitory effect of TSH. The calcium ionophore, A23187, stimulated radioiodine release in a dose-dependent fashion, and EGF (1.7 nmol/l) inhibited this response. Fluid transport in thyroid monolayers was stimulated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 1 mumol/l). EGF (5 nmol/l) also stimulated fluid transport, but antagonized the effect of PGE2 added subsequently. It was concluded that EGF exerted acute antagonistic effects on thyroid cell responses in vitro to cyclic AMP and agents promoting accumulation of cyclic AMP in time-frames too short for these inhibitory effects to be attributable to the dedifferentiative effect of the growth factor. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to reduce this period of time spent in dangerous conditions, an experience of pre-acclimatization was performed with 5 elite alpinists (4 male, 1 female), aged 30 +/- 4 yrs (mean +/- SD), before their attempt to climb Mount Everest. Subjects first remained one week on Mont-Blanc (between 4350 and 4807 m), then spent a total of 38 hours in a hypobaric chamber (in 4 consecutive days) from 5000 to 8500 m standard altitude. Then, they flew to Kathmandu and reached 7800 m five days only after leaving the base camp. The pre-acclimatization period showed a 12% increase in hemoglobin concentration, and no change in ventilatory response to hypoxia. Arterial oxygen saturation at submaximal exercise in hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.115) increased from 75 +/- 4 to 82 +/- 3%, probably because of an efficient ventilatory acclimatization. On Mount Everest, the speed of ascent was very high (5600 m of altitude gain in 6 days), knowing that in conventional expeditions, 12 to 32 days are generally necessary to reach, safe, the same altitude. In conclusion, pre-acclimatization seems to have triggered efficient mechanisms which allowed climbers to save 1 to 3 weeks of time in mountain conditions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Right heart failure was suggested by the presence of hepatomegaly, pretibial edema and also echocardiographic findings. Physical examination and echocardiography showed no evidence of valvular disease or congenital heart disease except for right ventricular dilatation and tricuspid regurgitation. The ventricular septum deviated toward the left ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle, but left ventricular function was preserved. Severe pulmonary hypertension averaging 44 mmHg was revealed by cardiac catheterization. Digital subtraction angiography and pulmonary blood flow scintigraphy showed no evidence of pulmonary artery embolism, and no interstitial pulmonary lesions that might have caused pulmonary hypertension were recognized. Hypergammaglobulinemia suggested an autoimmune disorder, and signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), such as pleural effusion, proteinuria, lymphocytopenia, LE cell phenomenon and antinuclear antibodies were present. Several autoimmune diseases are known to be causative factors of pulmonary hypertension. However, only ten cases of SLE complicated by pulmonary hypertension have been reported the present one. These cases were characterized by a high incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon and positivity for anti-RNP antibody. In our present case, SLE activity was suppressed using prednisolone, but pulmonary hypertension persisted and the patient eventually died due to right cardiac failure. Judging from the clinical course of the ten reported cases of SLE-pulmonary hypertension, there seems to be no hope of improving the pulmonary hypertension once it has become established. Therefore it is important to detect and cure pulmonary hypertension as early as possible. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The population of 120 hypertensive patients were classified in 3 groups: group A, fromed by 104 subjects without EDS stigmata; group B, constitued by 7 cases with hypermobility of one to three metar-carpophalangic joints and group C in which 9 subjects with hipermobility of more than 3 metacarpophalangic joints were included. Neither case of groups A and B showed arteriographic signs of FDRA. In 4 cases of group C there were arteriographic evidence of FDRA (3.3% of the whole population) and stigmata of SED (2 cases with skin biopsy positive for this entity). Two cases of group D showed stigmata of SED and a positive skin biopsy; the other case had a normal histology of skin and no clinical signs of SED. The presence of SED stigmata in a patient with arterial hypertension should alert the clinician in the diagnosis of FRDA; in such a case it is recommended that a renal arteriography be performed. In this paper similarities of SED of the arterial type and some cases of FDRA are remarked and it is proposed the both entities share the same or a very closed molecular collagen defect. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This study evaluates the short- and long-term results of extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction in 65 patients, including 5 children, with renovascular hypertension who were treated from 1974 through 1989. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range, 7 to 67 years). The cause of the stenoses was arteriosclerosis in 8 patients, fibrodysplasia in 54 patients, and miscellaneous in 3. Hypertension was severe before treatment with a mean blood pressure of 187/147 mm Hg that was reduced to a mean of 159/102 mm Hg after medical therapy. Ten patients had renal dysfunction. Results were evaluated both at short-term intervals (mean, 7.9 months; 64 patients) and long-term intervals (mean, 5.9 years; 60 patients), after surgery. Blood pressure responses were classified as beneficial (cured/improved) or failures. Anatomic results were evaluated by angiography in 98% of the patients at the short-term interval and in 77% of the patients at the long-term interval. Extracorporeal renal artery surgery was performed on 78 kidneys among 65 patients (unilateral, 45 patients; bilateral, 13 patients; unilateral extracorporeal and contralateral in situ, 7 patients). In most of the cases autologous arterial graft was used for reconstruction. Early in the series one patient died as a result of the operative procedure (1/65, 1.5%). A beneficial blood pressure response occurred in 53 patients (53/65; 82%) at the short-term interval and in 49 patients (49/61; 80%) at the long-term interval, with the average blood pressure at the short-term interval being 138/85 mm Hg and at the long-term interval being 139/85 mm Hg. Renal function improved in all patients with preoperative renal dysfunction. Graft stenosis or occlusion of the main renal artery was neither observed at the short-term interval nor at the long-term interval. However, residual stenoses were observed in 9 of the 163 reconstructed distal branches (5.5%). Extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction with autologous arterial grafts can be effectively applied to lesions of the distal main renal artery and its hilar branches with durable functional results. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Special emphasis was put on intrarenal vascular impedance and the relative resistive index, first mentioned by Rifkin in 1987. US diagnosis was compared with the results obtained at both biopsy and clinical follow-up. Only long-term renal transplants were considered; the patients were examined for a rise in serum creatinine level or for the onset of other signs/symptoms related to renal allografts. Our results confirm the utility of pulsed Doppler US in the diagnosis of renal transplant rejection, and allow reference values to be established for the resistive index. In agreement with literature data and assuming 0.9 as a resistive index value, Duplex-Doppler US specificity in diagnosing acute rejection was 100%, and sensitivity was 50%. However, the authors believed it more useful to assume 0.8 as a reference value for the resistive index, for it allows more renal transplant rejection episodes to be diagnosed, both acute and chronic, with an acceptable combination of specificity, sensitivity and predictive value. While the differential diagnosis of acute and chronic rejection is hardly ever possible with Duplex US alone, the combined use of Duplex US and real-time US makes it nearly always possible. As far as intrarenal impedance is concerned, our results seem to disagree with the scattered literature data on the subject, and to point towards its possible significant (though not extreme) increase also in case of chronic rejection. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The procedures were performed between March 19, 1970, and March 30, 1972. The patient population included 84 men, and the mean age was 51.4 years. There were 12 patients with single-vessel disease, 36 with double-vessel disease, and 52 with triple-vessel disease, for an average of 2.4 involved vessels per patient. Forty-eight patients were judged to have diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Twelve patients had left main coronary artery stenoses. Each patient received an average of 1.8 saphenous vein grafts. Thirty-six patients underwent repeat coronary artery bypass grafting after an average of 132.8 months and received an average of 3.5 grafts. This resulted in cumulative reoperative rates of 5%, 14%, 27%, and 36% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates were 89.8%, 68.4%, 53.1%, and 40.8%, respectively. Survival was not significantly related to the cause of death, cardiac-related causes being predominant. There were no significant relationships between the length of survival and sex, the number of grafts received, or the presence of left main stenosis. Survival was inversely related to age at initial operation (p = 0.046) as well as initial left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p = 0.033). Survival positively correlated with the occurrence of triple-vessel disease (p = 0.031) and the presence of diffuse disease (p = 0.0077).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Ten competitive cyclists and ten well-trained runners performed two continuous maximal cycle ergometer tests, once with toeclips and once without toeclips. Respiratory data were collected every 20 s and used to determine VT and VO2 max. For cyclists, the mean (congruent to SEM) oxygen uptake at VT (VO2, VT) was greater during the trial with toeclips (48.8 +/- 1.9 ml kg-1 min-1 and 46.9 +/- 1.9 ml kg-1 min-1 during cycle ergometry with and without toeclips, respectively; p less than 0.05). No significant difference in VO2, VT was noted between trials for runners. The cyclists also demonstrated a higher VO2 max during the trial with toeclips (58.8 +/- 3.0 ml kg-1 min-1) compared to the trial without toeclips (54.4 +/- 2.0 ml kg-1 min-1; p less than 0.05). When expressed relative to VO2 max (%VO2 max) the VT during the toeclip trial for cyclists was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that the cyclists in this study developed specific adaptations related to the use of toeclips, and the use of toeclips during cycle ergometry is therefore recommended. We recommend that future studies report results with VT expressed in both absolute (VO2) and relative (%VO2 max) terms. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

For most of the 50 years that the Whipple procedure has been performed, the morbidity and mortality rates have been high, and few long-term survivors have been reported. Over the past decade, a number of institutions have reported a dramatic decline in operative morbidity and mortality as well as an improved survival for those undergoing pancreaticoduodenal resection. Between 1969 and 1986, 88 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenal resection for periampullary cancer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In an effort to detect recent trends in operative morbidity and mortality for those undergoing pancreaticoduodenal resection, the patients were divided into two groups on the basis of two time periods. Forty-one patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary cancer between 1969 and 1981, while 47 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1981 and 1986. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean age, sex distribution, duration of symptoms before presentation or mean weight loss. Likewise, preoperative laboratory data were similar for both groups of patients. In addition, mean tumor size was similar in both groups, as was the incidence of positive lymph nodes. Among the 41 patients operated upon during the first period, hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 59% and 24%, respectively. In contrast, hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 36% and 21%, respectively among the 47 patients operated upon during the recent period.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against cytochrome P450a cross-reacted with cytochromes P450b, P450e, and P450f (which are structurally related to cytochrome P450a). The cross-reacting antibodies were removed by passing anti-P450a over an N-octylamino-Sepharose column containing these heterologous antigens. The immunoabsorbed antibody recognized only a single protein (i.e., cytochrome P450a) in liver microsomes from immature male rats treated with Aroclor 1254 (i.e., the microsomes from which cytochrome P450a was purified). However, the immunoabsorbed antibody recognized three proteins in liver microsomes from mature male rats, as determined by Western immunoblot. As expected, one of these proteins (Mr 48,000) corresponded to cytochrome P450a. The other two proteins did not correspond to cytochromes P450b, P450e, or P450f (as might be expected if the antibody were incompletely immunoabsorbed), nor did they correspond to cytochromes P450c, P450d, P450g, P450h, P450i, P450j, P450k, or P450p. One of these proteins was designated cytochrome P450m (Mr approximately 49,000), the other cytochrome P450n (Mr approximately 50,000). Like cytochrome P450a, cytochrome P450n was present in liver microsomes from both male and female rats. However, whereas cytochrome P450a was detectable in liver microsomes from 1-week-old rats, cytochrome P450n was barely detectable until the rats were at least 3 weeks old. Furthermore, in contrast to cytochrome P450a, the levels of cytochrome P450n did not decline appreciably with age in postpubertal male rats. Cytochrome P450m was detectable only in liver microsomes from postpubertal (greater than 4 week-old) male rats. Cytochromes P450m and P450n were isolated from liver microsomes from mature male rats and purified to remove cytochrome P450a. When reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and lipid, cytochrome P450n exhibited little testosterone hydroxylase activity, whereas cytochrome P450m catalyzed the 15 alpha-, 18-, 6 beta-, and 7 alpha-hydroxylations of testosterone at 10.8, 4.6, 2.0, and 1.9 nmol/nmol P450/min, respectively. The ability of cytochrome P450m to catalyze the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone was not due to contamination with cytochrome P450a, which catalyzed this reaction at approximately 25 nmol/nmol P450a/min. Cytochrome P450m also converted testosterone to several minor metabolites, including androstenedione and 15 beta-, 14 alpha-, and 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Patient survival rate 1, 3 and 5 years following transplantation was better in KP group (93%, 89%, 89%, respectively) and in K group (88%, 88%, 73%, respectively) and in HD group (88%, 62%, 51%, respectively). Kidney graft survival at 1, 3 and 5 years post-transplant was better in KP group (93%, 72%, 72%, respectively) than in K group (76%, 61%, 31%, respectively). 1 year after transplantation, patients of the KP group who had lost the pancreas for technical reasons (thrombosis) were included in the K group so as to evaluate the effect of the transplanted pancreas on long-term patient and kidney survival. Patient survival rate in the KP group (17 patients) at 2 and 4 years was 100%, while at the same intervals it was 78% in the K group (13 patients).

RNA/DNA hybridization experiments at a DNA excess of 1000 demonstrated that normal RNA and immune RNA hybridized identically with DNA extracted from mouse spleen cells before and after immunization and with liver DNA. These findings indicate that DNA sequences complementary to immune RNA or to normal RNA are represented in a number of copies not significantly different in the genome of normal lymphoid cells and in that of immune lymphoid cells. Hybridizations of normal and of immune RNA with normal and immune pulse-labeled DNA, done at RNA excess, detected no differences between these two DNA. However, significant differences were observed in the percentage of DNA hybridized with normal and immune RNA; 3 to 4% of the DNA hybridized with normal RNA and 8 to 9% with immune RNA. This indicates that more DNA sequences are transcribed 48 hr after immunization than before immunization. The RNA exhaustion rates caused by normal and immune DNA were found to be identical, indicating that antigenic stimulation did not induce major changes in the number of DNA base sequences complementary to the RNA tested. However, when normal and immune pulse-labeled RNA were compared by exhaustion with DNA, the immune pulse-labeled RNA obtained 48 hr after immunization displayed a slower exhaustion rate than normal RNA or RNA extracted 72 hr after immunization. These results suggest the temporary synthesis, at a higher frequency, of certain RNA sepcies 48 hr after immunization, as compared to the RNA synthesis in normal, nonimmune cells, or that occurring 72 hr after immunization. Thus, the three experimental approaches used lead to the conclusion that antigenic stimulation does not induce major gene amplification; it does, however, change the transcription rate of certain RNA species. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Low-viscosity perfluorcarbons were alumina-treated to remove polar impurities. On perfluorodecalin, perfluorodimethylcyclohexane, perfluorotrimethylcyclohexane, perfluoroethylcyclohexane, perfluorooctane, perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene, perfluoromethyladamantane, perfluorodimethyladamantane, the highly viscous perfluoropolyether liquids Krytox TLF7067 and 6354, and dimethylsiloxane liquids of a variety of viscosities, most cells did not attach; the few that did attach exhibited minimal spreading behavior and did not achieve the flattened spindle-shape morphology which is a prerequisite to normal proliferative activity. Conversely, on perfluoromethyldecaline, perfluorofluorene, perfluorotributylamine, the perfluoropolyether K-6 hexamer, trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane (fluorosilicone), and diphenyldimethylsiloxane, some cells became fusiform-shaped and exhibited proliferation, the extent of which varied with the compound. The association of alumina treatment of perfluorocarbon liquids with a reduction in cell growth was indicative of a relationship between the presence of residual hydrogen-containing impurities and the capacity for cellular attachment and growth. This correlation was demonstrated also in experiments in which cell attachment and growth was facilitated by the addition of hydrogen-rich monohydroperfluorooctane to alumina-treated perfluorooctane. In conclusion, evidence for the presence of surface active impurities in liquid vitreous substitute materials can be obtained by observing the behavior of attachment-dependent cells plated at the boundary between these compounds and culture medium. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Interpersonal awareness (IA) of smokers is defined as awareness of other people\\'s presence when smoking. Study participants were 1048 smokers and 744 nonsmokers, contrasted by worksite: office or production. Controlling for selected baseline variables, office work smokers, who smoked more in the workplace than production work smokers (77.4% vs 51.6%, p < .001), had a higher IA in the workplace (75.5% vs 58.9%, p < .001) but did not differ in IA at home (69.7% vs 66.0%). In male smokers of both worksites, degree of IA in the workplace correlated positively with that at home (rs = .36, p < .001, office; rs = .45, p < .001, production), and daily cigarette consumption correlated negatively with degree of IA at home (rs = -.44, p < .001, office; rs = -.17, p < .001, production). A predilection for smoking more at home than in the workplace correlated with higher IA in the workplace for male office smokers (rs = -.21, p < .01). In contrast, a predilection for smoking more at home than in the workplace correlated with lower degree of IA at home for production smokers of both sexes (rs = 20, p < .001, male; rs = .53, p < .05, female). Interpersonal awareness is deemed an important behavioral factor for smoking workers. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the effect of parenteral amino acid administration alone on human pancreatic secretion has not been studied. We have studied the short-term effect of parenteral administration of amino acids on pancreatic exocrine secretion in seven healthy men. A double-lumen tube was placed in the duodenum and polyethylene glycol was perfused into the proximal duodenum at the rate of 10 ml/min. A second double-lumen tube was placed in the stomach and bromsulfthalein was perfused into the cardia. Samples of duodenal contents were aspirated and gastric contents recovered during one hour of intravenous saline infusion followed by two hours of an amino acid mixture infusion. Hourly outputs of protein and pancreatic enzymes were determined, correcting for duodenogastric reflux based on concentrations of both markers in the samples. Despite an average increase of 72% in the plasma concentration of the infused amino acids, the outputs of protein, trypsin and amylase did not change significantly during amino acid infusion; the output of lipase decreased significantly during amino acid infusion. Two subjects were given intravenous secretin and cholecystokinin following amino acids; this resulted in increased outputs of protein, trypsin, and amylase in both. We conclude that the parenteral administration of amino acids to healthy young men does not stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion as measured by the method using duodenal marker perfusion at the rate of 10 ml/min. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The binding of [125I] hCG to follicular fluid is inhibited by unlabelled hCG, LH but not FSH, ACTH and GH. The binding of hormone to the receptor in follicular fluid is a saturable phenomenon and Scatchard analysis suggested that the receptor has high affinity to hCG with no changes as the follicle enlarges. In contrast, follicular fluid from large follicles (6-12 mm) has higher binding capacity (2.04 +/- 0.12 fmol/mg protein) than follicular fluid isolated from medium (3-5 mm) and small (1-2 mm) follicles (0.60 +/- 0.05 and 0.44 +/- 0.04 fmol/mg protein, respectively). With the aid of affinity chromatography on hCG-CNBr-Sepharose 6-B a homogeneous fraction with Mr about 65,000 as estimated by SDS-PAGE was isolated. Treatment of follicular fluid with several protein-modifying reagents changed interactions of [125I] hCG with both soluble receptor and that bound to granulosa cell membrane in the similar manner. The [125I] hCG binding capacity of follicular fluid represents about 9.5% of the total binding capacity of granulosa cells. Finally, soluble LH/hCG receptor is probably secreted actively by follicular cells into follicular fluid. Dead granulosa cells do not release receptor into follicular fluid or incubation medium. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Human fibroblasts were incubated with 200 microliters monocyte-conditioned medium, the 0.22 microns filtrate from cultured monocytes, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with controlled process serum replacement 2, a fetal calf serum substitute with low mitogenic activity. Increasing the numbers of fibroblasts resulted in a parallel increase in thymidine uptake to a maximal level. Fibroblasts (2 x 10(3] were plated into microwell plates and incubated with monocyte-conditioned medium for 72 hr. At 16 hr before harvest, 1 muCi [3H]thymidine was added. Cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline and washed, and the filters were counted. Fibroblasts incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and controlled process serum replacement 2 showed minimal thymidine uptake. Fibroblasts incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium plus monocyte-conditioned medium from monocytes stimulated with 10 micrograms/ml lipopolysaccharides showed a sixfold increase in thymidine uptake over fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and controlled process serum replacement 2 alone. Fibroblasts incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium plus monocyte-conditioned medium from monocytes of patients with liver disease (n = 20) showed a 10-fold elevation in thymidine uptake compared with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and controlled process serum replacement 2. Results indicated that preincubation of monocyte-conditioned medium with either anti-interleukin-1 beta (12.5 half-maximal units, 4 degrees C, 16 hr) or catalase (1,870 IU, 25 degrees C, 1 hr) did not alter the fibroproliferative activity of the monocyte-conditioned medium, suggesting that neither interleukin-1 beta nor activated oxygen intermediates were involved in fibroproliferation.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Groups of 12 male rats were assigned for 30 days to several types of environment: (a) large cage without stimulus objects, (b) large cage containing varied stimulus objects, (c) large cage containing a maze whose pattern of barriers was changed daily, and (d) a seminatural outdoor environment; in each experiment, littermates of rats in the social conditions were housed in isolation in small colony cages. At the end of the 30-day period, measures were taken of weights of brain regions, RNA and DNA contents of regions of cerebral cortex, and acetylcholinesterase activities of brain regions. Although the number of rats housed together was constant for conditions a--d and cage size was constant for conditions a--c, the magnitudes of the cerebral measures varied significantly as a function of the inanimate stimulus conditions. The differences from isola;ion-housed littermates was greatest in condition d and smallest in condition a. Thus, social grouping alone is inadequate to explain the cerebral effects of enriched environments and the inanimate stimulus conditions must be taken into account. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To isolate viruses from the upper respiratory tract, it is imperative that nasopharyngeal swabs are obtained from animals in the early acute stage of illness, i.e., during the pyrexic phase when the virus is replicating. Nasopharyngeal swabs must be placed in a virus transport medium and forwarded immediately to the laboratory at refrigerated temperature. Equine influenza, rhinopneumonitis, and equine viral arteritis are the three viral infections causing outbreaks of respiratory disease in North America. African horse sickness, although foreign to North America, could be introduced despite stringent horse importation regulations. Specific antiviral therapy is not available to treat viral respiratory disease in the horse. A variety of inactivated and modified live vaccines, however, are available to prevent clinical disease and the spread of infection caused by the common viral respiratory pathogens. A considerable amount of research is underway to enhance the potency and duration of immunity of the present vaccines against influenza and rhinopneumonitis. This research is directed at defining and characterizing the importance of specific glycoprotein antigens on the surface of the virus, which trigger the various host immune responses, and determining whether they are stimulatory or suppressive. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Some tumors expressed both or neither of these molecules. Among 9/13 ICAM-1+ tumors, in which greater than 50% cells reacted with the anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (LB-2), the class I antigen was also detected on greater than 50% of the cells. Only 2 ICAM-1+ tumors were class-I-. In 5/17 cases the tumors were MHC-class-I+ and ICAM-1-. Lymphocytes collected from the blood or from the tumor site were assayed for recognition on the tumor cells in the auto-tumor cytotoxicity test and in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC). Positive results were obtained only with the MHC-class-I+/ICAM-1+ tumors. In vitro treatment of the tumor cell suspensions with interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) induced or enhanced the ICAM-1 and/or class I antigen expression in 8/12 cases. Of the tumor samples treatged, 8/9 acquired stimulatory capacity and 3/10 became susceptible to lysis by the lymphocytes. In 6/6 MLTC performed with the cytokine-treated tumor cells, cytotoxicity against the autologous tumor was generated. Three of these MLTC lymphocytes also lysed the untreated targets. mAb directed to class I antigens or to ICAM-1 inhibited both the stimulation by and the lysis of tumor cells when confronted with fresh lymphocytes. The cytotoxicity generated in the MLTC was also inhibited. If, however, the cytotoxic function was induced in MTLC containing interleukin-2 (5 U/ml), inhibition was obtained only by pretreatment of the targets with mAb against ICAM-1. The results show thus (a) that the lymphocytes react in vitro with tumor cells only if these express both MHC class I molecules and ICAM-1; (b) that expression of these molecules can be induced by interferon alpha and TNF alpha; (c) that cytotoxic effectors generated in the MLTC with cytokine-treated tumors can also act on the untreated tumor cells. The requirement of the two surface moieties for the interaction with lymphocytes was also substantiated by blockade with relevant mAb. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Changes in platelet cyclic [3H]GMP and cyclic [3H]AMP were measured by rapid and sensitive prelabeling techniques, the validity of which were confirmed by radioimmunoassays. Incubation of the platelets with 0.1 to 10 microM SNP alone for 0.5 min caused progressively greater inhibitions of platelet function associated with large dose-dependent increases in cyclic [3H]GMP and 1.4- to 3.0-fold increases in cyclic [3H]AMP. However, addition of SNP with the adenylate cyclase activator, PGE1, at a concentration of the latter that had little effect alone, caused much larger increases in cyclic [3H]AMP and greatly enhanced the inhibition of platelet aggregation. SIN-1 had effects similar to those of SNP, although it was less active. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) diminished the increases in cyclic [3H]AMP caused by SNP or SIN-1 in both the presence and absence of PGE1 but reduced the inhibition of platelet function caused by the nitrovasodilators only in the presence of PGE1. These results suggest that, although cyclic GMP may mediate the inhibition of rabbit platelet function by high concentrations of nitrovasodilators added alone, the synergistic interaction of lower concentrations with PGE1 depends on an enhanced accumulation of cyclic AMP. Synergistic effects on cyclic [3H]AMP accumulation were also observed on incubation of platelets with SNP and adenosine, another activator of adenylate cyclase. Hemoglobin, which binds nitric oxide, blocked or reversed the increases in both cyclic [3H]GMP and cyclic [3H]AMP in platelets caused by the nitrovasodilators added either alone or with PGE1. Cilostamide, a selective inhibitor of platelet low Km cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, had effects on platelet cyclic [3H]AMP accumulation identical to those of SNP, suggesting that the action of the latter depends on inhibition of the same enzyme. M&B 22,948, a selective inhibitor of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, potentiated the increases in both cyclic [3H]GMP and cyclic [3H]AMP caused by SNP. A hyperbolic relationship was found between the increases in cyclic [3H]GMP and cyclic [3H]AMP caused by different concentrations of SNP; this relationship was not affected by addition of M&B 22,948. The results strongly suggest that the increases in platelet cyclic [3H]AMP caused by nitrovasodilators in the presence or absence of activators of adenylate cyclase are mediated by the inhibition by cyclic GMP of cyclic AMP breakdown.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

However, septic and hemorrhagic shock occur all too frequently, and each carries with it an appreciable morbidity and mortality. Endotoxins and hemorrhage are both known to suppress the phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). On the other hand, zymosan, a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell wall preparation administered intravenously, results in temporary RES hyperplasia and increased phagocytic activity. Dogs were pretreated with zymosan to determine the degree of RES stimulation and protection against endotoxin and hemorrhagic shock attainable. Twenty-five dogs received intravenous zymosan (10 mg/kg) on days 1, 2, and 3. Another 24 dogs served as controls. On day four, one-half the animals in each group received E coli endotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) intravenously. The other animals underwent two hours of hemorrhagic shock at a mean blood pressure of 40 mm Hg. Seventy-two hour survival was as follows: Endotoxin treated, 66.7% (8/12); endotoxin control, 27% (3/11); hemorrhagic treated, 53.3% (8/15); and hemorrhagic control, 28.6% (4/14). Hemodynamic, metabolic, and lysosomal enzyme parameters were evaluated. No zymosan toxicity was observed.

The two glycoproteins used as model acceptor substrates in this study were human asialotransferrin, which contains the nonreducing terminal oligosaccharide sequence Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man, and antifreeze glycoprotein, which contains oligosaccarides with the structure, Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc alph 1 leads O-Thr. Sequential action of the six glycosyltransferases on these model substrates led to the formation of previously described oligosaccharide structures. The studies reported here indicate that the substrate specificities of the individual enzymes dictate the structures that can be synthesized and the pathways by which they may be formed. The actions of a number of the transferasesare mutually exclusive, thereby prohibiting the formation of theoretically possible oligosaccharide structures. Oligosaccharides with the terminal sequence NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc cannot be formed because the prior incorporation of sialic acid by the sialyltransferases yields products that are not acceptor substrates for the fucosyltransferases, and vice versa. Synthesis of other products requires that the enzymes act sequentially in a specific order. The structures NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc, GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, and GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc can only be synthesized if the fucosyl alpha 1 leads to 2 galactose linkage is formed first. Synthesis of the pentasaccharide sequences GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GalNAc and GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc requires that the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase act last on the former structure and that the alpha 1 leads to 3 fucosyltransferase act last on the latter. In those instances where a product can be formed by one of two possible pathways, the comparisons of reaction rates indicate that one pathway is usually preferred... \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In a first experiment it was shown that the mean amplitudes of initial saccades from primary position to auditory targets were significantly affected by the simultaneous occurrence of a distracting visual stimulus. If both auditory and visual stimuli were in the same hemifield, the mean amplitude of initial saccades to a fixed buzzer position was consistently increased or decreased depending on the position of the visual stimulus. The phenomenon is felt to be analogous to the \"centre-of-gravity\" effect previously described for two simultaneous visual stimuli. It did not occur if visual and auditory stimuli were in opposite hemifields when a simultaneous visual stimulus caused a slight reduction of mean initial saccadic amplitude compared to the mean amplitude to buzzer alone. In this case the reduction was independent of visual stimulus position. Similar effects were seen for mean final eye positions. In a second experiment, a similar procedure was carried out, but the eyes started by looking at a point at 15 degrees eccentricity. The same pattern of auditory-visual interaction was obtained in both experiments, consistent with the concept of eye-movement related movement of modality-specific sensory \"maps\" which has recently been shown to occur in the superior colliculus of primates. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Following a 4-week placebo phase, 63 patients were randomly assigned to receive dilevalol and 65 to receive placebo. A titration phase followed during which the dose of dilevalol was increased every other week from 100 mg to 800 mg to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) less than 90 mm Hg and decreased by 10 mm Hg or more from baseline. A matching number of placebo capsules for each dose level of dilevalol was dispensed for blinding purposes. Patients who had at least a 5 mm Hg reduction in SDBP entered a 1-month maintenance phase. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured weekly 20 to 24 hours after a dose. This study demonstrated that the minimally effective dose of dilevalol was 100 mg, which was shown to result in a significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater reduction in systolic BP. A once-daily dose of 200 mg was superior to placebo in both systolic and diastolic BP effects (P less than 0.001 and less than 0.001, respectively), and this superiority was seen again at both the end of titration and the end of the study. The BP reduction was accompanied by a small (5 bpm) decrease in heart rate. The side effect profile of dilevalol was not different from placebo. Dilevalol appears to have no adverse effect on plasma lipids.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Mean age was 56.8 years in the group in which this artery was used and 61.8 years in the group in which it was not (p less than 0.001). All other preoperative characteristics including number of women, extent of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and preoperative left ventricular function were not significantly different between the two groups. An internal mammary artery graft was concomitantly used in 68 patients (97%) of the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in 61 patients (87%) without such a graft. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3.3 and 3.4, aortic crossclamp time was 65.3 +/- 19.9 minutes and 54.0 +/- 20.1 minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 114.8 +/- 23.6 minutes and 112.9 +/- 25.0 minutes, respectively, in the groups with and without a gastroepiploic artery graft. Only aortic crossclamp time was significantly (p less than 0.05) longer in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft. There were two (2.9%) early deaths and two (2.9%) new Q-wave infarctions in both groups. Intraaortic balloon pumping was required in five patients (7.1%) in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in three patients (4.3%) without this graft. Postoperative complications were similar and rare in both groups. Intraoperative endoscopic laser Doppler study demonstrated no significant change of gastric mucosal blood flow before and after division of the gastroepiploic artery. We concluded that there is no additional risk in the use of the gastroepiploic artery for coronary bypass grafting, and a favorable outcome can be expected. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Participants, recruited by population-based screening of 158,906 people aged 30 to 69 years in 14 communities througout the United States, were randomly assigned to SC or RC groups within each center and by entry diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (90 to 104, 105 to 114, and 115 + mm Hg). Over the five years of the study, more than two thirds of the SC participants continued to receive medication, and more than 50% achieved BP levels within the normotensive range, at or below the HDFP goal for DBP. Controls of BP was consistently better for the SC than for the RC group. Five-year mortality from all causes was 17% lower for the SC group compared to the RC group (6.4 vs 7.7 per 100, P less than .01) and 20% lower for the SC subgroup with entry DBP of 90 to 104 mm Hg compared to the corresponding RC subgroup (5.9 vs 7.4 per 100, P less than .01). These findings of the HDFP indicate that the systematic effective management of hypertension has a great potential for reducing mortality for the large numbers of people with high BP in the population, including those with \"mild\" hypertension. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A total of 619 male and female residents of Los Angeles County who were diagnosed with NHL between January 1, 1979, and June 30, 1982, were compared to individually age-, race-, and sex-matched neighborhood controls with regard to history of use of 49 different medications, 47 chronic and infectious diseases or other conditions, 15 types of immunizations, and 15 specific allergic reactions. Based on preliminary analyses, long-term regular use of aspirin and other pain relievers and greater than or equal to 2 mo of treatment with penicillin and other antibiotics were associated with significantly increased risk of NHL. Other drugs associated with greater risk of NHL were use of digitalis and estrogen replacement therapy by women, use of corticosteroids, and greater than or equal to 2 mo of use of tranquilizers. NHL was strongly associated with a prior history of cancer. Cases more frequently reported histories of kidney infections and anemia than did controls; a history of eczema appeared to be protective against NHL. Women who had been immunized against polio by injectable vaccine were at significantly lower risk of NHL than women who had not received this immunization. Among men, cholera immunization and allergy to nuts and berries were significantly protective. Subjects who had received a yellow fever immunization also had lower NHL risk. Further analyses of these data will attempt to establish the relative importance of these potential risk factors and to determine whether any are markers of early symptoms of NHL. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Firstly, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive Wistar Kyoto controls (WKY) were submitted to ether stress. Plasma concentrations of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EI), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH) were measured by radioimmunoassay. The basal concentration of beta-EI was similar in WKY and SHR, whereas WKY had higher levels of ACTH and lower levels of alpha-MSH than SHR. In both strains acute stress enhanced the plasma concentration of beta-EI to the same extent and with a similar time-course. The increase of plasma beta-EI coincided with a rise in ACTH but not alpha-MSH. Gel chromatography of beta-EI revealed that plasma extracts contain similar amounts of beta-lipotropin- (beta-LPH) and beta-E-sized immunoreactive components, and that acute stress elevated both forms of beta-EI. Secondly, isolated tail arteries of SHR and WKY were perfused and field stimulated with two pulses at 1 Hz. beta-E depressed stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction with the same potency in both strains. Thus, basal and stress-induced levels of beta-EI did not differ in SHR and WKY. Moreover, in the tail artery of both strains the sensitivity of presynaptic opioid receptors towards beta-E was almost identical. If the beta-E sensitivity of these receptors in other arteries of WKY and SHR is also similar a major role of the circulating peptide in the development of hypertension is rather unlikely. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Here, we determined if (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydroxy-5h-dibenzo (a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK 801) could attenuate behavioral deficits associated with early radiation-induced hypoplasia of fascia dentata granule cells. We pretreated neonatal rats (n = 20) with MK 801 (0, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg, IP) before each of eight fractionated, head-only doses of X-rays (13 Gy total) administered during the first 16 days postpartum. Other rats (n = 18) received the same drug treatments but were sham irradiated. At age 16 months, water-escape latencies to a submerged platform were measured in a water maze. Irradiated rats with hippocampal damage exhibited impaired learning (longer latencies to find the platform) than did sham-irradiated subjects. Moderate doses of MK 801 (0.1 mg/kg) facilitated the learning of the water maze by irradiated subjects but did not enhance the number of their fascia dentata granule cells. Higher doses (0.2 mg/kg) of MK 801 provided no behavioral benefits. In fact, this dose significantly impaired the learning of the water maze by sham-irradiated rats and potentiated the granule cell hypoplasia observed in irradiated subjects. Thus, early MK 801 treatment produces dose-dependent behavioral protection for rats with radiation-induced hippocampal damage. Future studies may reveal the neurophysiological and neuroanatomic substrates of this behavioral recovery. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Such an analysis should take into account the natural physical and socio-geographical conditions as well as basic data relating to the population living in a particular area and its movement. A further step is the topographical determination of available data on chronic diseases and handicaps in the individual discernable areas; besides the various statistical data, one should investigate also the degree of severity and the care required by the individual forms of diseases or handicaps. These factors largely influence the needs in the fields of medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation for in-patient or out-patient facilities and the personnel requirements in the form of specialist staff. When performing such calculations, it is often necessary to find a compromise between the various alternatives in accordance with the corresponding, existing socio-political and national health system. On the basis of such data, it is possible to formulate a concrete single plan together with already functioning institutions; such a plan could take its lead from a model concept. Of assistance, in this case, would be an epidemiological assessment which , in a longitudinal section of time, can transform itself into interventionist research and improvement of the deficiencies thereby ascertained. Consideration should also be paid to allowing future actions to be accompanied by scientific measures. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The P300 cerebral event-related potential is an electrophysiological correlate of cognitive decision-making processes that can be measured in response to either an auditory or visual stimulus. P300 and reaction time (RT) were recorded from a visual stimulus under euglycemic conditions and at plasma glucose concentrations of 3.3 and 2.6 mM during insulin infusion in 10 subjects. Reducing plasma glucose levels to 3.3 mM was not associated with an increase in either the latency or amplitude of the P300 component or a change in RT. However, further lowering of plasma glucose to 2.6 mM resulted in an increase in the latency of P300 and a prolongation in RT. Similar changes were seen for the auditory P300 in experiments performed on 9 additional subjects in which both auditory and visual stimuli were presented. The prolongation of P300 did not correct immediately when plasma glucose was raised to basal levels with intravenous glucose but returned to normal 45-75 min later, after ingestion of a carbohydrate-containing meal. Analysis of another event-related potential, P140 (a measure of the sensory processes), showed no change in response to hypoglycemia. Prolongation of RT paralleled the prolongation of P300 latency, suggesting that motor processes were not altered. Therefore, hypoglycemia appears to induce abnormalities in decision-making processes.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The present study was performed to investigate the effect of electrolytic lesions in the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region or in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) on the pressor and bradycardic responses induced by central clonidine in rats. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded in sham or AV3V-lesioned rats with cerebral stainless steel cannulae implanted into the lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) or LH, and in sham or bilateral LH-lesioned rats with cannulae-implanted ICV. The injection of clonidine (40 nmol) ICV or into the LH of sham rats produced a pressor response (37 +/- 2-48 +/- 3 mmHg) and bradycardia (-45 +/- 10- -93 +/- 6 bpm). After AV3V-lesion (3 and 12 days) or LH-lesion (3 days) the pressor response was abolished and a small hypotensive response was induced by the injection of clonidine (-1 +/- 3- -16 +/- 3 mmHg). The bradycardia (-27 +/- 6- -57 +/- 11 bpm) was reduced, but not abolished by the lesions. These results show that the AV3V region and LH are important cerebral structures that participate in the excitatory pathways involved in the pressor response to central clonidine in rats. They also suggest that, in the absence of these pressor pathways, the hypotensive responses to central clonidine may appear in conscious rats. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Morphine inhibits the adenylate cyclase activity in NG108-15 cells and causes increases in adenylate cyclase synthesis and the down-regulation of opiate receptors in cells treated for several days. Chronic exposure of NG108-15 cells to ethanol also causes a decrease in the mRNA of the GTP-binding protein (Gs). These observations suggest the possibility that a group of genes is expressed in response to morphine or ethanol during the acquisition of tolerance and dependence. Recently, it has been reported that cAMP regulates a number of genes through a cAMP response element (CRE) in their promotor regions and that nuclear CRE-binding proteins bind specifically to the CRE to stimulate the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes. The gel shift assay with a single stranded oligo-DNA of CRE in a somatostatin promotor region was employed to examine the possibility of transcriptional regulation of cAMP-inducible genes by chronic morphine or ethanol treatment of NG108-15 cells. When the nuclear proteins from the cells treated with morphine or ethanol for several days were provided for the assay, the amounts of DNA-protein complex were decreased. The decreased complexes were recovered by 1-2 days after morphine withdrawal. The nuclear proteins were purified partially by a combination of chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300 and DNA affinity-Sepharose. Changes in CRE-binding proteins from the cells treated chronically with morphine or ethanol suggest that these drugs can modulate the expression of cAMP-inducible genes through which tolerance and dependence may develop. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The punctate layer is composed of long, tapered cylindrical units centered on p6 symmetry axes and connected by six fine linking arms, joining at the axis of threefold symmetry to create a hexagonal layer with a lattice constant of 25.6 +/- 0.5 nm (J. A. Chapman, R. G. E. Murray, and M. R. J. Salton, Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 158:498-513, 1963; R. G. E. Murray, Can. J. Microbiol. 9:593-600, 1963). Extraction of cell envelopes with 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8) containing 2% deoxycholate resulted in the release of several proteins, but left the S layers intact. The punctate layer was then extracted with 3 M guanidine hydrochloride or 6 M urea, leaving the perforate layer intact. This treatment led to the release of three polypeptides with molecular weights of 60,000, 66,000, and 240,000 (60K, 66K, and 240K polypeptides). These three polypeptides reassembled on the perforate layer as a template to form the S-layer complex or self-assembled to form the punctate layer alone after dialysis of the extract against 50 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM CaCl2. The self-assemblies were composed of a 240K polypeptide and a 60K polypeptide. The 240K and 60K polypeptides were separated by column chromatography and examined by electron microscopy. The 240K polypeptide appeared in negative stain as a long, flexible structure and assembled into loose arrays with sixfold symmetry with obvious Y-shaped linking elements, while fractions containing both the 60K and 240K polypeptides showed assemblies closely resembling the punctuate layer. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to confirm the presence of both the 60K and 240K polypeptides as components of the punctuate layer. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The hypothesis holds that dissipative and elastic processes within lung tissue are coupled at the level of the stress-bearing element. Such a description leads naturally to consideration of a readily measured attribute of organ-level dissipative behavior called lung tissue hysteresivity, eta. On preliminary analysis this attribute is found to be nearly frequency independent and numerically conserved across species. To the degree that the numerical value of eta might be conserved during an intervention in which tissue dynamic elastance changes, such behavior would be consistent with the notion that elastic energy storage and dissipative energy loss reside within the very same stress-bearing element and, moreover, that those processes within the stress-bearing element bear an approximately fixed relationship. Tissue hysteresivity is closely related to the parameter K used by Bachofen and Hildebrandt (J. Appl. Physiol. 30: 493-497, 1971) to describe energy dissipation per cycle, and both lend themselves directly to interpretation based on processes ongoing at the levels of microstructure and molecule. Intraparenchymal connective tissues, surface film, and contractile elements appear to submit individually to this description and, in doing so, yield respective hysteresivities that are relatively well matched; this suggests that such hysteretic matching may be a necessary condition for synchronous expansion of the alveolar duct. The overriding simplicity with which this description organizes diverse observations implies that it may capture some unifying attribute of underlying mechanism. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Hepatic sphingosine and sphinganine levels in affected mice (593 pmol/mg protein) were elevated more than 20-fold when compared to levels in age-matched normal mice (26 pmol/mg protein). Upon fractionation of mutant liver homogenates by differential centrifugation, most of the sphingoid bases sedimented with beta-hexosaminidase in the 9000 x g pellet. Co-sedimentation of sphingoid bases with a lighter beta-hexosaminidase peak in Percoll gradients suggests that these bases accumulate in lipid laden lysosomes. A cytosolic sphinganine kinase is the first enzyme in the degradative pathway of sphingoid base metabolism. Activity of this enzyme was partially deficient in crude mutant liver cytosolic extracts due to the presence of an inhibitory substance. Following molecular sieving of mutant cytosolic extracts on Sepharose 4B, sphinganine kinase, with normal levels of activity, was resolved from a complex higher-molecular-weight inhibitor fraction. The Km values for either sphinganine or ATP-Mg substrates with partially purified sphinganine kinase from normal and mutant mouse liver extracts, were similar. These findings indicate that accumulation of free sphingoid bases is not due to a direct inherent deficiency in the catalytic activity of sphinganine kinase. The possible cause and effect relationship between the accumulation of these endogenous hydrophobic amines and the lesion in intracellular cholesterol trafficking in Niemann-Pick type C disease is discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Based upon intake of calcium and phosphorus cooperating herds were grouped as feeding: 1) greater than .53% of the total ration dry matter as calcium and greater than .28% as phosphorus: 2) less than .47% as calcium and greater than .28% as phosphorus; 3) greater than .47% to less than .53% as calcium and greater than .22% to less than .28% as phosphorus. Injections of vitamin D3 given approximately 1 wk prepartum reduced incidence of milk fever in cows with previous history of milk fever in all three groups but had no effect in cows with no previous milk fever. Incidence of milk fever was lower in group 3 than for cows of groups 1 and 2 with previous milk fever and than for cows of group 1 with no previous history. The results indicate that careful control of calcium and phosphorus intake during the dry period at .5% calcium and .25% phosphorus of the dry matter of the total ration will limit milk fever incidence to about 10%.

This process involves the clustering of the integral membrane protein band 3 by denatured haemoglobin and the subsequent recognition of the exofacial poles of clustered band 3 and associated proteins by autologous antibodies. To determine whether this clearance pathway might mediate normal cell turnover, the fraction of normal erythrocytes containing the 0.5% densest cells, which are known to be destined for immediate removal, was isolated and characterized biochemically. This densest fraction was found to contain 6 times more membrane-bound globin (haemichromes) and 10 times more surface-bound autologous IgG than the other fractions containing cells of lower density. To determine whether the autologous IgG was physically associated with the haemichrome-stabilized membrane protein clusters, a procedure was developed for isolation and characterization of the microscopic aggregates. The isolated aggregates were found to contain a disulphide-cross-linked mixture of several membrane proteins, predominantly haemichromes, spectrin and band 3. Although the aggregates constituted only 0.09% of the total membrane protein, they still contained approximately 55% of the total cell-surface IgG. Since in control studies anti-(blood group A) antibodies, which are distributed randomly over the surface of type A cells, could not be recovered in the aggregate, we conclude that the autologous cell-surface IgGs were physically associated with the membrane protein clusters when they were co-isolated with them in our procedure. Thus the 640-fold enrichment of autologous IgG in the aggregates compared with regions of the membrane devoid of tightly clustered protein suggests that sites of integral protein clustering either are non-specifically sticky to IgG or are viewed as foreign or 'non-self' by the immune system and aggressively opsonized with IgG. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Growth and endocrine parameters in the offspring of SRIF immunized (SI) and control (C) crossbred ewes were examined. Lamb weight was recorded at birth and twice each week to 24 days of age. Blood samples were collected prior to first suckle and twice each week. At 21 to 24 days of age, in separate experiments, lambs were infused with glucose (0.29 g/kg), arginine (0.25 g/kg) or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 0.33 microgram/kg). A strong correlation (R = 0.88; P less than .01) was observed between anti-SRIF titre in the ewe at parturition and in the lamb at 3 days of age. No effect on lamb birth weight (SI 4.28 +/- 0.27 kg; C 4.35 +/- 0.23 kg) was observed. At 24 days of age cumulative gain in SI lambs (5.4 +/- 0.32 kg) was greater (P less than .05) than in C lambs (4.5 +/- 0.32 kg). The growth hormone secretory responses to glucose or arginine were not affected by treatment. Plasma IGF-I, plasma thyroxine (T4) and the plasma thyrotropin and T4 responses to TRH were not different between treatments. Plasma triiodothyronine (T3) was higher (P less than .05) in SI (2.46 +/- .10 ng/ml) than in C (2.01 +/- .05 ng/ml) lambs, however, the plasma T3 response to TRH was lower in SI lambs. Plasma glucose (mg/dl) was higher (P less than .05) in SI (118.4 +/- 1.7) than in C (106.0 +/- 4.0) lambs. Plasma insulin was not affected by treatment. Increased plasma T3 and glucose concentrations during SRIF immunoneutralization in the neonate lamb may be important factors contributing to the growth response observed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The larger Type-I males (unlike Type-II males and females) build nests, guard eggs, and generate several types of vocalizations. Sound production by Type-I males is paralleled by a proportionate increase of 600% in their sonic muscle mass. The motor volley from ventral occipital roots innervating the sonic muscles establishes their contraction rate and, in turn, the fundamental frequency of emitted sounds. Electrical stimulation of the midbrain in every male and female elicited a rhythmic sonic discharge as recorded in the occipital roots; however, the fundamental frequency was slightly, but significantly, higher (20%) in Type-I males. Intracellular recording from identified motoneurons and presumed presynaptic \"pacemaker\" neurons showed their synaptic and action potentials had the same frequency as that of the nerve volley in every male and female. Reconstructions of physiologically identified motoneurons and pacemaker neurons following intracellular horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) filling showed their somata and dendrites to be 100-300% larger in Type-I males. These data unambiguously show that the size of a target muscle is correlated with the size of both the respective motoneurons and their presynaptic afferent neurons. As discussed, this implies that the dramatic increase in neuron size in the sonic motor system of Type-I males is causally dependent upon expansion of the sonic muscle. It is further likely that the more modest sex difference in the rhythmic central discharge is established by the intrinsic membrane properties of sonic neurons. These results also corroborate, at a number of behavioral, morphological, and neurophysiological levels, that the sonic motor system of \"sneak spawning\" Type-II males is similar to that of females. Thus, unlike the vocalizing Type-I males, sexual differentiation of the reproductive system in Type-II males is not linked to concomitant changes in the neurophysiological and morphological features of the sonic motor circuit. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This lag-free temperature-sensitive process is correlated with a conversion of the lipophilic proteoglycans of the cell surface into non-lipophilic proteoglycans that accumulate in the culture medium. The released proteoglycans are very similar to their lipophilic precursors in size, buoyant density and glycosaminoglycan characteristics; however, they exhibit slightly smaller core proteins after chemical and enzymic deglycosylation. The lipophilicity of the larger-sized core proteins of the cell-associated proteoglycans is also correlated with the presence of an easily iodinatable domain; this domain is missing in the released proteoglycans. Exogenous proteases (i.e. chymotrypsin, V8, trypsin and proteinase K) readily cleave this segment from the larger protease-resistant region of the proteoglycan structure. It is also released intact by treatment of the isolated proteoglycans with methanolic HCl. This component appears to be peptide in character, in that proteases readily degrade it and release iodotyrosines when the precursor has been iodinated. No evidence for the presence of covalently attached fatty acids in the cell-associated proteoglycans was found. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the altered proteoglycan metabolism that is associated with the phorbol-ester-induced terminal differentiation of certain human colon cancer cells ensues upon the activation of a membrane-localized protease that cleaves a lipophilic anchor segment from the cell surface proteoglycans. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The infusion studies on FK, 5.0 mg kg-1 through the portal and femoral veins showed that the mean hepatic extraction ratio of FK was 27.9 per cent. The effect of clamping both the hepatic artery and the portal vein on the plasma disappearance profiles of FK, 5.0 mg kg-1, and CyA, 3.5 mg kg-1 was studied. The plasma disposition kinetics of CyA was almost the same as in the normal rats. However, the plasma FK levels were about 10 times higher than those obtained in the control group rats. This difference is attributed to the restricted initial distribution of FK to the liver, because the volume of the initial distribution space, V1, of FK was about 10 times smaller than that obtained in normal rats. In in vitro experiments, drug distribution was studied in blood samples (2.0 ml) spiked with FK or CyA, 1.0 micrograms ml-1. The plasma drug levels measured at 2 min after drug administration were 0.842 +/- 0.012 micrograms ml-1 and 0.769 +/- 0.047 micrograms ml-1 for FK and CyA, respectively. The distribution volume in the blood compartment, VB, was determined by dividing the spiked amount of drugs with these plasma concentrations. The VB was 2.38 +/- 0.04 ml for FK and 2.62 +/- 0.16 ml for CyA. There was no significant difference in VB between FK and CyA. The plasma free fraction, fp of the drugs was measured by the equilibrium dialysis method. For FK, the mean fp values (+/- SE) were 1.31 +/- 0.18 per cent (2.0 micrograms ml-1) and 1.93 +/- 0.18 per cent (5.0 micrograms ml-1). For CyA, the fp values were 4.85 +/- 0.36 per cent (1.0 micrograms ml-1) and 5.75 +/- 0.82 per cent (5.0 micrograms ml-1). The hydrophobicity parameter, logP' determined through the HPLC method was 0.386 for FK and 0.545 for CyA. Although FK was less hydrophobic than CyA, its protein binding was higher than CyA. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Substrate movements in forearm muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue were studied, by measurement of arteriovenous differences and blood flow, in seven normal subjects after an overnight fast and then for 6 h after ingestion of a mixed meal. Overall substrate balances were examined in terms of the flux of gram-atoms of carbon. 2. As found previously, the forearm was approximately in carbon balance (import equal to export) after the overnight fast, whereas adipose tissue was a net exporter of carbon, mainly in the form of non-esterified fatty acids. 3. After the meal, arterialized plasma concentrations of glucose and lactate rose sharply (peak at 60 min), whereas those of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol fell (nadir at 60-120 min). Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations rose slowly to peak at 240 min;much of this rise was accounted for by a rise in the chylomicron fraction. 4. Both tissues took up glucose at an increased rate after the meal. Release of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue was suppressed. Clearance of triacylglycerol by both tissues increased after the meal, but was more marked in adipose tissue, where the fractional extraction of chylomicron-triacylglycerol reached 44% at 240 min. 5. The forearm rapidly became a considerable net importer of carbon, and remained so until 6 h after the meal when it was again in approximate carbon balance. Glucose uptake dominated the forearm carbon balance. Adipose tissue was a net importer of carbon from 30 min until 5 h after the meal and then reverted to net export. Clearance of triacylglycerol carbon made the largest contribution to this positive balance, but towards the end of the study this was increasingly counterbalanced by simultaneous non-esterified fatty acid release. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This paper reports the effects of the administration of 90Sr on spermatogenesis in the male littermates of these female mice. Doses of 370 and 740 kBq 90Sr administered to the dam at day 19 of gestation were found to cause a transient retardation in the appearance of more advanced types of germ cells in the testis. In comparison with the control testes, in the 90Sr treated mice less tubular cross-sections showed spermatocytes or round spermatids at days 14 and 2i p.p., respectively. After 56 days, spermatogenesis in the 90Sr treated mice was similar to that in control mice. Doses of 92.5 and 185 kBq 90Sr had no visible effect. It is concluded that the foetal testis is much less vulnerable to the damaging effects of 90Sr administration than the ovary, in which a dose of 92.5 kBq permanently decreased germ cell numbers to 40 per cent of the control numbers. Nevertheless, presumably also in the foetal testis, many germ cell will be killed by the radiation from the 90Sr. However, in the testis the surviving stem cells apparently quickly restore their numbers at the cost of a delay in the production of differentiating cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Rats (n = 8) were fed hypocalorically for 10 days, resulting in a 33.5 +/- 3.0% (SE) reduction in body weight. The fatigue resistance of muscles was assessed with use of isolated soleus muscles at a temperature of 25 degrees C. Fatigue resistance was determined from the decline in isometric force during a series of tetanic contractions. Two contrasting contraction protocols were devised to test the susceptibility of muscles to fatigue. One protocol was designed to require high rates of energy supply and hence force a dependence on glycolytic energy supply pathways. The second protocol required much lower rates of energy supply that could be entirely met by oxidative energy supply processes. During the high energy demand (glycolytic) protocol, the force produced by muscles from a control group of rats decreased to 78.7 +/- 0.8% (n = 12 muscles) of the initial value. Hypocaloric feeding significantly reduced the resistance of muscles to fatigue: force declined to 61.3 +/- 3.5% (n = 16 muscles) during the contraction protocol. In contrast, when fatigue was quantified using the low energy demand (oxidative) contraction protocol, the effect of nutritional status on fatigue resistance was entirely abolished. This result supports the hypothesis that resistance to fatigue is critically dependent on the fatigue test employed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Acidic extracts of human placental tissue collected at term pregnancy contained high irNPY concentrations. The extracted irNPY eluted from HPLC with the same retention time as synthetic NPY. The presence of the peptide in placental cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical findings showing numerous cells of the cytotrophoblast layer positively staining for NPY. Further supporting local production of the peptide, primary cultures of human placental cells released irNPY into the culture medium and the addition of high K+ concentrations increased the release of the peptide. The finding of irNPY in human placenta stimulated the characterization of binding sites of NPY in the same tissue. Using autoradiographic techniques we showed specific binding of [125I]NPY in human placental tissue. The binding of [125I]NPY to the placental receptors was saturable and widely distributed within the placental tissue. Finally, the addition of NPY to the medium of cultured placental cells increased the release of immunoreactive CRF, suggesting a possible role of NPY in placental hormone production. The effect of NPY was dose related and augmented by the addition of norepinephrine (10 nM). These results showed that human placenta produces and secretes irNPY and that NPY receptors are present in placental tissue. Moreover, the evidence that NPY stimulated the release of immunoreactive CRF from cultured placental cells suggests an action of NPY in placental hormonogenesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The VPS3 gene, which was cloned using a novel selection procedure, encodes a low abundance, hydrophilic protein of 117 kD that most likely resides in the cytoplasm. Yeast strains bearing a deletion of the VPS3 gene (vps3-delta 1) are viable, yet their growth rate is significantly reduced relative to wild-type cells. Temperature shift experiments with strains carrying a temperature conditional vps3 allele demonstrate that cells rapidly lose the capacity to sort the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon loss of VPS3 function. Vacuolar morphology was examined in wild-type and vps3-delta 1 yeast strains by fluorescence microscopy. The vacuoles in wild-type yeast cells are morphologically complex, and they appear to be actively partitioned between mother cells and buds during an early phase of bud growth. Vacuolar morphology in vps3-delta 1 mutants is significantly altered from the wild-type pattern, and the vacuolar segregation process seen in wild-type strains is defective in these mutants. With the exception of a vacuolar acidification defect, the phenotypes of vps3-delta 1 strains are significantly different from those of mutants lacking the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase. These data demonstrate that the acidification defect in vps3-delta 1 cells is not the primary cause of the pleiotropic defects in vacuolar function observed in these mutants. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Genetic evidence suggests that FirA plays a role in transcription since certain firA alleles confer temperature sensitivity for growth and RNA synthesis as well as reversing the rifampin resistance of rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants ('fir' effect). FirA co-immunoprecipitates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme, implying a physical association with the transcriptional machinery, possibly with the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. FirA contains a previously undescribed isoleucine/valine-rich six-amino-acid repeat occurring 14 times within the N-terminal and 12 more times within the C-terminal half of the protein. This repeat can be formulated as [HXXXhZ]n with 'H' representing a large non-polar residue (usually isoleucine), 'h' representing a smaller non-polar residue, 'Z' representing either charged/polar or aromatic residues, XXX representing residues typical of beta turns, and 'n' being equal to the repeat number. We refer to this repeat as an isoleucine patch. Proteins encoded by three E. coli acyltransferases also contain this motif which is roughly positioned in each case, within the amino- and carboxyl termini, as in FirA. When the sequences of these proteins are aligned, a region of poor similarity separates the isoleucine patches. The significance of these repeats remains unknown although we speculate that they play an important structural role in the organization and function of FirA (and other proteins containing isoleucine patches), possibly by acting as homo- or hetero-dimerization interfaces.\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Graphical representation of data in this manner is important for statistical analysis. In particular, graphical representation may be used to display confidence regions about a mean power, for example. A disadvantage of these representations, however, is that simply changing the reference meridian for cylinder axes changes distances in the space and, therefore, changes the shapes of the confidence regions. Because the shapes define the nature of the variation and give, in particular, the principal components of variation, a researcher who happens to measure the orientation of cylinder axes from the 20 degree meridian, for example, instead of the conventional horizontal meridian, could be led to different statistical conclusions. The implication is that such conclusions are unlikely to have much physical meaning. A representation is described here in which distances and shapes do not depend on the meridian that happens to be chosen as reference. Each dioptric power is represented by a point in Euclidean 3-space. Several examples of graphical representation are given. The spherical powers occupy a particular line in the space, the Jackson crossed cylinders occupy a plane, the cylindrical powers occupy a cone, and so on, for all types of conventional dioptric power. These lines and surfaces are illustrated. The statistical implications are discussed briefly. The representation satisfies the requirements of the statistics and is proposed as the standard one for future use. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In 7 cases, a pterional approach was associated to one of these combined procedures. A classification is proposed, based on the tumour extension along the anteroposterior axis: I) anterior to the crista galli; II) anterior to the anterior clinoÃ¯d process; III) posterior to the anterior clinoÃ¯d process; and along the vertical axis A: below the bone level; B: below the dura level; C: at and above the dura level. This classification appears very useful to choose among the surgical procedures which one is the more appropriate. In type A tumour (N = 8), TF is sufficient while in type B (N = 38) and C (N = 32) a cranial route is always necessary; among the latter, a combined procedure is frequently asked for posterior tumours type II (N = 29) and III (N = 24). However, others parameters such as tumour consistency, vascularization and need for en-bloc removal are also relevant in this choice. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The multidermatomal intercostal technique is one such approach, although the anatomical mechanism of this nerve block is a matter of debate. At our pain clinic, we have used another technique, a modification of the paravertebral block, to achieve multiple segments of unilateral sensory blockade. We have used this technique, which we call the paravertebral-peridural block, for over 20 years in the treatment of various pain problems. In retrospective analysis of the 384 blocks performed from 1982 to 1986, there was one pneumothorax (0.26%), one thecal puncture (0.26%), and two accidental intrathecal injections (0.52%). Eighteen blocks (4.6%) resulted in transient hypotension. There were no permanent sequelae. Ninety-three percent of blocks were evaluated as \"good\" or \"excellent\" in quality. Bilateral sensory blockade was documented in five patients (1.3%). In order to clarify the mechanism of bilateral blockade resulting from a unilateral technique, we injected four fresh cadavers with colored latex solution using the paravertebral-peridural approach. This revealed spread of the latex across the midline prevertebrally to the contralateral paravertebral space. We conclude that the paravertebral-peridural thoracic block is a reliable, safe technique for achieving unilateral anesthesia over multiple dermatomes with a single injection. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Fibronectin mediates attachment and spreading of the corneal epithelial cells. However, it seems to be important to know the changes in cellular receptor activity in order to understand the interactions of corneal epithelial cells and underlying extracellular matrix. In this investigation, we studied the effects of various culture times and conditions on the receptor activity of rabbit corneal epithelial cells for fibronectin. The cultured cells were placed on tissue culture plates that were coated with various concentrations of four extracellular matrices: fibronectin, laminin and collagen types I and IV. Freshly isolated corneal epithelial cells without culture did not spread on fibronectin and laminin; they spread only on collagen types I and IV. When the epithelial cells were cultured for 12 h or more, they spread on fibronectin. However, the spreading of the cells on collagen types I and IV was the same regardless of the culture period (up to 20 h). Only a small number of epithelial cells spread on laminin at the highest concentration examined after culture for 12 h or more. Thus, the corneal epithelial cells responded differently to fibronectin, collagen types I and IV, and laminin. Perhaps the receptor for fibronectin appears when epithelial cells are cultured, but the receptor(s) for collagen types I and IV are always present on the cell surface of corneal epithelial cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This makes it particularly suitable for use in light guiding systems. In this study laser light scattering spectroscopy was assessed for its ability to provide information on the motility of respiratory cilia. In vitro and in vivo measurements were undertaken with animal tracheal mucosa. The intensity fluctuations of laser light scattered from moving cilia were analysed in terms of their autocorrelation functions to provide information on the frequency and synchrony of beating cilia. In vitro measurements were performed on fresh bovine trachea to estimate a safe laser power level for mucosal exposure and to test the method by defining the temperature dependence of the ciliary beat frequency. Power densities not exceeding 0.3 kW/cm2 were found to be the upper limit for long term exposure of the mucosa in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency showed a pronounced temperature dependence, ranging from 5.8 to 28.3 Hz over the temperature range 20-43.5 degrees C. A maximum frequency was found at 41.5 degrees C. In vivo measurements of ciliary activity were performed in six pigs by means of optical fibres for light transmission combined with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. A ciliary beat frequency of 5 Hz was obtained; heart and breathing frequencies could be separated and identified. These results suggest that laser light scattering spectroscopy might provide a convenient method of studying the mucociliary system of the lower airways. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The children were divided into three groups: Group I, history of sexual contact and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Group II, no history of sexual contact but at risk; and Group III, nonabused. A vaginal introital transverse diameter of greater than 4 mm was more prevalent among children in Group I (94%) than in Group II, (5%); or in Group III (0%) (chi 2, p less than .001). Eighty-eight percent of children who complained of penile-vaginal penetration had a vaginal introital diameter greater than 4 mm as compared to 18% of children with no penetration (chi 2, p less than .001). Forty-six percent of children who complained of fondling with penetration had a vaginal introital diameter of greater than 4 mm as compared to 14% in those without a history of penetration (chi 2, p less than .008). Fifty-eight percent of children with more than one encounter had a vaginal introital diameter greater than 4 mm as compared to 29% in those with one encounter (chi 2, p less than .006). In a logarithmic regression analysis, the greatest proportion of children with a vaginal introital diameter greater than 4 mm was observed in the penile-vaginal contact group (chi 2, p less than .00003).

Utilizing a polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding murine sTnC. The 160-amino acid sTnC protein shares 70% amino acid sequence identity with the slow/cardiac isoform of troponin C (cTnC). However, three areas of significant sequence divergence were identified. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that murine sTnC is encoded by a single copy gene that is distinct from that which encodes cTnC. Northern blot analyses showed that the sTnC gene is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum and anterior tibialis) and not in neonatal or adult heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung, or testes. Studies of the murine C2C12 myoblast cell line demonstrated that sTnC gene expression is developmentally regulated during the differentiation of these myoblasts into myotubes. A full-length murine sTnC genomic clone was isolated and characterized by DNA sequence, primer extension, and S1 nuclease protection analyses. The sTnC gene is composed of six exons spanning 2.6 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. Although the introns do not divide the gene into functional domains, the intron-exon borders are nearly identical to those of the other members of the troponin C multigene family. Transient transfection assays using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids demonstrated that the sTnC promoter alone is relatively inactive in muscle cells and that high level sTnC gene expression in these cells is controlled by a potent transcriptional enhancer element located within the first intron of the gene. In additional transfection experiments, the sTnC enhancer was shown to display three important biological activities. (i) It was required for high level transcription from the sTnC promoter in muscle cells; (ii) its activity was muscle cell specific; and (iii) its activity was developmentally regulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. Taken together, these data define the sTnC gene as an excellent model system for studies of developmentally regulated gene expression in skeletal muscle. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Because of in vitro activity against colorectal tumors and antitumor responses in colon cancer patients in phase I trials, this phase II study was undertaken. Patients were treated with TNF administered daily for 5 days/week every other week at a dose of 150 micrograms/m2/day as a 30-min i.v. infusion. One cycle consisted of 4 weeks of treatment over an 8-week period. Twenty-five patients have been entered into this study with three patients ineligible. The 22 eligible patients ranged in age from 38-73 years and had initial performance status of 0 in 10 patients, 1 in 10 patients, and 2 in 2 patients. No complete or partial responses were seen. Two patients had stable disease (no response) and 18 patients progressed. Two patients had no evaluation and were assumed to have had no response. The response rate is therefore 0%, with a 95% exact confidence interval of 0% to 15%. There was one grade 4 toxicity consisting of nausea and vomiting. Most common grade 3 toxicities were chills and fever in four patients, nausea and vomiting in three patients, and anemia and elevated liver enzymes in two patients.

In those 30 patients with a diseased coronary artery, only 2 (6.6%) had no erectile dysfunction subjectively. On the contrary, 4 of 10 (40%) patients with angiographically proven normal coronary artery complained of erectile dysfunction. Penile Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 30 patients. The mean penile brachial index (PBI) of 8 patients with a normal coronary artery was 0.82 +/- 0.1, as compared with the diseased group, 0.73 +/- 0.1 (p = 0.05). When these patients were further divided into two groups by a PBI of greater or less than 0.65, there was also no significant difference in the degree of obstruction of the three main coronary arteries between these two groups. There was no correlation between PBI and obstruction of the left anterior descending artery (r = 0.316, p = 0.689). Most of the patients (93.4%) with an abnormal coronary artery had erectile dysfunction. Nevertheless a poor correlation was noted between the PBI and the severity of coronary artery obstruction. Our study suggests that it is hard to use PBI alone as a predictor of future major thromboembolic heart attack. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By plating amNG364 on E. coli Su3+ 45 degrees C, several pseudorevertants were found that proved to contain a suppressor (su) mutant in addition to the original am mutation. Crosses of two of these amNG364su strains to am+ phage indicated that the suppressors themselves are in or close to gene 32. Phage strains carrying either of the two su mutations, without amNG364, grew normally. When cells were infected by these su mutants and the proteins produced were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophroesis, specific overproduction of P32 was found. Maximum overproduction compared to am+ phage was 6.6-fold for one su mutant and 2.4-fold for the other. Other proteins were produced in normal amounts and in normal time sequence. When amNG364su phage were allowed to infect E. coli S/6/5(Su-), the gene 32 am fragments produced were present at the same derepressed levels as in an infection by amNG364 without a suppressor. The suppressor mutations are interpreted as causing derepression of P32 by altering sites in this autogenously regulated protein involved in template recognition. Previously, specific derepression of gene 32 had only been shown using gene 32 conditional lethal mutants grown under restrictive conditions. We have shown that P32 can also be derepressed under permissive conditions, indicating that loss of P32 function is not necessary for specific derepression. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These prior in vitro studies have not used human intraoral cell lines. We tested the effects of two eugenol containing and two non-eugenol periodontal dressings on cultured human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) (ATCC #1292). Replicate HGF cultures grown in microtiter plates were exposed to stock, 1:4 and 1:16 dilutions of extracts made from each of the four periodontal dressings. The HGF cultures were pulse labelled with tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Incorporations of the labelled thymidine were measured using liquid scintillation counting and expressed as counts per minute. The results showed that undiluted extracts from all four periodontal dressings totally inhibited 3HTdR uptake (P less than 0.05). The 1:4 dilution of eugenol dressings inhibited 3HTdR uptake significantly more than non-eugenol dressings (P less than 0.05). Interestingly, at 72 hours the 1:16 dilution of the non-eugenol dressings caused significantly increased 3HTdR uptake which was not observed with the eugenol dressings. The present results suggest that the use of a human fibroblastic cell line for testing the effects of periodontal dressings may provide information about the relative biological effects of these dressings. Using this cell line, we have found that eugenol dressings inhibit fibroblast proliferation to a greater extent than non-eugenol dressings. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the first series of experiments cumulative dose-response curves for propranolol, atenolol and ICI 118,551, nonselective beta-, beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists, respectively, were constructed in rats subjected to a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine. The administration of each of the beta-antagonists caused a significant dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The ED50 values for the increase in MAP were found to be 3.6 +/- 0.8, 10 +/- 2.6 and 4.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/kg for propranolol, atenolol and ICI 118,551, respectively. In the second series of experiments, a single bolus injection of a selective or nonselective beta-antagonist or saline vehicle was given to rats subjected to a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine. Plasma levels of A and NA were determined in the control condition, during the infusion of phentolamine and again after the injection of a beta-antagonist. The infusion of phentolamine significantly decreased MAP and increased plasma levels of A and NA.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Histamine made the muscle strips contract spontaneously every 1-5 min, and this allowed measurement of the time course of phosphorylation in relation to force development under conditions where diffusion of the agonist through tissue would not complicate the interpretation of the data. In the absence of histamine, phosphorylation was low [0.12 +/- 0.04 mol P/mol of the 20,000-Da light chain (LC 20)]. Phosphorylation was slightly (but not significantly) higher in the presence of 10 microM histamine in the relaxed state between contractions (0.20 +/- 0.03 mol P/mol LC 20). In muscle strips frozen during force development, when force had reached half of its peak value, phosphorylation was 0.38 +/- 0.06 mol P/mol LC 20. The highest levels of phosphorylation (0.49 +/- 0.04 mol P/mol LC 20) were found in strips frozen at the peak of the rhythmic contractions. Strips frozen when force had declined to half of the peak force showed low levels of phosphorylation (0.17 +/- 0.07 mol P/mol LC 20), indicating that the myosin light chain phosphatase activity was quite high. Mathematical modeling of the kinase and phosphatase reactions suggested that the apparent first-order phosphatase rate constant was at least 0.08 s-1 under these conditions. To obtain a better estimate of this rate constant, a second series of phosphorylation measurements were made early in the relaxation phase of the rhythmic contractions. The highest phosphatase rate constant obtained from these measurements was 0.23 s-1.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this study we have demonstrated with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry the reversible expression of c-sis/PDGF-2 and PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) b mRNAs and their respective protein products in epithelial cells and fibroblasts following cutaneous injury in pigs. Epithelial cells in control, unwounded skin did not express c-sis and PDGF-R mRNAs, and fibroblasts expressed only PDGF-R mRNA. The expression levels in the injured site were correlated with the stage of tissue repair, being highest during the initial stages of the repair process and declining at the time of complete re-epithelialization and tissue remodeling. It is suggested that the controlled, reversible expression of a potent mitogen and its receptor induced by injury may function in an autocrine/paracrine manner on both epithelial cells and fibroblasts to bring about their sustained proliferation during the normal healing process. These studies provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms contributing to normal tissue repair. We suggest the possibility that a defect in these mechanisms may be associated with defective wound healing. It is also conceivable that \"chronic\" injury may induce irreversible gene expression leading to pathologic, unregulated cell growth. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this communication, we examined the regulation of the spo0H gene of Bacillus subtilis by using lacZ reporter gene assays, quantitative RNA determinations, and Western immunoassay. The expression of the spo0H gene increases as the culture enters the mid-logarithmic stage of growth. This increased expression requires the genes spo0A, spo0B, spo0E, and spo0F, and the requirement for at least spo0A and spo0B can be bypassed when the abrB gene is mutated. The expression of the spo0H gene is constitutive in the presence of the abrB mutation, being expressed at higher levels during vegetative growth. In addition, the sof-1 mutation, in the spo0A structural gene, can bypass the need for spo0F in spo0H expression. The transcriptional start site of spo0H was determined by using RNA made in vivo as well as in vitro. These studies indicate that spo0H is transcribed by the major vegetative RNA polymerase, E sigma A. spo0H RNA and sigma H levels during growth are not identical to each other or to the pattern of expression of spoVG, a gene transcribed by E sigma H. This suggests that spo0H is regulated posttranscriptionally and also that factors in addition to sigma H levels are involved in the expression of genes of the E sigma H regulon. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The ribonucleotide GTP is a poor substrate with a much lower affinity. It is hydrolyzed with a Km of 150 microM and Vmax of 0.07 mumols/min/mg. Bacteriophage T7 encodes a specific inhibitor of dGTPase, the gene 1.2 protein, that forms a tight complex with the enzyme. The enzyme-inhibitor complex binds dGTP with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.5 microM, but the bound dGTP is not hydrolyzed. It remains stably bound to the complex with a half-life of approximately 5 min. In contrast, dGTP is unable to bind to gene 1.2 protein alone, and dGTP bound to dGTPase alone is quickly hydrolyzed and released. Surprisingly, the dGTPase-gene 1.2 protein complex has a higher affinity for GTP than for dGTP. GTP is stably bound to the dGTPase-gene 1.2 protein complex with a half-life greater than 30 min and KD of 0.8 microM; GTP is not stably bound to either dGTPase or gene 1.2 protein alone. Both GTP and dGTP bind to and stabilize the dGTPase-gene 1.2 protein complex, inhibiting its dissociation. Although the presence of dGTP induces conformation changes in dGTPase so that it is unable to associate with the gene 1.2 protein, saturating concentrations of GTP have no such effect. The enzyme efficiently associates with its inhibitor in the presence of GTP. These results indicate that E. coli dGTPase and gene 1.2 protein interact to form a high affinity GTP-binding site. dGTP is most effective in preventing the association of the enzyme with the inhibitor whereas GTP is most effective in preventing the dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Stereomicroscopic examination of the eyes of nu/nu mice 24 h after corneal trauma and topical bacterial application revealed slightly cloudy corneas (iris visible), whereas nu/+ littermate corneas were opaque (iris not visible). Nu/+ mice failed to resolve the infection, and endophthalmitis and shrinkage of the infected eye occurred in these mice within 2 weeks after experimental Pseudomonas infection, as in the parent BALB/c strain. However, nu/nu mice, similarly infected, resolved the infection within 24 h and never exhibited full corneal opacity or eye shrinkage. Histological examination of the corneas of nu/nu mice 24 h after experimental wounding and bacterial application demonstrated subepithelial capillaries and a few polymorphonuclear neutrophils (with numerous intracellular bacteria) in the central cornea. In contrast, the equivalent corneal areas of infected nu/+ littermates, examined similarly, showed a more striking neutrophilic response (but with few intracellular bacteria) to similar bacterial infection, as well as a lack of blood vessels within the central cornea. The central corneas of uninfected and saline control nu/nu mice also were observed. This area in nu/nu mice exhibited an infrequent polymorphonuclear neutrophil (with no intracellular bacteria) and capillaries similar in size and location to those described for experimentally infected nu/nu mouse corneas. Untreated and saline control nu/+ mice, on the other hand, lacked both vessels and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the central cornea. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

With the exception of a 385-bp block of DNA present in the 1.7-kb element, these transposable elements are structurally similar, sharing terminally inverted and internal direct repeated sequences. Derivation of 1.4-kb elements from the 1.7-kb class via deletion of internal sequence is suggested by the finding that a portion of the extra DNA in Mu1.7 is part of a truncated direct repeat sequence in the 1.4-kb element. An abundant poly(A)+ RNA homologous to a portion of this extra DNA is present in several tissues of both Mutator and non-Mutator lines. Analysis of transcripts from an unstable mutant bronze 1 (bz) allele containing a Mu1.7 element inserted in an exon of the gene detects three species of poly(A)+ RNA that hybridize to a Bz1 (Bronze) gene probe: the largest contains the entire Mu1.7 element in the Bz1 gene transcript; another appears to be a spliced, chimeric transcript; the smallest is normal size Bz1 mRNA. The latter is most likely encoded by the normal-size alleles detected by Southern analysis of tissue expressing purple pigment, suggesting that normal gene function is restored by excision of the Mu1.7 element. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Analysis was performed by gas-liquid chromatography of the acetoxy methyl esters of the bile acids prepared after alkaline hydrolysis of the bile salts. An internal standard served to correct for methodological losses. Low levels of bile acids were found in serum samples, precluding overt hepatobiliary complications. Deoxycholic acid (17-160 mumol/L), chenodeoxycholic acid (18-305 mumol/L), and cholic acid (3-119 mumol/L) were detected in 11 of 12 samples of BCF. In 2 cases, chosen at random, the identities of the bile acids were verified by mass spectrometry. Lithocholic acid (9-23 mumol/L), a reported cocarcinogen, was detected in 6 of the 12 samples of BCF. This is the first report of the presence of lithocholic acid in BCF with confirmation by Mass spectrometry. There was no correlation between the levels of individual bile acids and those of potassium ion, Na+/K+, estriol-3-sulfate, or 16 alpha-hydroxyandrogen sulfates that had been quantified previously in these samples. There was borderline correlation between concentrations of total bile acids and K+ (P less than 0.06) and Na+/K+ (P less than 0.07). Yet to be elucidated are the mechanism of accumulation of bile acids in BCF and whether levels of particular bile acids in BCF may serve to identify that small subset of women with fibrocystic disease at risk for developing breast cancer. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Mean weight loss after treatment (12-14 weeks) was 12.0 and 16.5 kg for D and DE respectively (P less than 0.05; D. v. DE) and fat loss (9.5 kg and 13.5 kg for D and DE respectively, D v. DE P less than 0.05). Nine subjects dropped out during the follow-up phase. After 18, 36 or 42 months follow-up the diet group regained 90% of their initial weight loss compared to 60% of the diet-exercise group (P less than 0.05). Seven subjects out of the original diet-exercise group kept up their exercise activities, while two subjects from the diet group started exercising. These subjects (EX) gained only 23 per cent of their weight loss, but their body weight at the start of the study tended to be lower compared to the diet and the diet-exercise group (86.5 (EX) v. 91.4 and 95.2 for D and DE respectively). During the last follow-up measurement SMR of 18 subjects was determined and revealed a persistent lower SMR for nine non-exercising subjects (18.6 per cent lower than before treatment), whereas for subjects who kept on exercising, SMR was 9.8 per cent lower than baseline values. Per kg FFM SMR was almost restored to baseline values for the EX group, whereas the non-exercising subjects still showed depressed values (EX 3.7 per cent and D + DE 15.8 per cent lower than before treatment; P less than 0.05). It was concluded that exercise is one of the factors which contributes to the restoration of SMR and long term weight maintenance. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This technique permits optimal microanatomical preservation of all tissues covering the convexity of the brain: skin, muscle, cartilage or bone, and the meninges. At ED11, the zone situated between the epidermis and the brain is occupied by a mesenchymal network. At ED12, part of this delicate network develops as a dense outer cellular layer, while the remainder retains its reticular appearance, thus forming an inner layer (the future meningeal tissue). At ED13, the dura mater starts to differentiate. At ED14, the bony anlage of the skull can be identified, and along with the proceeding maturation of dura mater some fibrillar structures resembling skeletal muscle fibers appear in the developing arachnoid space. At ED15-17, a primitive interface zone - dura mater/arachnoid - is formed, comprised by an outer electronlucent and an inner electron-dense layer marking the outer aspect of the arachnoidal space. At ED18-19, the innermost cellular row of the inner dural layer transforms into neurothelium, which is separated from the darker arachnoidal cells by an electron-dense band. The arachnoidal trabecular zone with the leptomeningeal cells is formed at ED19. By the end of the prenatal period (ED20-21), its innermost part organizes into an inner arachnoidal layer and an outer and inner pial layer. The results from this study indicate (i) that dura mater and leptomeninges develop from an embryonic network of connective tissue-forming cells, and (ii) that the formation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-containing spaces accompanies the differentiation of the meningeal cellular layers. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

They have been maintained over 5 years receiving prophylaxis every 3 months and clinical evaluation once a year. 1,746 teeth were used and extracted and retreated teeth were not included. The presence or absence of bleeding on probing was recorded for each tooth over the five yearly examinations. After recording the site variations between the 1st and the 5th year maintenance values, the highest value of attachment loss per tooth was selected. Teeth were considered diseased when they presented at least one site with 4 mm of probing pocket depth at the baseline (year 1) and 2 mm of attachment loss after 5 years (Criterion 1), or showed 3 mm of attachment loss after 5 years (Criterion 2). The prevalence of disease was 8.19% (143 teeth) for Criterion 1 and 19.7% (344 teeth) for Criterion 2. Bleeding on probing 2 times presented the highest sensitivity (86% Criterion 1 and 64.5% Criterion 2) and the lowest predictability (11.9% Criterion 1 and 21.4% Criterion 2). Bleeding on probing frequency = 5 times showed the highest specificity (93.6% Criterion 1 and 93.4% Criterion 2) and predictability (93.4% Criterion 1 and 81.5% Criterion 2). These results demonstrated that bleeding on probing may not be substituted for clinical attachment levels when evaluating the periodontal attachment loss over time. However, the high specificity and predictability of these tests as a negative one suggests that absence of bleeding after probing may be a good indicator of maintenance of periodontal attachment levels over time. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Families from the clinic roster, containing two adults and at least one child between the ages of 1 and 18 years, were asked to participate. Baseline (pre-influenza) data included a serum determination for influenza A and B antibodies, family functioning as measured by the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES) II and the Family APGAR, and parental stress as measured by the social readjustment rating scale (SRRS). During the study all family members of patients with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms or fever were seen, and throat swabs were obtained for viral culture. Approximately 2 weeks after the influenza epidemic ended (March 1984), sera for antibodies were again collected on all family members. Chi-square analysis showed that infection (defined as a fourfold titer rise or a positive viral throat culture) was significantly associated with both cohesion and adaptability as measured by FACES II. Neither the Family APGAR nor the SRRS was associated with influenza B infection. It was concluded that family functioning affects the frequency of influenza B infection within families. This finding raises the possibility that family dysfunction may lead to altered immune responses, which increases susceptibility to infection. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We show that renin and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)--the key enzymes involved in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation--and Ang II receptors, are present in pregnant and postpartum rat ovaries. From gestation Days 2-4 to 10-12, active ovarian renin ranged from 1.12 +/- 0.13 to 1.27 +/- 0.19 ng Ang I/h/mg and comprised between 68 and 86% of total (active+inactive) ovarian renin activity. Between Days 10-12 and Days 14-16 of pregnancy, ovarian active renin activity increased slightly, but inactive renin disappeared, suggesting its activation; the remaining active renin then decreased 62% by Days 18-20 (p < 0.05). On postpartum Day 2, both active and total ovarian renin activity exceeded that of Days 2-20 of pregnancy (p < 0.05); levels of both then declined sharply by postpartum Day 3 (p < 0.05). In pregnant rats, levels of ovarian Ang II receptors, identified by the specific binding of [125I]-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to ovarian membranes, were high between Days 2-4 and 10-12 of pregnancy, ranging from 12.8 +/- 1.7 to 15.7 +/- 3.4 fmol/mg, but steadily declined by 82% between gestation Days 10-12 and 18-20 (p < 0.05). Postpartum Ang II receptor levels on Days 2, 3, and 4 showed a gradual increase from low levels comparable to Days 18-20 of pregnancy.

Although tumor yield was similar in the 2 groups (25 and 22%, respectively), there was clear difference in immunogenicity; 10 of 16 sarcomas from fibroblasts treated during week 1 of culture were nonimmunogenic, whereas 8 of 9 tumors from the older cultures were immunogenic (P less than 0.02). A kinetic study of normal fibroblasts in DC revealed that cells proliferated rapidly, with a peak at day 4 after seeding, then grew progressively more slowly and ceased to replicate between 14 and 28 days of culture.

Since PDN-21 (katacalcin or the carboxyl-terminal flanking peptide of the calcitonin gene) and CT are cosecreted in normal subjects and in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we sought to determine the potential utility of PDN-21 as a tumor marker for lung cancer. We measured carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neurone-specific enolase (NSE), iCT, and PDN-21 in 119 to 378 healthy subjects, 88 to 91 patients with benign pulmonary disease, and 249 patients with advanced lung cancer (108 small cell lung cancers and 141 other forms). Tumor marker specificity was satisfactory: the percentage of increased values (greater than the 95th percentile of normal subjects) in patients with benign pulmonary diseases varied from 9% (NSE, PDN-21) to 12% (CEA). PDN-21 was a more sensitive marker for lung cancer than iCT: the percentage of increased values was 44% for PDN-21 versus 19% for iCT, and 51% versus 23% for the subgroup of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). PDN-21 concentrations were increased in 69 (34%) of 202 patients with a normal iCT level, whereas iCT concentrations were increased in only six (4%) of 139 patients with a normal PDN-21 level. However, markedly elevated concentrations of the two markers generally occurred in the same patients and the correlation between the two markers was significant (rs = 0.60; P less than 0.01). PDN-21 provided complementary information to that from the classical markers NSE and CEA.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The various properties of the patient's prolidase were compared to those of prolidase from a control and the patient's mother. Prolidase I from a control and the patient's mother had a molecular weight of about 112,000, and was composed of two subunits with an identical molecular weight of 56,000. The Km values for Gly-Pro of the control's and the patient's mother's prolidase I were 2.90 +/- 0.22 and 2.88 +/- 0.27 mM, but the Vmax values for Gly-Pro of the mother's enzyme was reduced about 30% compared to that of control enzymes (mother: 6.02 units/mg protein, control: 22.21 units/mg protein). Isoionic points of these enzymes by chromatofocusing were pH 4.6 approximately 4.7. Prolidase II from the control and the patient's mother, and the patient's prolidase had a molecular weight of about 185,000, and was composed of two subunits with an identical molecular weight of 95,000.

No significant exocytosis occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This absolute requirement for Ca2+ is eliminated by suspending the cells in a hypotonic buffer containing 60 to 80 mM K+; Na+ cannot substitute for K+. Optimal Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis occurs in a buffer containing 20 mM dipotassium Pipes, pH 7.1, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 7 mM Mg acetate, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mM EGTA. The cells maintain this Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis even if they are preincubated with 1 mM EGTA for 40 min at 37 degrees C before triggering. Exocytosis is eliminated as isotonicity is approached by adding sucrose, NaCl, KCl, or potassium glutamate to the buffer. Quin 2 fluorescence measurements reveal only a very small rise in [Ca2+]i when the cells are triggered in hypotonic buffer in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and the presence of 1 mM EGTA. In isotonic buffer, degranulation does not occur under conditions that lead to such a small rise in [Ca2+]i. Sustained IgE receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, which is also Ca2+ dependent in isotonic buffer, becomes independent of Ca2+ in the hypotonic buffer. In fact, the rate of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in hypotonic buffer in the absence of Ca2+ (and presence of 1 mM EGTA) is twice that observed in isotonic buffer in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. These data show that in hypotonic buffer, the requirement of IgE receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis for extracellular Ca2+ is eliminated, and degranulation proceeds with a [Ca2+]i of 0.1 microM, the baseline level of [Ca2+]i found in resting cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in isotonic buffer, the Ca2+ requirement for mast cell degranulation is for the generation of second messengers via hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositols. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Limited digestion with trypsin of the receptor from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa membranes resulted in the conversion of the native 130-kDa receptor into a single membrane-associated ANF-binding proteolytic fragment of 70 kDa. The 70-kDa fragment bound ANF with enhanced binding affinity but retained intact ANF-R1 pharmacological specificity and was still sensitive to modulation by amiloride. Trypsin treatment of the membranes produced a dual effect on ANF binding. Low concentrations of trypsin (less than or equal to 25 micrograms/mg of protein) increased ANF binding while higher concentrations dose dependently reduced the binding of the hormone. The increase of ANF-binding activity was associated with the formation of the 70-kDa fragment while the loss of ANF binding paralleled the degradation of the 70-kDa fragment. Low concentrations of trypsin drastically decreased the ANF-sensitive guanylate cyclase activity of the membrane fraction. This loss of catalytic activity strongly correlated with the formation of the 70-kDa tryptic fragment. We also evaluated the effect of ANF binding on the susceptibility of the receptor to proteolytic cleavage. The occupied receptor exhibited a greater sensitivity to trypsin digestion than the unoccupied protein, consistent with the hypothesis that hormone binding induces an important conformational change in the receptor structure. On the other hand, the 70-kDa fragment was much more resistant to proteolysis when occupied by ANF, suggesting that the ANF-binding domain forms a very compact structure.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Central haemodynamic variables were determined by Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheterisation and arterial cannulation. Graded increases in lower body positive pressure were applied to supine patients using Medical Anti-Shock Trousers (MAST). Increasing lower body positive pressure by 25 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg caused increases in mean right atrial pressure (6.0 to 13.2 to 17.9 mm Hg; p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0001 respectively) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (26.8 to 35.5 to 41.3 mm Hg; p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 respectively). No significant changes were seen in left heart filling pressures or in pulmonary vascular resistance. Furthermore, there were no significant increases in indices of cardiac work (cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, right ventricular stroke work index or cardiac power output) despite the increased right heart filling pressures. These results show that in patients with longstanding severe congestive heart failure, short term increases in cardiac return may increase right heart pressures but do not appear to cause either beneficial or detrimental changes in left heart haemodynamic indices. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In Cucumaria, the acrosome is in the form of a diffuse acrosomal vesicle. It is unusual in that it apparently lacks an acrosomal membrane. A membrane separating the acrosomal vesicle from the periacrosomal material may not be equivalent to a typical inner acrosomal membrane. In Ophiopholis, the acrosome is dense, with some internal substructure, and is enclosed by a complete acrosomal membrane. In both species, the acrosome is partially surrounded by an amorphous periacrosomal mass. There is a notable absence of a subacrosomal depression and associated structures as found in other echinoderm sperm. The centriolar satellite complex (CSC) is essentially identical in both species. A reconstruction of the CSC is presented. The CSC consists of nine satellites radiating angularly from the distal centriole, each bifurcating at a dense node before inserting on a marginal ring containing circumferential microtubules. The ring is probably a cytoskeletal element. Immediately below the satellites are nine Y-shaped connectives, connecting each of the axonemal alpha doublets to the flagellar membrane. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Cooperating preference was assayed by determining the levels of helper activity provided by antigen-primed T cells derived from such thymic chimeras for hapten-primed B lymphocytes obtained from conventional F1 or parental donors in adoptive secondary antibody responses in vivo. The results of these analyses revealed a tendency of helper T cells derived from parental thymic chimeras to provide better help for B cells of the same parental type corresponding to the origin of the thymus graft than for the opposite parent. Such preference was, however, only marginal and rarely were differences in levels of helper activity provided to the respective parental types statistically significant. Moreover, this marginal preference, when observed, pertained only to responses of the IgG class; no concordant preference in providing helper activity for IgE antibody responses was observed even with the same populations of thymic chimera helper T cells. Finally, in no instance was there any evidence of restriction in the classical sense of presence versus absence of help as we have routinely observed in all of our previous studies concerning genetic restrictions of T-B-cell cooperative interactions. Although the basis for differences in the studies reported here when compared to observations made in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte systems is unclear, and could reflect genuine mechanistic requirements concerning what directs H-2 restrictions in helper T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, respectively, it is also possible that we are placing too much faith in our interpretations of data obtained in bone marrow chimera systems than is perhaps justified by the potentially great fragility of such systems. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The testes from the PCB-treated trout were darker in color, smaller in size, contained less spermatic fluid, and appeared to be regressed when compared with testes from the control fish.

Three classes of mutants were obtained. Two-thirds of the strains were mutants in hemA. Representative of a third of the mutations was the hem-201 mutation. This mutation was mapped to min 8.6 to 8.7. Complementation of the auxotrophic phenotype by wild-type DNA from the corresponding phage 8F10 allowed the isolation of the gene. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the hem-201 gene encoded ALA dehydratase and was similar to a known hemB gene of E. coli. Complementation studies of hem-201 and hemB1 mutant strains with various hem-201 gene subfragments showed that hem-201 and the previously reported hemB1 mutation are in the same gene and that no other gene is required to complement the hem-201 mutant. ALA-forming activity from glutamate could not be detected by in vitro or in vivo assays. Extracts of hem-201 cells had drastically reduced ALA dehydratase levels, while cells transformed with the plasmid-encoded wild-type gene possessed highly elevated enzyme levels. The ALA requirement for growth, the lack of any ALA-forming enzymatic activity, and greatly reduced ALA dehydratase activity of the hem-201 strain suggest that a diffusible product of an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway after ALA formation is involved in positive regulation of ALA biosynthesis. In contrast to the hem-201 mutant, previously isolated hemB mutants were not ALA auxotrophs and had no detectable ALA dehydratase activity.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Of 166 patients randomized to induction chemotherapy, 46 had N2 or N3 disease and were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the organ preservation treatment strategy on control of neck disease and survival. The clinical response of neck metastases to induction chemotherapy was significantly associated with subsequent salvage neck dissection (P = .008). The overall death rate was increased (P = .014) and survival time decreased in patients with less than a complete response in the neck after chemotherapy (P = .15). This was related primarily to failure to control the disease in the neck. The overall survival of patients achieving a complete response in the neck was improved over the randomized group of N2 or N3 patients treated with primary surgery. The findings suggest that response of neck nodes should be assessed independently of primary tumor response in trials of organ preservation strategies using induction chemotherapy, and that failure to achieve a clinical complete response in the neck warrants planned early salvage neck dissection in order to achieve improved overall survival. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, failures do occur before and after loading. This study examined the differences in marginal bone loss between standard and self-tapping fixtures and attempted to explain excessive marginal bone loss or loss of osseointegration during the first 3 years of loading. Marginal bone loss (scored on long cone radiographs) and fixture failure rate were compared for different fixture designs. For standard fixtures, in comparison with self-tapping fixtures, the failure rate was clearly higher before as well as after loading. However, for successful fixtures no difference in marginal bone loss was observed. For the conical fixtures an increased marginal bone loss around the smooth part was observed. The effect of fixture overload, marginal bone height and loss of osseointegration was examined in 69 patients with 1 and 15 patients with 2 fixed full prostheses, and in 9 patients with an overdenture in the upper jaw. Excessive marginal bone loss (more than 1 mm) after the first year of loading and/or fixture loss correlated well with the presence of overload due to a lack of anterior contact, the presence of parafunctional activity and osseointegrated full fixed prostheses in both jaws. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To determine whether the degree of regional shape distortion (RSD), or dilatation, on early two-dimensional echocardiogram (2-D echo) after AMI can identify potential expanders, serial clinical and echocardiographic data were studied prospectively in 244 consecutive patients with a first Q-wave AMI. Initial (mean 2 days) and final (mean 10 days) two-dimensional echocardiograms were compared for regional LV asynergy, RSD, and conventional indices of expansion measured on endocardial diastolic outlines of mid-LV short-axis sections. Analysis of clinical and 2-D echo data revealed 51 expanders and 193 nonexpanders. Expanders showed greater LV dysfunction and more inhospital deaths (27% vs. 8%, p less than 0.001) compared with nonexpanders; conventional indices of expansion showed more marked increase between initial and final two-dimensional echo in expanders, but initial indices were not predictive. In contrast, the new RSD index Pk, a measure of the outward bulge, was markedly greater in expanders than nonexpanders on both initial (16.5 vs. 2.4 mm, p less than 0.001) and final echo. Furthermore, expanders with greater than or equal to 30% increase in Pk (to 21 mm) developed rupture of the ventricular septum (n = 10) or free wall (n = 2). Also, 50 of 51 expanders compared with 3 of 193 nonexpanders had a Pk greater than or equal to 10 mm on the initial echo. A simpler index, the depth of RSD (rd), provided similar discrimination as Pk. Thus, the degree of diastolic RSD on an early 2-D echo after AMI can identify potential expanders. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Integrated X-ray intensities for 3798 reflections with I greater than 2 sigma (I) were measured with a rotating anode diffractometer at room temperature. The structure was determined using direct methods. Block diagonal least squares refinement gave R = 0.111. Molecules A and B have almost fully extended conformations, but differ significantly in the rotation about the ester bond and in the C17 chains. The molecular packing in the crystal structure of cholestanyl caprylate consists of stacked bilayers each having d002 = 43.8 A in thickness and within each bilayer, cholestanols pack with cholestanols and caprylate chains pack with caprylate chains. The crystal structure is very similar to that of cholesteryl myristate but is quite different from that of cholesteryl caprylate. The phase equilibria of the cholestanyl caprylate/cholesteryl caprylate binary system have been shown to involve limited mutual solubility of the two components and to have a eutectic point at 73% cholestanyl caprylate.

It has been ultrastructurally localized to both lamina densa and adjacent epithelial cell membranes in rodent kidney. In the present study, we have sought to determine the localization of entactin in mouse skin. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (the latter via immunoperoxidase technique) were performed on both intact and NaCl-separated mouse skin, using a well-characterized IgG class entactin-specific rat x mouse monoclonal antibody. At the light microscopic level, entactin was present in all skin basement membranes. On NaCl-split skin, staining was noted solely on the dermal portion. At the electron microscopic level, in intact skin, entactin was primarily localized to the lamina densa and adjacent upper papillary dermis. However, smaller amounts of immunoreaction products were also detectable within the lamina lucida and in close apposition to overlying hemidesmosomes. In partially separated skin, immunoreactants were similarly noted above the level of the lamina densa. However, in completely separated areas, hemidesmosomal or cell membrane staining was no longer visible. We conclude that entactin is an ubiquitous component of mouse skin basement membranes. Similar to previous findings in rodent kidney, entactin is present in multiple regions of skin basement membrane, although its primary localization remains within and directly beneath the lamina densa. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To determine whether bronchodilators, the supine position, or eating affect gastroesophageal reflux, we performed ambulatory 24-hr pH monitoring on 44 controls and 104 unselected adult asthmatics. All asthmatics had discrete attacks of wheezing and documented reversible airway obstruction of at least 20%. The presence or absence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms was not used as a criterion for patient selection. Chronic bronchodilator therapy was required by 71.2% of the asthmatics, and was continued during the test. Asthmatics had significantly worse GER than controls during the 3-hr postprandial period, which continued into the nonpostprandial period up to the next meal. Significant differences were present for esophageal mucosal acid contact time, frequency of reflux episodes, and clearance times. During the nonpostprandial periods asthmatics had four times the acid reflux as controls and 19-fold the frequency of prolonged reflux episodes. There were no differences between asthmatics on bronchodilators and those not on bronchodilators in any of the reflux parameters during the upright (postprandial, nonpostprandial) period or supine (sleep) period (P = NS). We conclude that: (1) regardless of the use of bronchodilator therapy, asthmatics have significant GER when asleep and after meals that continues beyond the postprandial period to the next meal; and (2) asthmatics receiving bronchodilators have similar gastroesophageal reflux patterns after eating, in the nonpostprandial period, and when asleep as asthmatics not receiving bronchodilators. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Three consecutive courses of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy were administered at equal doses so that each patient acted as his own control. Of 100 patients randomized, 85 received at least two of the three agents and were evaluable for analysis. Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with more than ten vomits compared to either oxazepam (P less than 0.05) or methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Lorazepam also significantly reduced the number of patients with the most severe degrees of vomiting compared to either oxazepam or methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.005). The duration of vomiting was reduced significantly after the first 48 hours postchemotherapy for those patients receiving lorazepam over those receiving methylprednisolone (P less than 0.05). Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with severe nausea compared to both oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.05), but there were no significant differences in duration of nausea among the groups. The results of linear analogue self-assessment scores indicated a strong patient preference for lorazepam over both oxazepam and methylprednisolone. Drowsiness was significantly more common with both lorazepam and oxazepam compared to methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Patients who received lorazepam or oxazepam also experienced significantly more severe drowsiness than those patients receiving methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Lack of recall was significantly more common with lorazepam than with oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001) and was more profound when lorazepam was compared with oxazepam (P less than 0.05) and with methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Methylprednisolone was administered with minimal side effects.

Although this may be understandable, even today, due to the political factors involved, it is amazing that the research on the morbidity and mortality of people of working age does not aim at comprehensive analyses of etiological factors behind these types of health outcomes. Our knowledge on the health needs of workers is limited, in most countries we even lack any information on distribution of the major illnesses amongst the various occupational categories. Some information, however, is currently being gathered, based on the need to make operational the concept of work-related diseases which has been put forward by WHO. The US NIOSH programme on work-related diseases, or the Danish TOP-11-Programme, serve as examples for these types of developments. Additional need to study the causes of ill-health, and ways to counteract them amongst the working population, results from the health promotion action that has also been developed as a part of the HFA 2000. The aim of this overview is to study the importance of occupational and non-occupational factors in the etiology of the ill-health of workers. Evidently, such analyses are premature today. However, some anecdotal examples will be mentioned. The major emphasis of the paper is, however, laid on the needs for the coordination and evaluation of occupational health and other health programmes concerning those of working age. Some assumptions will also be made on the development of occupational health and the consequences of this development for those who are occupational health practitioners. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The authors report the case of a 70-year-old man with consciousness disturbance after non-penetrating head injury. CT scan showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cistern, and angiography on the next day revealed ophthalmic artery-superior ophthalmic vein fistula in the right orbit. During the clinical course of this lesion, there was mild chemosis of the right eye, without palsy of extraocular muscles. Both papilledema and bruit were absent. Conservative treatment was chosen. On the 26th day after the head injury, repeated angiography showed complete disappearance of the fistula. The patient was discharged on the 39th day without neurological deficit. In the other two reported cases, intraorbital A-V fistulae were caused by direct-penetrating injury. But, in the present case the head injury was non-penetrating and blunt type. The pathogenesis was considered to be indirect injury of the intraorbital vessels at the retrobulbar portion, approximately where the artery and the vein crossed. As regards to treatment, simple observation may be the first choice, and spontaneous obliteration can be expected. If this does not occur, either embolization or ligation of the ophthalmic artery is suggested as the second choice as proposed by Freitas MAL et al. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The recombinant Nif::Vi plasmids obtained in this way were used as DNA hybridization probes to isolate homologous phages from a genomic library of ORS571 constructed in lambda EMBL3. Genomic maps were drawn for three ORS571 Nif gene loci. Forty-five Nif::Vi mutants in genomic Nif locus 1 defined two gene clusters separated by 8 kilobase pairs (kb) of DNA. In the first cluster, 36 Nif::Vi mutants mapped to a 7-kb DNA segment that showed DNA homology with Klebsiella pneumoniae nifHDKE and encoded at least two Nif operons. In the other cluster, nine Nif::Vi mutants mapped to a 1.5-kb DNA segment that showed homology with K. pneumoniae and Rhizobium meliloti nifA; this DNA segment encoded a separate Nif operon. Fifteen Nif::Vi mutants mapped to a 3.5-kb DNA segment defined as Nif locus 2 and showed DNA homology with the R. meliloti P2 fixABC operon. Nif locus 2 carries a second nifH (nifH2) gene. Four Nif::Vi mutants mapped to a 2-kb DNA segment defined as Nif locus 3 and showed DNA homology with K. pneumoniae nifB. DNA from lambda Nif phages comprising all three genomic Nif loci was subcloned in plasmid vectors able to stably replicate in ORS571. These plasmid subclones were introduced into ORS571 strains carrying physically mapped Nif::Vi insertions, and genetic complementations were conducted. With the exception of certain mutants mapping to the nifDK genes, all mutants could be complemented to Nif+ when they carried plasmid subclones of defined genomic DNA regions. Conversely, most nifDK mutants behaved as pseudodominant alleles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The scale was built with 20 subtests which covered the entire range of cognitive and motor functions. Each subtest was hierarchically organized so that success in a item implied success in inferior items. This hierarchical principle was time-saving and was validated by Cole and Dastoor. 149 control subjects performed this test. They were equally divided in 4 age-groups (55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85-97) and 2 educational levels. None of these subjects had previous history of somatic or neuropsychiatric disease. They were completely self-sufficient in daily life. A large part of the controls failed in the most difficult items of some subtests: Learning, Calculation, Mental Control, Drawing, Recall, Similarities, Constructional Praxis. For these subtests, significantly different mean-scores were observed between age-groups and educational levels. However, the influence of each factor was variable from one subtest to another. Moreover, subgroups seem to exist in our population according to specific difficulties in some of these subtests. This study calls for caution in the interpretation of results in demented patients. Comparisons with other psychometric tools remain to be performed. This scale seems to be more useful for the quantification and follow-up of cognitive deficits than for the early diagnosis of dementia. In addition, this scale, which briefly explores many aspects of cognitive functions, seems especially useful to approach the heterogeneity of DAT. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In men total cancer mortality was approximately constant around 270/10(6) between 1951 and 1965, but declined appreciably thereafter to 217 per million in 1980-1989. The overall fall was 20%. The pattern of trends was similar for women, although a modest decline was already apparent in the earlier calendar period, and the overall fall was 29% (from 303 to 215/10(6)). These favourable trends reflect therapeutic advancements for Hodgkin's disease, leukaemias, testis and (chiefly non-epithelial) ovarian cancer, better control of cervical cancer, the long-term decline in gastric cancer, but also the downward trends in cancer of the intestines and a few less common sites, such as gallbladder and thyroid neoplasms for reasons that are not yet clear. Appreciable rises were observed for lung and other tobacco-related sites in women, for the oral cavity in men and (in earlier calendar periods) cutaneous melanoma in both sexes. Although restricted to a selected number of sites, these rises are discouraging, since the causes of these neoplasms have long been recognized. Somewhat discouraging also is the absence of decline in male lung cancer. These problems notwithstanding, the overall pattern of trends in cancer mortality in young Swiss adults over the last few decades is still reassuring, particularly in comparison with those observed in other European countries, and in the more general framework of the debate on the perspectives of progress in cancer control. Although restricted to a small proportion of all cancer deaths, in fact, trends in young adults offer useful indications on the likely future trends in the same generations in the near future, since they reflect more recent changes in the pattern of exposure. The size of the changes, however, will probably differ, since the prevalent cancers in middle age are different from those in the young. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Suppression is mediated by macrophage-like suppressor cells. Since previous work had indicated that suppression involved the inhibition of the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the effects of BCG on interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monokine required for IL-2 production, were investigated. It was found that the release of IL-1-like activity in spleen cell cultures stimulated with LPS or Con A was increased by previous BCG treatment of the cell donors. In MLC, the release of IL-1-like activity was also increased by BCG. However, the detection of IL-1-like activity in MLC supernatants was prevented by the presence of a suppressor factor. In this case, the IL-1-like activity could be separated with gel filtration from the suppressor factor which had higher molecular weight. The production of IL-1-like activity by CBA/J spleen cells, which are not suppressed by BCG, was not significantly different from that of C57BL/6J cells, which are markedly suppressed. Moreover, the addition of IL-1 to the BCG-suppressed cultures not only did not restore normal reactivity, but actually further suppressed CTL formation. It was concluded that BCG-induced suppression cannot be attributed to decreased IL-1 activity. The suppressor factor discovered during these investigations may have a role in this type of suppression. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The mean concentrations of all the parameters except CEA and GGT1 were significantly different in HCC and CLD, but a broad overlap existed in the two groups, so different cut-offs were considered to assess the positive and negative predictive values and test efficiency (Eff). The best results were observed considering AFP greater than 100 IU/m (Eff0.86), ferritin greater than 800 ng/ml (Eff0.69), CA-50 greater than 100 U/ml (Eff 0.63), beta-HCG greater than 10 mU/ml (Eff 0.61), AP greater than 300 IU/ml (Eff 0.66), the presence of APL1 (Eff 0.78), 5'N greater than 25 mU/ml (Eff 0.70), gGT greater than 100 mIU/ml (Eff 0.63). Among HCC patients 17% did not secrete AFP; in 26% the protein was less than 100 IU/ml and in 36% less than 400 IU/ml. Apart from AFP the most effective marker was APL1. At the above cut-offs more than three parameters were simultaneously positive in 71% of HCC and 9.9% of CLD. CEA, CA50, AFP were the only parameters that distinguished the HCC from the LM group; in the latter, APL1 was also a very sensitive marker (87%) for neoplastic involvement of the liver. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A 5-year mosquito survey (1980-85) involved in the inspection of 348 sites (plus 173 reinspections) and the processing of nearly 60,000 specimens. 3. Twenty-four species in six genera were identified from larval and adult collections. Species of the genera Culex (41%) and Aedes (22%) were more commonly encountered than Culiseta (18%) and Anopheles (17%) species. Orthopodomyia (1.6%) and Coquillettidia (0.6%) were far less frequent. 4. The species composition was similar to that described for the years of the eradication campaign, except for the genus Anopheles. Of the eight Anopheles species previously recorded, only four species were identified in collections of 1159 larvae from eighty-five positive sites. 5. Anopheles labranchiae was the most frequently collected species of its genus (49%), but was represented in only 12% of the total collections. Comparison with previous records indicated a progressive increase in sites positive for An.labranchiae over the past 35 years. 6.

On the basis of total cholesterol values, as recommended by the Expert Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program, 6 subjects (2.8%) had high blood cholesterol (greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl), 27 (12.4%) had borderline-high blood cholesterol (200-239 mg/dl), and 184 (84.8%) had desirable blood cholesterol (less than 200 mg/dl). One of the 27 with borderline-high total cholesterol had two other coronary risk factors. Thus 7 of the 217 (3.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 6.8%) met Expert Panel criteria for lipoprotein measurement. Six of the seven had high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl). Four additional subjects with borderline-high total cholesterol, not identified by this sequential screening strategy, also had high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus a total of 10 of 217 (4.6%, 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 8.6%) met Expert Panel criteria for high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and initiation of cholesterol-lowering treatment. None of these 10 had been previously identified as having high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Two years later subjects with high or borderline-high total cholesterol were rescreened. Seven of 22 subjects completing the second screening were classified differently with regard to having high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, illustrating the potential for misclassification of individuals on the basis of a single measurement. The prevalence of women with high-risk low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not significantly different at the two screenings.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Twenty-four infants were at an appropriate size for gestational age; 19 were large for gestational age. At birth, 28 infants (65%) had abnormal serum iron profiles; eight had decreased ferritin concentrations only (stage 1), nine had decreased ferritin and increased total iron-binding capacity values (stage 2), and 11 had these serum findings plus elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations (stage 3). The hypoglycemic infants who were large for gestational age (n = 14) had a higher prevalence of abnormal iron profiles than euglycemic infants who were appropriate in size for gestational age (n = 20; 93% vs 50%; p = 0.009). Progressively abnormal iron profiles were associated with higher glycosylated fetal hemoglobin values, greater degrees of macrosomia, increased hemoglobin and erythropoietin concentrations, and increased erythrocyte/storage iron ratios. Erythropoietin concentrations were inversely linearly correlated with serum iron values (n = 32, r = -0.54; p = 0.003). The combined erythrocyte and storage iron pools were significantly lower in infants with abnormal iron values whose mothers were diabetic, particularly in infants of women with confirmed diabetic vasculopathy. We speculate that these findings are likely due to (1) increased fetal iron utilization during compensatory hemoglobin synthesis in response to chronic hypoxemia and (2) reduced iron transfer during late gestation complicated by diabetes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two individuals in each group were fast isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) and PA acetylators. The pharmacokinetics of PA and NAPA were analyzed with a computer program (SAAM 23). Volume of distribution (Vdss) and renal clearance of PA were similar in normal subjects regardless of acetylator phenotype. Nonrenal clearance was faster (383 vs. 244 ml/min), and PA elimination half-life (t 1/2) was shorter (2.6 vs. 3.5 hr) in fast acetylators. In the functionally anephric patients, Vdss was similar to that of normal subjects. Nonrenal clearence was faster (117.5 vs. 93.5 ml/min) and PA t 1/2 shorter (10.8 vs. 17.0 hr) in fast than in slow acetylators. In these patients, acetylation accounted for 56% of PA elimination, and NAPA concentrations reached 0.8 microgram/ml or more. The t 1/2 of NAPA in renal failure was 41.5 hr, in accord with predictions from studies in normal subjects, assuming no impairment in nonrenal NAPA elimination. PA metabolism, however, is severely impaired by renal failure, so PA t 1/2 was prolonged to an unpredictably greater extent than would be expected from studies in normal subjects. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Patients with such conditions are liable to have reduced exercise capacity (ExC). It is unclear whether selective arterial vasodilation in these patients can improve ExC. In a double-blind crossover comparative study of the effects of felodipine versus placebo in 10 patients with heart failure in NYHA class III, all patients decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac index (CI), not only at rest but also during exercise. Since heart rate (HR) did not change, the increase in CI was due to increased stroke volume (SV). This beneficial haemodynamic response did not, however, correlate with functional response to the drug. A mixed exercise response was obtained, with 3 patients showing an increase, 3 a decrease, and 4 no change in ExC with felodipine. Therefore, we investigated whether an alternative way of characterizing haemodynamic response would explain why individual patients responded differently to the same drug. We tested the hypothesis that vasodilator therapy would enhance ExC if it were able to alter the load facing the heart in such a way that the cardiac pump needed to impart less hydraulic power output to maintain the same degree of physical exercise. Patients who could perform with felodipine the same submaximal exercise for less cardiac effort than with placebo were the ones who could increase their ExC during the vasodilator therapy. The converse was also true. We conclude that exercise response to vasodilator therapy depended on whether the failing heart was rendered able to pump more efficiently by the drug. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A complete set of half-saturation constants (Km) was established for the two different substrates oxoglutarate and malate on both the external and the internal sides of the membrane. The internal affinities for oxoglutarate (Km 0.17 mM) and malate (Km 0.7 mM) were higher than the corresponding external affinities (Km 0.3 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively). The exclusive presence of a single transport affinity for each substrate on one side of the membrane indicated a unidirectional insertion of the oxoglutarate carrier into the liposomal membrane. The Km values and also the maximum exchange rates (8-11 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1) for oxoglutarate and malate were independent of the nature of the counter substrate on the other side of the membrane. Under these defined conditions we analyzed the antiport mechanism in two-reactant initial velocity studies varying both the internal and external substrate concentrations. From the kinetic patterns obtained, a sequential type of mechanism became evident, implying that one internal and one external substrate molecule form a ternary complex with the carrier before transport occurs. A quantitative analysis of substrate interaction with the unloaded or single-substrate-occupied carrier revealed that rapid-equilibrium random conditions were fulfilled, characterized by a fast and independent binding of internal and external substrate. This kinetic mechanism agrees with previous results obtained in intact mitochondria. Considering also the data available for other mitochondrial carriers, a common kinetic mechanism (sequential type) for this carrier family is suggested. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

An edge shift of about 2-3 eV to higher energy occurs upon oxidation of the Fe(II) enzyme to the Fe(III) species, corresponding to the valence change. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure shows clear differences in active-site structure as a result of this conversion. Curve-fitting on the new data of the Fe(II) enzyme, using the EXCURV88 program, leads to a coordination sphere that is in agreement with the active-site structure proposed earlier (6 +/- 1 N/O ligands at 0.205-0.209 nm with a maximum variance of 0.009 nm, including 4 +/- 1 imidazole ligands) [Navaratnam, S., Feiters, M.

During an average of 1.6 years of follow-up, 53 hip fractures occurred. The risk of hip fracture was inversely related to bone density at all three measurement sites. After adjusting for age, the relative risk of hip fracture was 1.66 for a decrease of 1 SD in the bone density at the calcaneus (95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 2.26), 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.11) at the distal radius, and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.88) at the proximal radius. None of the three measurements was a significantly better predictor of hip fracture than the others. After adjusting for bone mineral density, the risk of hip fracture doubled for each 10-year increase in age (relative risk, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 3.33). We conclude that decreased bone density in the appendicular skeleton is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, but this accounts for only part of the age-related increase in risk of hip fracture among older women. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The focal absence of epithelial cells in airways of patients with asthma is well documented. When the luminal surface of canine bronchi is rubbed gently, the only morphologic change observed is the disappearance of the epithelial cell layer. The removal of the epithelium causes an increased sensitivity of the bronchial smooth muscle to acetylcholine without alteration in the maximal responsiveness to the cholinergic transmitter. The augmentation cannot be attributed to reduced enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine after removal of the epithelial cells, since it is not affected by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. It cannot be attributed to disappearance of a diffusion barrier, since epithelium removal also augments the contractions evoked by electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerve endings. Removal of the epithelium potentiates the contraction evoked by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in a manner similar to that observed for acetylcholine. The potentiating effect of epithelium removal is more pronounced in larger rather than in smaller bronchi. By contrast, the relaxations evoked by beta-adrenergic agonists are less pronounced in bronchi without, rather than in bronchi with, epithelium. The influence of the epithelium on isoproterenol-induced relaxation is more pronounced in smaller rather than in larger bronchi. These observations suggest that the bronchial epithelium releases an inhibitory factor that partially counteracts activation of the airway smooth muscle by bronchoconstrictor substances.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results of Western blot and glycoprotein G immunodot enzyme assays showed that an additional 53 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus 2 infection, that another 20 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus type 1 infection, and that 23 patients were seronegative. Three commercial enzyme immunoassays were used to determine herpes simplex virus antibody subtypes. All three commercial assays performed poorly in all patient groups (except in patients who were seronegative for herpes simplex virus). Among the 40 patients with a first episode of genital herpes, seroconversion to the appropriate viral type was shown by the three assays in only 33%, 55%, and 75% of cases. Among patients with recurrent genital herpes, the three commercial assays identified more than 90% of patients with only herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies but failed to identify herpes simplex virus type 2 infections in 58% to 76% of patients with antibodies to both virus subtypes. The three assays correctly identified only 55%, 75%, and 85% of the 53 \"silent carriers\" of herpes simplex virus type 2. Overall, the three enzyme immunoassays detected herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies in 60%, 62%, and 93% of patients with subtype 2 infections and falsely detected type 2 antibodies in 8%, 27%, and 49% of patients with type 1 infections.

Increasing the proportion of the monosialoganglioside in the liposomes was found to increase both the extent of the lectin-induced liposome fusion and the rate of the reaction; below a threshold of approx. 5 mol%, the process was extremely slow. The increase in light scattering could be prevented by the addition of the hapten inhibitor, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (1 mM). Addition of the inhibitor, subsequent to the lectin, caused a partial decrease in light scattering due to the dissociation of unfused vesicle aggregates. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the ganglioside-containing liposomes were vesicles, 244 +/- 25 A (S.D.) in diameter. Upon addition of wheat germ agglutinin, the vesicles appeared to fuse to form larger vesicles, corresponding to dimers and trimers of the initial vesicles. Inhibition studies with a variety of monosaccharides indicated that the sialic acid moieties present in the ganglioside acted as the lectin-receptor sites. This was confirmed by the observation that wheat germ agglutinin did not interact with phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing desialyated ganglioside. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The study identified a group of 302 patients with untreated generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other seizure types) from the general population. Case finding was carried out using the key informant method over a 12-month period. The clinical characteristics of this cohort of patients, the majority of whom had never had previous contact with a formal medical system, is described. Most were young, living in a rural area, with a mean age of seizure onset of 14 years and a mean duration of seizures of 7 years. Thirty-eight per cent had a clinically evident focal disturbance associated with the tonic-clonic seizures. In 77% of the cases, no aetiology was established. Most cases had had a substantial number of seizures during the course of their condition and only about a third of the patients had less than 1 seizure a month in the previous year. Only 26% had ever had previous anti-epileptic drug treatment. In addition to the medical inquiry, psychological and sociological studies were also conducted and a prospective treatment programme was carried out. Throughout the study, strict definitions and standardised instruments were used, and the study was the result of a collaboration between local investigators, an international neurological team, the Kenyan Government agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. We consider this a model for community-based investigations for the management of epilepsy in developing countries. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This shortage is particularly acute in the pediatric population. A model was developed in sheep to simulate human pulmonary transplantation from adults into newborns. Pulmonary allografts were performed in 8 neonatal lambs (less than 10 days old) weighing between 2.5 and 5 kg. Unrelated adult sheep donors were used (weighing 55 to 82 kg). The recipient body weight was approximately 6% that of the donor, but ranged from 4% to 8%. Ipsilateral or contralateral upper lobe allografts were used, although the latter required inversion prior to implantation. All venous anastomoses utilized left atrial cuffs. The pulmonary arterial and bronchial anastomoses were constructed end-to-end. Following implantation the lobes were further contoured to fit within the recipient hemithorax using a linear surgical stapler. Animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine. Two animals died 1 week postoperatively but the remaining six survived 1 to 5 months. Postoperative lung scans at 10 to 14 days confirmed satisfactory ventilation and perfusion of the allografts. All vascular anastomoses were intact at postmortem examination. Primary bronchial healing accomplished without an omental wrap. We conclude that successful lung transplantation can be performed from adult donors into neonatal recipients. Preservation of the maximal arterial and venous length during native pneumonectomy is essential to allow matching of the vascular cuffs. Short donor lobar bronchi may be responsible for the reliable primary healing. Improved immunosuppression will be required to assess long-term function and growth of these reduced-size allografts. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

She was treated with prednisolone which was used for the first time. Two weeks later, she had a fever and her chest X-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular shadows on both middle to lower lung fields. In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, malaise and fever increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen. Anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody in the serum was 1:4,096 less than. Typical adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were also observed in the peripheral blood smear at the rate of 10-15% of leukocytes. The parasite was observed in the sputum too. We diagnosed her as having Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering ATL, and the pneumonia might have been induced by steroid therapy (total doses of 500 mg, for 25 days). After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms. We have been looking after her as an outpatient now, and she has neither symptoms nor signs. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Depletion of K+ from the culture medium resulted in a three- to five-fold potentiation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), KC (gro), and IP-10 mRNA expression in LPS-treated macrophages. The potentiating effect was apparently the result of inhibition of Na+/K+ exchange through the Na+/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) because ouabain-mediated inhibition of Na+/K(+)-ATPase was also able to potentiate cytokine mRNA expression as much or more than did K+ depletion. The effects of K+ depletion or ouabain treatment were not caused by depolarization of the macrophage membrane because depolarization mediated by elevating extracellular K+ levels was inhibitory to cytokine mRNA expression. Depletion of Na+ by substitution with choline in the culture medium also markedly potentiated LPS-induced gene expression. The Na+/H+ antiporter was not, however, involved in potentiating cytokine expression because treatment of macrophages with amiloride either had no effect on or was inhibitory to the LPS-induced changes in mRNA levels. The potentiation of gene expression was selective and was at least partially the result of increased transcriptional activity of each gene. Whereas Na+ depletion and ouabain both inhibited 86Rb+ uptake by macrophages, treatment with LPS had no effect either on Rb+ uptake or on efflux. Thus altered Na+/K+ exchange is not a component of the primary signalling pathway(s) mediating response to LPS. Nevertheless, modulation of macrophage Na+/K+ exchange by agents encountered during an inflammatory response may be an important determinant of the magnitude and quality of specific gene expression. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Intraperitoneal (IP) immunization of mice with CTX-gD(1-23) conjugate induced anti-HSV-2 sera antibody responses which correlated with protection from a lethal IP challenge with HSV-2. Intragastric (IG) immunization of mice with the same conjugate or a CTX-gD conjugate did not result in measurable anti-HSV-2 responses in sera or vaginal washings and only small numbers of anti-HSV-2 antibody-secreting cells (ASC) were found in intestinal lamina propria cell and splenocyte preparations. In comparison, anti-CTX responses were detected in sera and vaginal washings after IG immunization with CTX and anti-CTX ASC in lamina propria cell preparations accounted for 5-10% of total ASC detected at this site. No significant differences in the survival of mice immunized with the conjugates were noted after a lethal intravaginal (IVAG) challenge with HSV-2. The poor enteric immunogenicity of gD(1-23) and gD conjugated to CTX was attributable to proteolysis in the gastrointestinal tract. These results indicate that although peptide-CTX conjugates can induce protective immune responses when administered parenterally, it may not be feasible to use peptides as the basis of an oral vaccine unless methods are developed to protect these antigens from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Of 247 primary tumours, 178 showed evidence of oestrogen biosynthesis, levels varying between 0.5 and 12.5 fmol E2 produced/h/g tissue. These values were quantitatively small but at least comparable with those in other peripheral tissues. There was no correlation between presence or level of aromatase activity and the histopathology of the tumours although oestrogen biosynthesis was more likely to be present in more cellular tumours. Aromatase activity was also unrelated to age, menopausal status, lymph node status and T stage of the patient from which the tumour was derived. In a subgroup of patients presenting without clinical evidence of distant metastatic disease, no significant relation was detected between tumour aromatase and disease-free interval, but tumours without aromatase activity were associated with increased survival at 36 months after primary treatment. A statistically significant correlation was also detected between the presence of tumour aromatase and oestrogen receptors. Furthermore, in small subgroups of patients with \"advanced\" breast cancer tumour aromatase was related to response to aminoglutethimide but not tamoxifen therapy. Whilst these results do not conclusively define a role for local synthesis of oestrogen in the progression of breast cancer, this possibility still exists and further studies on tumour aromatase are warranted. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the mechanisms underlying this inhibiting action of CT are still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of intranasal (i.n.) and i.m. sCT administration on GH secretion elicited by direct pituitary stimulation in man with human GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) (1-29)NH2. Seven healthy non-obese volunteers (five men, two women; mean age +/- SDM 25 +/- 2) underwent a bolus intravenous injection of GHRH, 100 micrograms, alone or associated with sCT, administered either i.n., 300 IU, or i.m., 100 IU. Our data demonstrate a significant decrease in GH secretion after GHRH when either i.n. or i.m. sCT is administered. GH peak (mean +/- SDM); GHRH alone 22.9 +/- 2.5 vs GHRH plus i.n. sCT, 8.9 +/- 1.5 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001; or vs GHRH plus i.m. sCT 12.3 +/- 2.5 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that staurosporine, a known inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked PDGF-induced [Ca2+]i increases in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts by a mechanism that appeared unrelated to inhibition of protein kinase activity (Olsen, R., Melder, D., Seewald, M., Abraham, R., and Powis, G. (1990) Biochem. Pharmacol. 39, 968-972). In the present study, we report that staurosporine inhibits ligand-dependent PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activation in cell-free receptor preparations and in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. At the same concentrations (10(-8)-10(-6) M), staurosporine suppressed both the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C activity and the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides induced by PDGF stimulation of intact cells. In contrast, guanine nucleotide-binding protein-dependent phospholipase C activation induced by bradykinin or fluoroaluminate anion was relatively insensitive to staurosporine. A preferential inhibitory effect of staurosporine on signal generation by the PDGF-R was indicated by findings that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity and EGF-dependent phospholipase C in A-431 carcinoma cells were approximately 100-fold less sensitive to this drug. These data indicate that submicromolar concentrations of staurosporine inhibit PDGF-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization through a proximal inhibitory effect on ligand-induced activation of the PDGF-R tyrosine kinase. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There could be implications for anaesthetic management if these children also have decreased compliance during anaesthesia. To examine the changes in Crs before, during and following surgical correction of the atrial defect, Crs was measured in 29 infants and children, 15 undergoing correction of secundum type atrial septal defects, and a group of 14 children of similar weight undergoing non-thoracic surgery. During sedation, Crs was measured using the single breath technique (SBT) and during anaesthesia, both before and after the surgical procedure, an inflation technique was applied to determine Crs. To investigate the aetiology of the difference in Crs, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) was determined using echocardiography during sedation in the ASD patients. During sedation, Crs in the ASD group was 52.7 +/- 19.5% less than in the control group. The slope of the line of regression of Crs vs height for the ASD group was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that of the control group during sedation. However, during anaesthesia, Crs in the ASD group was not significantly different from the control group either before or after surgery. The per cent decrease in Crs during sedation in the children with ASD, in comparison with the control group, did not correlate with the Qp:Qs ratio of the ASD group (r2 = 0.012,NS). We conclude that, in spite of lower Crs during sedation, infants and children with ASD do not have lower Crs during anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass than normal controls undergoing non-thoracic surgery.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Limiting dilution cultures of non-immunized spleen cells of A/J mice with irradiated B hybridoma cells bearing the Ig idiotype, CRIA, in the presence of T cell growth factors developed cytotoxic activity against the CRIA-bearing hybridoma; in some wells this activity was completely abrogated by an anti-idiotype mAb specific for CRIA or by a univalent hapten antigen, tyrosine-p-azobenzenearsonate, indicating the existence of cytotoxic T cell precursors (CTL-P) specific for one or more idiotopes of CRIA in normal spleen cells. The CTL clones lysed targets in a H-2D-restricted manner and were cytotoxic for CRIA-bearing hybridoma lines, but not for CRIA-non-bearing, IgG1k-bearing hybridoma lines. These CTL-P were detected at a high frequency (1/4,500 to 1/10,000) in a spleen cell population of non-immunized, relatively aged A/J mice (16 to 30 wk of age), and at a lower frequency in spleen cells of younger A/J mice (8 wk of age). However, they were not detected in normal spleen cells of B10.A (CRIA-non-producer) mice at any age (less than 1/6 x 10(5)). Normal Ighd-congenic C.AL-20 mice (16 wk of age), that are CRIA producers had as a high frequency of the CTL-P as did A/J mice, whereas normal Ighb-congenic C.B-20 mice (CRIA-non-producers) had none. In the spleen cells of the CRIA-producers, cytotoxicity of the CTL-P developed only in cultures with small numbers of seeding cells. They were completely absent in cultures with greater numbers of cells; this may be due to the presence of suppressor cells of lower frequency but greater potency. In lymph node cells or PBL of relatively aged A/J mice, the CTL-P were also detected, but only in cultures containing higher cell numbers, and at low frequency (between 1/5 x 10(5) to 1/2 x 10(6)). In thymocytes of 8-wk-old A/J mice, they were occasionally detected at very low frequency (less than or equal to 1/1 x 10(6)), but were not present in the bone marrow cells at any age. These results demonstrate the high incidence of the generation of CTL-P specific for an autologous Ag, and indicate that CRIA on B cells may induce CTL specific for CRIA. However, the development of CTL-P may be inhibited by co-existent suppressor cells under normal conditions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

One, which was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, was a 47-kDa protein cross-reactive to an antibody raised against a portion of human 47-kDa cytosolic factor, a component of the human NADPH-oxidase activation system. Another one, designated here as the third component, was partially purified and found to contain 49- and 55-kDa proteins as the major constituents. No colored prosthetic group such as heme, flavin, and non-heme iron was detected in both cytosolic components. In a reconstituted assay system with a solubilized membrane preparation containing the dormant oxidase and with oleate as a stimulus, the 47-kDa protein together with the 63-kDa factor was essential for activating the dormant oxidase, while the third component was not essential for the activation of but enhanced the O(2-)-generation evoked by the former two components. Thus, the 47- and 63-kDa cytosolic proteins are the principal constituents of the activation system, while the other factors such as those contained in the third component may regulate the activity induced by the essential components. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We studied the mechanism of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) toxicity in proliferating lymphoid T-cells of different maturation stage, i.e. in T-cells of adult peripheral blood and cord blood and in CD3+ and CD3- subfractions of thymocytes. The mitogen-induced proliferation of T-cells from peripheral blood and cord blood and of CD3+ and CD3- subfractions of thymocytes. The mitogen-induced proliferation of T-cells from peripheral blood and cord blood and of CD3+ thymocytes, as well as the spontaneous proliferation of CD3- thymocytes, are inhibited by dGuo. CD3+ and CD3- thymocytes are significantly more sensitive to dGuo than T-cells from peripheral blood or cord blood. Among the thymocyte subfractions CD3- thymocytes appeared to be extremely sensitive. In all cell types studied, inhibition of proliferation is accompanied by intracellular increases in both guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) concentrations. By use of the PNP inhibitor 8-aminoguanosine, or the metabolites hypoxanthine or deoxycytidine, the metabolism of dGuo could be selectively directed to the formation of GTP or to dGTP. Based on the pattern of rescue from dGuo intoxication under these different metabolic conditions we conclude that in CD3- thymocytes dGuo toxicity is mediated by dGTP. In all other cell types studied GTP mediates dGuo intoxication. Altogether the results show that during the maturation from immature thymocytes to mature peripheral blood T-cells a shift occurs in the pattern of dGuo toxicity since dGuo toxicity in the former is primarily caused via the dCyd kinase pathway, and in the latter mainly the degradation route is involved. Since in PNP deficiency mature T-cells do occur in the peripheral blood, we must conclude that some cells escape the stage of T-cell maturation in the thymus which is extremely sensitive to dGuo. Furthermore, the results imply that as far as T-cell development in the normal thymus is concerned, survival and death of cells might be regulated by local (deoxy) nucleoside availability. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Funct. Genet. 6, 316-323] for the activation of the active-site thiol group by adjacent functional groups. The enhanced reactivity of iodoacetate, with respect to that of iodoacetamide, suggests the influence of a positive charge in the active site. The reactivity of iodoacetate is not affected by dissociation of an active-site functional group of pKa 6.7, which increases the reactivity of neutral reagents, probably because of a compensation phenomenon; it is, however, lost on dissociation of an acid of pKa 8.1. It is concluded that the active cysteine beta-lactamase has four functional groups at the active site, one nucleophilic thiolate of Cys-70, one neutral acid (most probably the carboxy group of Glu-166, from the crystal structures) and two cationic residues (most probably Lys-73 and Lys-234). A comparison of these results with the pH-dependence of reactivity of the native RTEM-2 beta-lactamase suggests that the active form of the latter enzyme is also monocationic, although the nucleophile (Ser-70) is likely to be neutral in this case and the carboxylic acid dissociated. A mechanism of class A beta-lactamase catalysis is discussed where the Glu-166 carboxylate acts as a general base/acid catalyst and Lys-73 is principally required for electrostatic stabilization of the anionic tetrahedral intermediate. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

For each sample, two determinations of the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) and Whole Blood Partial Thromboplastin Time (WBPTT) were performed. Similarly, an Azure A Assay standard curve of absorbance versus heparin concentration was constructed for the same blood. Three replicates of the procedure were performed, and the average relative error in each assay was computed as the 95% confidence interval on the regression line divided by the slope of the regression curve. Parallel studies were also performed to assess the effect of various plasma constituents on the Azure Assay. Results indicate that all of the assays are equally accurate for heparin levels at or below 2 U/ml, while the ACT and Azure assays are equivalent at heparin levels near 4 U/ml, but the WBPTT is not usable at concentrations above 2 U/ml. The Azure Assay is not sensitive enough for very low heparin levels (less than 1 U/ml), but it is quite accurate and, indeed, is the only rapid assay for heparin concentrations higher than 4 U/ml. In the sensitivity studies, variations in albumin levels and plasma platelet count were shown to have a significant effect on the accuracy of the Azure assay, whereas calcium levels had no effect. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, the nasal resistance is not the same throughout the total respiratory phase. Therefore, the reference point to express the resistance is therefore necessary to facilitate the mutual comparison of the data. The international committee for standardization of rhinomanometry has been paying a great effort to decide where this reference point should be set up, but has not yet reached the final consensus. The purpose of this study is to present a new method to estimate nasal respiratory conductivity, regardless of the reference point. Pressure flow curves during nasal respiration are quite similar in nature and rarely cross one another. The parabolic curves which do not cross each other can be superimposed by multiplying the standard equation, V = n.f(P). Accordingly, n is only one parameter in comparing these curves. A standard curve is decided as follows. Rohrer's equation was examined by polynomial regression analysis and concluded to be adequate to simulate a pressure flow curve. Rohrer's equation is converted to the function of P. Integration of this equation along P gives the value of the area under the curve (AUC). The total AUC can be obtained by simply adding the AUC of right and left sides. Definite integration from the origin to 1.0 and 2.0 on the abscissa gives the numerical value of AUC in each curve. The mean AUC is easily calculated by simple mathematical averaging of the data. K1 and K2 of the standard curve are calculated by solving simultaneous equations using mean AUC. K1 and K2 during expiration and inspiration are calculated, respectively. 718 subjects who had not been recently suffered from nasal diseases were examined by active anterior rhinomanometry. 47 functionally normal subjects in twenties were selected for calculation of the standard curve using the above mentioned method. In expiration, the values of K1 and K2 were 0.5476 and 1.3653, respectively. In inspiration, they were 0.4080 and 1.4750. Individual curve can be expressed by only one parameter. The normal range during nasal respiration is considered to be more than 0.7. The method presented in this study is convenient for the mutual comparison of the data both in clinical and basic research. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The spectral response analysis is useful for defining the frequency and intensity regions over which a neuron is excited or inhibited. However, the conventional spectral response analysis only defines this distribution for the synaptic polarity (excitation or inhibition) which dominates the duration of the response. PST histograms of dorsal cochlear nucleus neurons however, often exhibit both excitatory and inhibitory (i.e. pause) components. The distribution of these transient pause intervals may in turn be highly dependent on stimulus parameters suggesting that the spectral area of excitation and inhibition, when considered in terms of short time frames, may be time-dependent. We performed a temporal analysis of the spectral response areas of neurons in the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus and present here an example based on a neuron showing distinct pauser and buildup responses in its PST histograms. The resulting analysis yielded a time course of the spectral response area which indicates that the transient periods of inhibition may have the effect of narrowing the bandwidth of excitation during the early portion of stimulation.

A comparative study of the serum LH levels in human subjects as measured by this RRA and by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the same standard preparation was then conducted. The serum LH profile throughout the entire menstrual cycle and the pituitary responsiveness to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) stimulation during the two phases of the cycle were studied in two normal women. In addition, LH levels in two normal postpubertal men were measured in blood samples obtained before and after LH-RH administration. Similar, although not identical, LH profiles were found in all cases by both hormone assay methods. Higher RRA-assayable LH values were obtained throughout the menstrual cycle as compared with those obtained by RIA. A significant LH-RH pituitary response in terms of LH in both RRA and RIA during the luteal phase was observed as compared with that observed during the early follicular phase. In the two normal men, the LH values obtained with RRA were higher than those obtained with RIA. It is concluded that the LH RRA is a practical and efficient tool for clinical research. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The mean and standard error of superoxide anion (O2-) generated in nm/1.5 X 10(5) PBM/well for 5 normal subjects and 3 IM patients was 2.9 +/- 0.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.2, respectively. Monocytes stimulated with 100 ng C-reactive protein (CRP) incorporated into liposome gave values of 3.3 +/- 0.3 and 2.7 +/- 0.1 nm O-2/1.5 X 10(5) PBM/well for normals and IM, respectively. No significant differences in O2- production between liposome and liposome with incorporated CRP were shown. PBM from lepromatous patients demonstrated a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in O2- production with liposome alone compared with tuberculoid patients (3.5 +/- 0.4 vs 1.8 +/- 0.3). The most dramatic suppression of O2- shown when purified CRP was added to the mixtures in all groups examined [0.4 +/- 0.1 (500 ng), 0.3 +/- 0.0 (500 ng), 1.5 +/- 0.1 (100 ng), and 1.3 +/- 0.6 (100 ng) nm O2-/1.5 X 10(5) PBM/well for normals, IM, lepromatous, and tuberculoid, respectively]. Results of O2- formation with incorporation of CRP into liposome as compared with liposome alone had no significant effect on PBM of lepromatous or tuberculoid patients.

Polyclonal antibodies to hepatic NAT isolated from rapid acetylator rabbits were raised in a goat and utilized for immunoblot analyses and enzyme inhibition studies. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that hepatic and duodenal cytosols from rapid but not slow acetylator rabbits contained an immunoreactive 33-kDa protein. No immunoreactivity was observed for lung or kidney cytosols from either rapid or slow acetylators. The inhibition of sulfamethazine and p-aminobenzoic acid acetylation by polyclonal antibodies was investigated using cytosols from rapid and slow acetylator rabbits. With rapid acetylator cytosols, maximal inhibition of hepatic, duodenal, and lung NAT activities was 94.4 +/- 9.0%, 92.5 +/- 8.5%, and 28.3 +/- 2.4%, respectively, for sulfamethazine (500 mM) acetylation and 90.1 +/- 8.0%, 80.2 +/- 6.4%, and 26.7 +/- 3.1%, respectively, for p-aminobenzoic acid (500 microM) acetylation. Using 25 microM p-aminobenzoic acid as substrate, maximal inhibition of NAT activity was 32.0 +/- 2.1% with liver cytosol and 5.8 +/- 0.16% with duodenal cytosol, whereas no inhibition of lung NAT activity was observed. Kidney NAT activity was not inhibited by the polyclonal antibodies. With slow acetylator cytosols, no inhibition of NAT activities was observed. It is concluded that at least two NATs are present in liver, duodenum, and lung of rapid acetylator rabbits. Furthermore, the principal NAT in liver and duodenum is immunologically related to the minor form of lung NAT and is antigenically distinct from kidney NAT of rapid acetylators. Hepatic, duodenal, lung, and kidney NAT(s) of slow acetylator rabbits is (are) immunologically distinct from the major hepatic NAT in rapid acetylators. The data support the model in which the hepatic polymorphism in rabbits is caused by the total lack of the major rapid acetylator hepatic NAT in the phenotypic slow acetylator animal. These observations may have significant implications in the organ-specific toxicities of carcinogens that undergo metabolic activation via N-acetylation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The low temperature phosphorescence spectra and lifetimes of calf gamma-II, III, and IV crystallins did not reflect heterogeneity among the gamma-crystallins. The 0-0 bands were all at 414 +/- 1 nm and the emission lifetimes were all single-exponential with lifetimes of 5.1, 5.3 and 5.3 +/- 0.3 sec, respectively. In contrast, phosphorescence measurements at room temperature were sensitive to subtle differences in exposure, accessibility, and flexibility of gamma-crystallin tryptophan residues. Thorough deoxygenation allowed for measurement of the normally-quenched room-temperature phosphorescence, and we report the first native phosphorescence measurements of lens crystallins at ambient temperature. The emission maxima for gamma-II, III and IV were 446, 442, and 440 +/- 2 nm, respectively. The intensity decay curves were all non-single exponential, and the decays were fit to a sum of two exponentials with lifetimes of 9.1 and 93 msec (gamma-II), 11 and 75 msec (gamma-III), and 4.2 and 68 msec (gamma-IV), +/- 10%. The components of the gamma-II emission were assigned to the four tryptophans based on X-ray structural information. Quantum yields of the phosphorescence emission were in the ratio of 20:7:1 for gamma-II, III and IV, and comparison of lifetimes and quantum yields suggests that tryptophan rigidity increases in the order gamma-IV less than III less than II. Acrylamide quenching constants for the long-lived components of gamma-II and III were roughly equal, while the short-lived tryptophans of gamma-III were an order of magnitude more accessible than those of gamma-II. The wide range of phosphorescence lifetimes and quenching constants allowed for discrimination of distinct contributions to the phosphorescence emission, and we suggest that room-temperature phosphorescence measurements will be an effective tool for studying conformational changes of lens crystallins. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In sodium replete dogs AII produced renal vasoconstriction with decreased RBF (-28%; P less than 0.001), but with less decrease of GFR (-14%; P less than 0.001), leading to an increase of FF (+19%, P less than 0.001), andantidiuresis (-39%, P less than 0.001); the antinatriuresis (-58%; P less than 0.001) exceeded the antidiuresis (P less than 0.001). delatRBF (-10%; P less than 0.001) was less pronounced (P less than 0.001) during AII in sodium deplete dogs, GFR remained unchanged, but FF increased to the same extent (+16%; P less than 0.05); diuresis and urinary electrolyte excretion were however not affected. AIIA did not affect RBF, GFR, FF, nor diuresis in sodium replete dogs suggesting that endogenous AII has no tonic influence on renal function in these conditions. In sodium deplete animals AIIA produced an 11% (P less than 0.001) increase of RBF, without changes of GFR; FF decreased by 12% (P less than 0.01), but diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis were not affected. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cells from normal persons were found to be agglutinated by anti-C3d but not by anti-C3c. To a fixed dilution of antiserum, the normal C3d AH values (X +/- 2 SD) were 34 +/- 19% for adult cells (n = 29) and 14 +/- 19% for cord cells (n = 19); the difference was significant (P less than 0.0001). By pretreatment of these cells with trypsin the C3d AH was either completely abolished or markedly reduced. Its difference between the adult and cord cells was eliminated as the observed values were 4 +/- 7% and 3 +/- 4% respectively (P = 0.15). The supernatant fluid of cell-trypsin mixture, treated with trypsin inhibitors, was found to be inhibitory to C3d AH but not to C3c AH. In contrast, the AH of C3d-coated red blood cells resulting from complement fixation in vivo (ie, cold agglutinin disease) or in vitro (eg, sucrose water reaction) was resistant to trypsin treatment. The difference between the trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant cell-bound C3d is postulated to be at its attachment mechanism to the cell membranes. In addition, both the advantage and limitation of using trypsinised cells for C3d antiglobulin tests are demonstrated. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A quantitative analysis of the time-dependent component of outward membrane current in atrial wall trabeculae from Rana catesbeiana and Rana ridibunda has been carried out using a double sucrose gap technique. 2. Separation of the different components of delayed outward current was hampered by the sigmoid onset of one of the outward current systems ixfast and by the development of potassium ion accumulation which prevented current activation from reaching a steady state at positive membrane potentials. Semilogarithmic analysis of positive current decay tails recorded immediately following square voltage clamp depolarizations was therefore used to separate the two membrane conductance components ixfast and ixslow and the third component, attributable to potassium ion accumulation, which was almost invariably present in the tails. 3. It is shown that inaccuracies in this method of semilogarithmic separation of components caused by visual assessment of the i3 (accumulation) line are minor compared with the large changes in the time constants of ixfast and more especially of ixslow which would result from ignoring the potassium accumulation component. 4. Such semilogarithmic separation of the three components of outward current gave separate activation curves for each of the two membrane conductance components, ixfast and ixslow. 5. Measurement of 'total' activation curves in which all components of outward current were represented could be made more easily and fairly reliably. The position and shape of these activation curves on the voltage axis were found to closely resemble those obtained by three component separation. It is therefore suggested that such a simplified analysis reflects the properties of the individual currents sufficiently well for it to be of use in preliminary studies of, for example, drug action. 6. The kinetic properties of the atrial outward currents have been investigated over a wide potential range. Because of the presence of potassium ion accumulation, an indirect method of obtaining the average value of 1/gamma for outward current decay at negative potentials had to be employed. 7. It is shown that some degree of inward-going rectification is associated with the outward current systems of frog atrium. 8. The possible reasons for the differences between the analysis presented here and those presented earlier by us (Brown & Noble, 1969a, b) and by Ojeda & Rougier (1974) are discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A growth delay of about 25 days was produced with CDDP (5 mg/kg) and hyperthermia (43 degrees C, 30 min) prior to radiation (3 Gy daily for 5 days) on day 1. The addition of MISO (1 g/kg) on day 1 resulted in a tumor growth delay of about 28 days. The addition of ETA at 0.5 g/kg or 1 g/kg resulted in tumor growth delays of about 33 and 43 days, respectively. Tumor cell survival assay showed that MISO was additive with CDDP either at 37 degrees C or with hyperthermia (43 degrees C, 30 min). In contrast, ETA at both 0.5 g/kg and 1 g/kg was dose modifying over the CDDP dosage range at 37 degrees C or 43 degrees C. Analysis of tumor cell killing in Hoechst 33342 selected bright (presumably oxic) and dim (presumably hypoxic) tumor cell subpopulations demonstrated that the addition of MISO to the CDDP trimodality regimen increased killing in the dim cell subpopulation, while the addition of ETA increased tumor cell killing in both subpopulations, although the greater effect was in the dim cell subpopulation. These results indicate that ETA may add to the efficacy of the CDDP trimodality in the clinic and may be of value as a chemosensitizer with CDDP. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After the incubation, the development of lipid peroxidation was determined as thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reacting materials in total lipid extracts from the incubated hepatocytes. Cellular injury was observed as a leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from hepatocytes into incubation medium. The contents of reduced glutathione (GSH) in hepatocytes were also assessed. Results obtained were as follows: (1) CrVI facilitated lipid peroxidation in isolated hepatocytes after 20 min of incubation. On the other hand, the cellular injury induced by CrVI was barely observed even after 60 min of incubation. (2) The CrVI-induced lipid peroxidation was inhibited by catalase and mannitol as scavengers of active oxygen species, or N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and alpha-tocopherol as antioxidants. However the cytotoxicity of CrVI could not be prevented by these chemicals. (3) CrVI depleted the contents of intracellular GSH and diminished the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) except glutathione peroxidase. (4) The scavengers of active oxygen species and the antioxidants could not prevent the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by CrVI.

The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years (range 13 to 87 years). During the years 1981 and 1987, approximately 90% of the total valvular surgery population received the prosthesis. The early mortality was 7.0% (included patients with concomitant procedures including coronary artery bypass and ascending aortic aneurysm resection). Late mortality was 4.0% per patient-year. The total cumulative follow-up was 4,237 years. Thromboembolism (TE) was 2.4% per patient-year (fatal 0.4% per patient-year) (minor 1.2%; major 1.3%); antithromboembolic therapy-related hemorrhage (ATH) 0.5% (fatal 0.07%); prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) 0.5% (fatal 0.2%); periprosthetic leak (PPL) 0.3% (fatal 0%); clinical valve dysfunction (CVD) 0.3% (fatal 0.02%); and structural valve deterioration/primary tissue failure (SVD) 0.2%/patient-year (fatal 0%). Thromboembolism and structural valve deterioration were the significant complications, SVD occurring primarily between the fourth and fifth year of evaluation. The overall patient survival was 77.1% +/- 1.4% at five years. The patients were classified as 89.6% NYHA functional Class III and IV preoperatively and 96.1% Class I and II postoperatively. The freedom at five years from TE was 90.6% +/- 1.0%; SVD 98.9% +/- 0.5%; and reoperation 95.9% +/- 0.9%. Freedom from all valve-related complications at five years was 84.1% +/- 1.3%; valve-related mortality 96.8% +/- 0.7%; mortality and reoperation (valve failure) 92.9% +/- 1.1%; mortality and residual morbidity (treatment failure) 93.7% +/- 0.9%; and mortality, residual morbidity, and reoperation (valve failure and dysfunction) 90.0% +/- 1.2%. There were 28 valve-related deaths of a total 280 deaths (early 4, late 24) (TE 17; ATH 3; CVD 1; PVE 7; PPL 0; and SVD 0). Valve-related reoperations were performed in 32 patients (TE 2; CVD 4; PVE 7; PPL 11; and SVD 8).

We purified MPF from a 100,000g supernatant of crushed, naturally spawned carp oocytes using four chromatography columns: Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow, p13suc1-affinity Sepharose, Mono S, and Superose 12. The final preparation was purified over 1000-fold with a recovery of about 1%. On Superose 12, MPF eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 100 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of the active fractions after Superose 12 revealed the presence of four proteins of 33, 34, 46, and 48 kDa. A monoclonal antibody against the PSTAIR sequence of cdc2 kinase recognized the 33- and 34-kDa proteins for which the 46- and 48-kDa proteins are endogenous substrates. The 46- and 48-kDa proteins were recognized by a monoclonal antibody against Escherichia coli-produced goldfish cyclin B, but not by an anti-cyclin A antibody. When oocytes were matured in the presence of 32P, the labeling was seen with the 34-kDa protein, but not with the 33-kDa protein. The 34-kDa protein corresponded to the MPF activity, but the 33-kDa protein did not. These findings indicate that carp MPF is a complex of cdc2 kinase and cyclin B, and further that active MPF contains the phosphorylated form of cdc2 kinase. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Of these sick children, 300 were reported as having visited the clinic, compared with 240 actually recorded as having symptoms/complaints, or 9.3 events per child per year. Nearly all of the morbidity (95%) fell into 4 major categories: respiratory, nervous system and sensory infections and digestive diseases. As reported in the health interview, the clinic was visited in 50% of the episodes; the frequency and types of diseases reported were similar for both the clinic records and the health interviews. The most clinic visits were for acute infectious diseases (100%); the least for chronic diseases (none). According to the health interview, 62% of those visiting the clinic were referred to a physician and 38% to a nurse. The corresponding percentages from the clinic records were 60 and 40, respectively. In general, the relative distribution by disease categories was similar in both health interviews and clinic records. The only significant differences were for respiratory diseases, in which a higher incidence was reported in the health interview. In the matching test between health interviews and records of clinic visits, only partial matching was found.

The (3H)-leucine-labeled, secreted IgM from these LA173 cells also formed precipitin complexes with purified protein A. Soluble complexes formed at high protein A/IgM ratios retained the ability to bind to the bacterial surface. Precipitin complexes also were observed in double diffusion Ouchterlony gels with a line of identity formed between the IgM, protein A, and anti-IgM in adjacent wells. Intracellular IgM species from detergent-lysed LA173 cells were bound to S. aureus. Labeled 19S pentamers, 8S monomers, and HL subunits were eluted from the bacteria and identified by velocity sedimentation and SDS agarose-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, several intermediates migrating between 8S and 19S were detected and shown to contain authentic H and L chains. Binding of the labeled IgM 19S pentamers to staphylococci was not inhibited by prior treatment of the bacteria with an excess of unlabeled human IgG. However, S. aureus saturated with unlabeled IgG did not bind either labeled IgM monomers or labeled IgG. The interaction of this human IgM with S. aureus exhibited a high degree of specificity with quantitative recovery of secreted 19S IgM.

Flagellar loss induces a rapid, transient increase in expression of a specific set of genes encoding flagellar proteins, and assembly of a new flagellar pair. While flagellar gene expression and initiation of flagellar outgrowth are normally tightly coupled to flagellar excision, our results demonstrate that these processes can be uncoupled by manipulating Ca2+ levels or calmodulin activity. In our experiments, wild-type cells were stimulated to excise their flagella using mechanical shearing, and at times after deflagellation, flagellar lengths were measured and flagellar mRNA abundance changes were determined by S1 nuclease protection analysis. When extracellular Ca2+ was lowered by addition of EGTA to cultures before excision, flagellar mRNA abundance changes and flagellar outgrowth were temporally uncoupled from flagellar excision. When extracellular Ca2+ was lowered immediately after excision or when calmodulin activity was inhibited with W-7, flagellar outgrowth was uncoupled from flagellar excision and flagellar mRNA abundance changes. Whenever events in the process of flagellar regeneration were temporally uncoupled, the magnitude of the flagellar mRNA abundance change was reduced. These results suggest that flagellar gene expression may be regulated by multiple signals generated from these events, and implicate Ca2+ as a factor in the mechanisms controlling flagellar regeneration. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The first group consisted of three yearlings isolated from other horses but in contact with each other for 418 days, whereas the second comprised seven mares and their foals, which were sampled at monthly intervals from parturition until the foals were about 180 days old. There was a complex pattern of transmission, with 15 different viruses isolated from both groups. Four distinguishable viruses were isolated from the three yearlings by day 16 of quarantine, and by day 141 an additional two viruses were isolated. Up to five different viruses were isolated from one yearling. Although four repeat isolations of one virus from the nasal cavity of one yearling over 54 days indicated that equine herpesvirus 2 established persistent infection with constant shedding, most repeat isolations yielded distinguishable viruses. Identical viruses were isolated from the nasal cavity and leukocytes of one yearling and the nasal cavity and vagina of another, indicating that a particular equine herpesvirus 2 strain was not site specific. Although seven different viruses were isolated from the three yearlings throughout the quarantine period, two appeared to establish latent infections; one virus was not isolated until 141 days after quarantine, whereas the second was first isolated 16 days after quarantine and then for the second time, from the same horse, 402 days later. Multiple concurrent local infections were demonstrated by the isolation of two or more viruses from the same nasal swab. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

LTC4 and 3H-LTC4 incubated for 20 min at 37 degree C in serum containing TGM, convert into LTE4 and 3H-LTE4, respectively. Thus, LTC4 released from A23187-stimulated macrophages is an intermediate in TGM which rapidly converts into LTE4, probably because of the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and cystenylglycinase in TGM. Macrophages express antitumor cytostatic activity towards P815 cells (49-53%) in a cocultured ratio (macrophage: tumor cell) 2:1 when stimulated with 3.5 x 10(-7) M A23187 in TGM. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor AA861 reverses the cytostatic activity by 42-58% and it inhibits also the formation of A23187-induced 5-lipoxygenase products from macrophages. Restoration of 38% macrophage- antitumor cytostatic activity by exogenous LTC4 (10(-8) M) indicates that LTC4 is an essential 5-lipoxygenase intermediate in the pathway of required signals underlying A23187-induced macrophage antitumor cytostatic activity.

A search for a cheaper and less allergizing product led to triamcinolone hexacetonide, this procedure being known as \"nucleorthesis\". The first results at 6 months were encouraging. In 3 centres where triamcinolone hexacetonide was tested with a more than 2 years\\' follow-up 92 patients could be evaluated. The results obtained were considered satisfactory in 34 patients (36.9 percent), but they were poor in 19 patients (20.6 percent), and 39 patients (42 percent) had to be operated upon within 2 years. Return to surgery took place within the 6 months following nucleorthesis in 18 patients (19.56 percent) and beyond this period in 17 patients (22.8 percent) with degradation of the results. Moreover, calcifications were found in 19 out of 38 patients; they were of varying size, sometimes detected only at computerized tomography, and some of them appeared to produce symptoms. All considered, the failure rates, the number of patients who required surgery and the occurrence of large and sometimes symptomatic calcifications make triamcinolone nucleorthesis unacceptable compared with the recognized percentages of success with papain nucleolysis and surgical operations. For these reasons, we consider that this treatment should be abandoned. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A control group of 13 healthy Caucasian men was also evaluated. Before treatment, diabetic subjects had low mean cell hemoglobin concentration values and increases in both erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels and erythrocyte hexokinase activities. Although all three of these changes are associated with a decrease in hemoglobin O2 (Hb-O2) affinity, P50 values were normal in diabetic subjects. Moreover, P50 values normalized to pH 7.4 (P50(7.4] were inversely related to the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Both erythrocyte 2,3-DPG and erythrocyte ATP were also inversely related to HbA1c. Vitamin B6 nutriture, as determined by erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, was normal in all diabetic subjects before vitamin B6 therapy. Nonetheless, HbA1c levels decreased after 6 wk of treatment with 150 mg/day pyridoxine and increased again during placebo administration. These changes were not explained by changes in fasting blood glucose. Pyridoxine therapy also decreased P50(7.4) values and increased erythrocyte AST and ALT activities but had no effect on 2,3-DPG, ATP, or the activities of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. These observations suggest that 1) nonenzymatic glycosylation may play a role in regulating both erythrocyte metabolism and Hb-O2 affinity in diabetic subjects, and 2) vitamin B6 therapy may modify nonenzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin in this population. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

D., Qin, L., Beck, J. L., Suslick, K. S., Koga, H., Horiuchi, T., & Sligar, S. G. (1990) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112, 7396-7398]. This single tryptophan-containing protein thus represents an excellent system for studying the solution dynamics of a residue directly implicated in an electron-transfer pathway. Steady-state and time-resolved measurements of the tryptophan fluorescence have been conducted across the emission spectrum as a function of redox state to probe potential structural changes which might be candidates for structural gating phenomena. The steady-state emission spectrum (lambda max = 358 nm) and anisotropy (alpha = 0.04) suggest that Trp-106 is very solvent-exposed and rotating partially free of global protein constraints. The time-resolved fluorescence kinetics for both oxidized and reduced putidaredoxin are fit best with three discrete components of approximately 5, 2, and 0.3 ns. The lifetime components were assigned to physical species with iodide ion quenching experiments, where differential quenching of the longer components was observed (k tau = 2 = 5.9 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, k tau = 5 = 1.3 X 10(8) M-1 s-1). These findings suggest that the multiexponential fluorescence decay results from ground-state conformational microheterogeneity and thus demonstrate that the essential tryptophan exists in at least two distinguishable conformations. Small differences in the relative proportions of the components between redox states were observed but not cleanly resolved.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It has demonstrated efficacy against human cytomegalovirus infections and should be considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of life- or sight-threatening cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompromised patients. Clinical efficacy varies with the underlying aetiology of immunocompromise and the site of disease, and prompt diagnosis and early treatment initiation appear to improve the response. In patients with cytomegalovirus pneumonia, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients, concomitant administration of cytomegalovirus immune globulin may significantly improve clinical outcome. Maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence is usually required by bone marrow transplant recipients until the recovery of adequate immune function, whereas AIDS patients may require indefinite ganciclovir maintenance therapy to prevent disease progression, as ganciclovir (like other antivirals) does not eradicate latent viral infection. Haematological effects occur relatively frequently during ganciclovir administration but are usually reversible. Ganciclovir has not been directly compared with other antiviral drugs because of the absence until recently of other effective treatments. However, comparative studies with foscarnet, particularly in cytomegalovirus retinitis, will be of considerable interest. Thus, ganciclovir represents a major advance in the therapy of severe cytomegalovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. Comparative studies, and investigation of ways of reducing toxicity (intravitreal administration; concomitant use of stimulants of haematopoiesis; use in conjunction with other antivirals with differing mechanisms of action), may further expand its eventual role. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The addition of either sodium formate, formamide, formaldehyde, or sodium nitrite to enzyme which reacts in a single rapid kinetic phase with cyanide causes a blue-shift of 4-6 nm of the net (cytochrome a + cytochrome a3) Soret maximum. Only the derivative prepared by adding sodium formate demonstrates measurable intensity in the g' = 12 region of the low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum. This g' = 12 resonance is characteristic of cytochrome oxidase which has undergone a modification at the binuclear center and thereby reacts sluggishly with cyanide. As the site of cyanide binding in resting enzyme as been demonstrated to be CuB [Yoshikawa, S., & Caughey, W.S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7945-7958], it is proposed that formate can bind to CuB and the fast to slow transition is rationalized by using this proposal. The g' = 12 signal is also produced upon the addition of sodium formate to mitochondrial preparations, suggesting that the species responsible for this behavior may have possible physiological relevance. Physical properties of the formate derivative and data for other reagents reacted with the fast-reacting enzyme preparation are presented. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In seven conscious dogs, 14.5 mmol Na, 3.55 mmol K, and 91 ml H2O.kg body wt-1.24 h-1 were either administered with food at 8:30 A.M. or were continuously infused at 2 consecutive days. During these 3 days, automatized 20-min urine collections, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and heart rate (HR) recordings were performed without disturbing the dogs. Fundamental and partial periodicities, the noise component of urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), MABP, and HR were analyzed using a method derived from Fourier and Cosinor analysis. Oral intake (OI) leads to powerful 24-h periodicities in all dogs and seems to synchronize UNaV. UNaV on OI peaked between 1 and 3 P.M. Under the infusion regimen, signs of nonstationary rhythms and desynchronization predominated. UNaV under the infusion regimen could be separated into two components: a rather constant component continuously excreted and superimposed to this an oscillating component. No direct coupling between UNaV and MABP periodicities could be demonstrated. On OI, an increase in HR seems to advance the peak UNaV in the postprandial period. HR and MABP signals were both superimposed with noise. We conclude that UNaV rhythms are present in dogs. They are considerably more pronounced on OI. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The exact mechanism of this effect is unclear but it is presumed to be a result of ventilatory stimulation. To determine whether the ability to correct arterial blood gas abnormalities by voluntary hyperventilation would predict a subsequent favourable response to progesterone, we studied 11 subjects with chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic hypercapnia. Five subjects had chronic obstructive lung disease of moderate severity with mean (SE) FEV1 1.8 (0.34) 1 maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) 40.4 (7.16) 1/min-1, arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) 53.8 (2.40 mm Hg, and arterial carbon dioxide tension Paco2) 49.6 (3.91) mm Hg, and were able to normalise their blood gas tensions during voluntary hyperventilation (Pao2 85.4 (8.01) mm Hg; Paco2 32.8 (3.43) mm Hg). Six subjects had severe chronic obstructive lung disease with FEV1 0.77 (0.12) 1, MVV 19 (3.09) 1/min-1, Pao2 60.0 (2.89) mm Hg and Paco2 50.5 (1.38) mm Hg, and they could not significantly alter their blood gases with voluntary hyperventilation (Pao2 62.5 (3.19) mm Hg, Paco2 49.7 (1.84) mm Hg). The groups were similar in age, height, weight, and resting Pao2 and Paco2. Each subject received one month of oral placebo and one month of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). 20 mg orally thrice daily, given in a randomised, double blind fashion. The groups responded similarly with a significantly higher Pao2 and lower Paco2 while having medroxyprogesterone acetate than while having placebo. Two patients with polycythaemia showed a reduction in haemoglobin concentration while taking progesterone. It is concluded that the response to medroxyprogesterone is not predictable from spirometric or blood gas changes after voluntary hyperventilation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

When platelet membranes were not washed after preincubation with PAF or PAF antagonists, no significant specific binding of [3H]PAF was observed, which suggests full occupancy of the binding sites. When membranes were extensively washed, full recovery of specific [3H]PAF binding was attained with L 652731 and partial recoveries (60%, 55% and 30%) were reached with BN 52021, WEB 2086 and PAF, respectively; no recovery was seen with the dioxolanes BN 52111 and BN 52115. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that no significant change in the dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) occurred after preincubation of platelet membrane with L 652731, whereas a reduction of Bmax was observed when PAF and BN 52021 were measured. When platelet membranes were preincubated with WEB 2086, Bmax and Kd significantly increased. The data suggest differing binding properties for PAF and the PAF antagonists. Some of the PAF antagonists may tightly bind to the PAF receptor site(s) and/or irreversibly modify or downregulate PAF recognition sites. Our results also suggest that the interaction of PAF receptor antagonists with PAF receptor can be divided into at least two components, namely a reversible component and an irreversible one. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Balb/c mice, bred and reared on an OVA-free diet, received either one dose or 14 consecutive daily intragastric doses of 25 mg OVA/dose. Single dose administration of OVA resulted in significant suppression of total immunoglobulins in the intestinal mucosa, particularly of the IgA isotype, although a very low titre anti-OVA IgG class antibody response was induced. After multiple peroral immunisations, there was more intestinal anti-OVA antibody induction and less suppression of total immunoglobulins. However, all the anti-OVA antibody was of the IgG isotype. In vitro production of mucosal immunoglobulins was not significantly reduced over 5 days, compared with controls, in either single or multiple administration groups, suggestive of a loss of T suppressor cell function in culture. Prior adoptive transfer of splenic and lymph node cells from mice preimmunised with OVA was capable of abrogating the local suppression of immunoglobulin production in vivo. Although adoptive transfer of bovine serum albumin-sensitised cells could also overcome some of the local suppression, complete restoration of normal immunoglobulin levels was not achieved. These data suggest that single oral administration of a novel dietary antigen induces a transient, non-specific suppression of intestinal immunoglobulin production, which can be overcome by antigen-specific T cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

With this in mind, 20 women who had previously responded sub-optimally to standard ovarian stimulation regimens for in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) were recruited into a randomized trial to study the effect of co-treatment with growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo Nordisk Gentofte A/S). Intramuscular injections of growth hormone (24 IU) or placebo were given on alternate days concurrently with the same daily dosage of gonadotrophin as administered in the patient's pretreatment cycle. Overall, there was no improvement in the ovarian response to the growth hormone-augmented regimen of stimulation although there was a tendency for the development of more follicles (P = 0.06). When the results from the patients with ultrasound-diagnosed polycystic ovaries were analysed separately, however, more follicles developed (P = 0.04), more oocytes were collected (P = 0.03) and there was a trend towards higher urinary oestrogen production following growth hormone therapy. There was no improvement in the ovarian response in patients with normal ovaries. The treatment was not associated with any adverse effects. We conclude, therefore, that in a subgroup of patients who respond sub-optimally to standard ovarian stimulation regimens for IVF-ET and who have ultrasound-diagnosed polycystic ovaries, systemic growth hormone is an effective adjunctive therapy. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The following conclusions were made: (1) Both epitopes were thymus-independent and immunogenic and tolerogenic as well. (2) The marked dose differences between the two epitopes with regard to tolerance induction were found to be a consequence of the affinity and the heterogeneity of the responding B cells as well as the epitope density employed for detecting the PFC in a predictable way. (3) The alpha 1-6 response, in contrast to the anti-FITC response, was homogeneous and of low affinity and the number of precursor B cells was low. (4) Different mouse strains were found to be high-, low- or non-responders to alpha 1-6, but all the strains tested responded to the FITC epitope coupled to dextran. (5) Dextran and FITC-dextran were polyclonal B cell activators in the strains tested, irrespective of their ability to respond to the alpha 1-6 epitope. The findings indicate that epitope density and mol. wt of the immunogen as well as Ig receptor affinity for the epitope on the B cells are variables which markedly influence the binding of the immunogen to the specific B cells and therefore affect the delivery of the non-specific triggering signal. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Moreover, experimentally induced global enrichment of corneal gangliosides favors angiogenesis. The objective of this work was to explain the possible relationship between angiogenic response and changes in the GM3:GD3 ratios observed in vivo. Cornea was utilized because it is avascular and transparent; i.e., the onset of opacity permitted exclusion of angiogenesis produced by a generic inflammatory response. Prostaglandin E1 or basic fibroblast growth factor were applied as angiogenesis triggers. Angiogenesis in vivo and mobilization and growth of microvascular endothelium in vitro were taken as parameters to indicate whether differences in GM3:GD3 ratios could modify the extent of the angiogenic response. In vivo angiogenesis, whether prostaglandin E1 or basic fibroblast growth factor induced, was repressed by GM3 and enhanced by GD3 or GM1 enrichment of the cornea. In vitro growth and motility of microvascular endothelium were reduced by GM3 addition to the medium and returned to normal levels by addition of GD3. Formation of new vessels induced by two different angiogenic factors could be stimulated or repressed in the cornea by reduction or enhancement of the GM3:GD3 ratio of tissue gangliosides. Changes in the relative proportion of molecules normally present in adult tissues, like prostaglandin E1, basic fibroblast growth factor, GM3, GD3, were sufficient to modulate or even block angiogenesis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The greater part of peritoneal fluid protein is transported in both ascites and under normal conditions by the lymphatics of the right side. The excess protein filtered from the liver sinusoids in venous stasis is transported by the thoracic duct. In this condition large amounts of fluid accumulate in the lymphatics in consequence of a relative obstacle to outflow at the veno-lymphatic junction. Thoracic duct drainage in experimental ascites leads to large fluid and protein losses and consequently to a reduction of inferior caval pressure and of capillary filtration in the liver. The intervention reduces ascites formation but does not influence the lymphatic absorption and transport of peritoneal fluid. Consequently, it is indicated only as a temporary measure, a preliminary to portocaval shunt operation, to reduce the increased sinusoidal and portal pressures. A cervical lympho-venous anastomosis reduces thoracic duct pressure by eliminating the obstacle to lymph flow. Accordingly, the intervention facilitates the return of excess lymph into the blood stream, and reduces fluid and protein leakage into the abdominal cavity from the liver. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In addition, messenger RNA'S Were extracted from total, free, and membrane-bound placental polyribosomes and their capacities for hPL and hCG synthesis were measured in a heterologous cell-free system prepared from wheat germ. Membrane-bound polyribosomes from full term placentas were several times more active in the synthesis of both peptide hormones than were free polyribosomes. By binding 125I-labeled hPL antibody to nascent chains on the polyribosomes, it was determined that hPL is made by clusters of seven to nine ribosomes. About 8% of the nascent peptide chains released by incubation of polyribosomes from full term placentas was accounted for by hPL, and 2% by hCG. In contrast, no chains of hPL were released by polyribosomes from 10-week placentas, whereas 11% of the total released chains were accounted for by hCG. When messenger RNAs prepared from the polyribosomes of 20- and 40-week placentas were used to stimulate protein synthesis in a wheat germ system, hPL accounted for 0.4 and 2%, respectively, of total protein synthesis, while hCG was 8 and 2%, respectively. This confirmed the relative proportions observed for nascent chains on the polyribosomes of early and late placentas. Unexpectedly, translation of mRNA from free polyribosomes yielded as much hPL and two-thirds as much hCG as did translation of mRNA from bound polyribosomes. We conclude, that the decreased blood levels of hCG and increased blood levels of hPL with advancing gestational age reflect the relative in vitro rates of synthesis of these hormones by placental polyribosomes, the abundance of which is determined by availability of their respective messenger RNAs at different times in gestation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In all, ME 2303 was more effective than doxorubicin except one of stomach cancer. The histopathological findings also revealed that 35 mg/kg of ME 2303 was equal or slightly superior to doxorubicin in efficacy. The side effects of ME 2303 such as weight loss were as mild as those with doxorubicin, except in the female mice administered 30 mg/kg of ME 2303 and no other adverse effect was observed.

Another patient with pigment gallstones, sickle cell disease (SS), and stable jaundice was studied to examine the mechanism by which an increased bilirubin load was excreted. Total bilirubin was almost entirely conjugated and excretion was related linearly to bile salt excretion PS and CS subjects; one-third of bilirubin excretion was bile salt independent and two-thirds was bile salt associated. In the SS patient 90% of the bilirubin excretion was independent of bile salt output. In PS and CS patients, bilirubin output was linearly related to bile flow, but the SS patient showed significant bilirubin excretion at low flow rates. CS and PS patients had similar patterns of bilirubin excretion, but the increased bilirubin load in the SS patient was excreted independently of bile salts. In the SS patient, unconjugated bilirubin output was hyperbolically related to bile salts output and represented a maximum of 3% of the total bilirubin output. The bile salt-independent excretion of conjugated bilirubin suggests that micelles were not required for transport into bile; whereas the hyperbolic relationship for unconjugated bilirubin and bile salt output, similar to that of the micellar lipids. cholesterol, and phospholipids, suggests interaction with micelles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In 26 eyes, the RPE overlying the tumor was morphologically normal or atrophic; in 18 eyes, hyperplastic changes were present. Normal RPE cells lacked vimentin, but it was present in 35 of 44 eyes with uveal melanoma. Antibodies that recognize cytokeratins CK8 and CK18 labeled normal and reactive RPE cells in all specimens. Although CAM 5.2 and CY-90 detected RPE cells strongly and quantitatively, clones CK5, KS-B17.2, and pancytokeratin antibody lu-5 reacted weakly and did not label some specimens. Immunoblotting supported the presence of CK8 and CK18 in human RPE. Normal RPE cells did not express other simple epithelial cytokeratins, but both atrophic and hyperplastic reactive RPE cells were labeled with antibodies to CK7 or CK19 in 24 of the 44 eyes. Hyperplastic proliferating RPE cells that formed subretinal membranes reacted positively for alpha-smooth muscle actin in 13 of 18 eyes. Antibodies to CK8 and CK18 are valuable markers of normal and reactive human RPE cells, but a panel of reagents is necessary to document reactive changes in the cytoskeleton.

The result has been large quantities of data which, when compared, produce inconsistencies which cannot be resolved without additional data from different studies. Yet, a tentative explanation of ER growth can be presented if the question of why people use ERs, which is usually thought of as being similar to the question of why people use medical care services, is restated as, why do people who want to use medical care choose the ER as the site of care? That question can best be answered by paying greater attention to enabling and illness factors than to the predisposing demographic factors upon which much research has focused.

The concentration of oestradiol began to rise 12-14 h before the onset of oestrus from values of 11-2 +/- 0-36 (S.E.M.) pg/ml during the luteal phase to 21-1 +/- 2-01 pg/ml at -8 to 0 h (oestrus). There was no distinct increase during the luteal phase. Circulating progesterone varied in a cyclic manner with the highest values at the mid-luteal phase (3-70 +/- 0-28 ng/ml; n = 28). In five out of six ewes the concentration was still quite high (1-86 +/- 0-43 ng/ml) at 35 h before the onset of oestrus. The concentration declined rapidly thereafter, reaching minimum values about 12 h before oestrus coincident with the increase in oestradiol concentration. Plasma LH increased from very low values of 2-59 +/- 0-09 ng/ml during the luteal phase to 75-3 +/- 7-4 ng/ml about 9 h after the onset of oestrus. Two peaks of plasma FSH concentration were detected after the onset of oestrus. The first peak (171-0 +/- 35-5 ng/ml) coincided with the LH peak and the second (133-0 +/- 10-7 ng/ml) occurred about 24 h later at a time when LH values were low. The mean FSH concentration at other times during the cycle was 61-9 +/- 2-8 ng/ml. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To detect changes in these components during a mirthful laughter experience, the authors studied 10 healthy male subjects. Five experimental subjects viewed a 60 minute humor video and five control subjects did not. Serial blood samples were measured for corticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, beta-endorphin, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac)--the major serum neuronal catabolite of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and prolactin. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that cortisol and dopac in the experimental group decreased more rapidly from baseline than the control group (p = 0.011, p = 0.025, respectively). Epinephrine levels in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control at all time points (p = 0.017). Growth hormone levels in the experimental group significantly increased during baseline (p = 0.027) and then decreased with laughter intervention (p less than 0.0005), whereas, the controls did not change over time (p = 0.787). ACTH, beta-endorphin, prolactin, and norepinephrine levels did not significantly increase. The mirthful laughter experience appears to reduce serum levels of cortisol, dopac, epinephrine, and growth hormone. These biochemical changes have implications for the reversal of the neuroendocrine and classical stress hormone response. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There were no significant side effects. Cortex-to-target muscle latencies measured 20.2 +/- 1.6 ms (thenar), 14.2 +/- 1.7 ms (extensor digitorum communis), 9.4 +/- 1.7 ms (biceps), and 27.2 +/- 2.9 ms (tibialis anterior). Central motor delay between the cortex and the C-7 and L-5 measured 6.7 +/- 1.2 ms and 13.1 +/- 3.8 ms, respectively. Mean spinal cord motor conduction velocity measured 65.4 m/s. MEP amplitude expressed as a percentage of the maximum M wave was never less than 20% of the M wave. A value of less than 10% is considered abnormal. MEP latency increases linearly with age and central motor delay is longer in older subjects. Compound muscle action potentials and absolute MEP amplitudes decreased linearly with age. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MEP latency and central delay were often very prolonged. The MEP was more sensitive than the SEP in MS. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MEP latencies were only modestly prolonged; the characteristic abnormality was reduced amplitude. When pseudobulbar features predominated MEPs were often absent. The MEP was of normal latency in Parkinson's disease, but age-related amplitude was often increased. MEP latency and amplitude were normal in Huntington's disease. Abnormal MEPs persisted several months after stroke despite good functional recovery. The MEP could be used to advantage to demonstrate proximal conduction slowing and block in demyelinating neuropathies. In plexopathy, ability to elicit an MEP several days after onset of paresis was good evidence of neuronal continuity in motor fibers. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Thirty-two healthy adults were vaccinated once or twice with a conjugate (PRP-D) consisting of Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (PRP) and diphtheria toxoid (DT), and the response was related to the prevaccination levels of PRP and DT antibodies. Positive correlations were found between increases in plasma PRP (median, 32.0 micrograms/ml) and DT (1.14 IU/ml) antibodies and numbers of circulating PRP and DT antibody-secreting cells (AbSC) (postvaccination days 6 to 9). The B-cell responses (antibody response and AbSC) to both PRP and DT correlated positively with prevaccination levels of anti-DT. DT AbSC appeared earlier (peak, day 7) than PRP AbSC (peak, day 8). Individuals whose PRP AbSC peaked early (day 7) had higher prevaccination anti-DT levels than those who peaked later (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the prevaccination levels of anti-PRP did not correlate significantly with the magnitude of the antibody or AbSC response and did not affect the kinetics of the AbSC. Following revaccination with PRP-D, small increases in the level of PRP antibodies (median, 2.9 micrograms/ml; n = 11) were found; no significant increase in the level of DT antibodies was seen. The numbers of PRP AbSC were lower (P = 0.04) and peaked earlier (day 7) than after the first vaccination. The isotype pattern of PRP AbSC, which was dominated by immunoglobulin A (IgA) after the first vaccination, now showed a more equal distribution between IgG and IgA AbSC. It is concluded that after immunization with PRP-D both the magnitude and the kinetics of the antipolysaccharide B-cell response are influenced by prevaccination immunity to the carrier molecule. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The cohort was notable for a high failure rate at the university preclinical examination, but this failure rate did not reappear consistently in all four final clinical subjects. The assaying examinations were not only valid for their objectives, but also measured a range of other attributes. Multiple choice question papers scores detect both quantitative and qualitative differences in knowledge between the high and low fail risk candidates. The effect of A-level grade is variable but is carried up to the final qualifying examinations. High performers tend to have good A-levels. The contribution of the preclinical course to the clinical qualifying examination was small, varied between the preclinical subjects and also between the clinical subjects and two streams of students. It is shown that lack of an adequate standard in science subjects before entry to university is associated with subsequent disadvantage in clinical training. Such disadvantage could be reduced by an introductory premedical course. The contributions made by the differing educational experiences within the cohort could be detected in many of the examinations; in particular, poor performance at the end of first clinical year pathology multiple choice questions paper examination was associated with poor performance at finals. Failure in the first part of finals indicated a likelihood of furhter failure, factors such as sex and motivation are shown to affect multiple choice question performance whilst others such as work overload do not. The high risk fail candidates can be detected 2 years before finals and might be given special educational treatment designed to improve their chance of first time success as there is no efficient way of identifying them before acceptance into the medical school. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results obtained with various techniques (evaluation of gross morphology, measurement of diameter, thymidine incorporation, light and electron microscopy) led basically to the same conclusions. Embryos being asynchronously transferred to the uterus of recipient rabbits survived, at least in terms of certain cellular functions like cell proliferation, for more than 2 days. Development, however, was clearly retarded and ultrastructural examination revealed substantial cell damage. Some blastocysts showed, even after 3 days, normal growth and cell proliferation indicating considerable differences between individuals in the ability to compensate for suboptimal developmental conditions before implantation. In general, this ability was greater in the transferred Day-3 morulae than in the Day-4 blastocysts. Embryonic growth and the ability to dissolve the zona pellucida, to synthesize crystalloid bodies and to differentiate extraembryonic endoderm indicated the maintenance of some developmental functions under asynchronous conditions. Blastocyst development was influenced by the progestational stage of the recipient. At 1 day after transfer into asynchronous older uteri, blastocyst diameters were larger and cell proliferation was increased compared with all other groups, suggesting an attempt of the blastocyst to adjust to the more advanced maternal milieu. Development in asynchronous younger uteri was delayed. No comparable differences in development were found in cultured embryos for which the media had been supplemented with flushings from the same progestational uterine stages as used for transfer. Thymidine incorporation in cultured embryos did not differ between the various supplements (P greater than 0.05) and was generally lower than in chronologically aged asynchronously transferred embryos (P less than 0.05 for Day-3 and P less than 0.001 or P greater than 0.05 for Day-4 embryos). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This paper focuses on the effect of freezing sperm in liquid nitrogen, extensively used in artificial insemination (AI), combined with different sperm manipulations (washing, swim-up in capacitating medium, CM) using flow and image cytometry on sperm samples from three fertile donors. Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) uptake profiles were bimodal both for fresh and frozen/thawed samples. The mean value of fluorescence of active cells (m+) remained nearly similar after freezing while the percentage of active cells (%C+) was significantly decreased and the percentage of dead cells (%dc, revealed by propidium iodide uptake) significantly increased. In all experiments, the decrease of MOT (percentage of motile sperm) due to freezing was concomitant, to a smaller extent, with a drop in %C+ and an increase in %dc; there was a good relationship between velocity (VCL, VSL) or trajectory characteristics (ALH) and the mean fluorescence values of active cells (m+). Sperm immobilization was neither found related to a major decrease of Rh123 fluorescence nor to an increase in dead cells. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Lidocaine was administered to the donor as an intravenous injection of 0.5 to 2.0 mg. per kilogram or as an intravenous infusion of 4 to 50 mug per kilogram per minute and plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. At plasma lidocaine concentrations from 0.2 to 9.9 mug per milliliter no significant changes in donor arterial pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiographic P-R and QRS intervals occurred, and Purkinje fiber resting membrane potential was unchanged. Donor Q-T intervals were unchanged at lower lidocaine concentrations (up to 4.0 mug per milliliter) and decreased at higher levels (4.1 to 9.9 mug per milliliter). Purkinje fiber AP changes commenced in 2 to 3 minutes of lidocaine injection. At lower lidocaine levels AP amplitude, maximum slope of phase 0 depolarization (Vmax) AP duration, and effective refractory period decreased, membrane responsiveness was depressed, and automaticity of spontaneously firing Purkinje fibers decreased. These changes were accentuated at higher lidocaine concentrations. Conduction usually was unchanged or slowed at lower plasma lidocaine levels and slowed at higher concentrations. When ouabain-intoxicated preparations were studied, lidocaine exerted a depressant effect on the AP. These studies indicate that the mechanisms whereby therapeutic lidocaine concentrations may modify arrhythmias are not unlike those of other local anesthetics and include depression of Vmax, membrane responsiveness, and conduction. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This can be done by considering the protein as a \"solvent\" for its redox center and calculating the difference between the electrostatic energy of the reduced and oxidized heme. Such calculations are presented here, applying the protein dipoles-Langevin dipoles (PDLD) model to cytochrome c. The calculations focus on an evaluation of the difference between the redox potentials of cytochrome c and the octapeptide-methionine complex formed by hydrolysis of cytochrome c. The corresponding difference (approximately 7 kcal/mol) is accounted for by the PDLD calculations. It is found that the protein provides basically a low dielectric environment for the heme, which destabilizes the oxidized heme (relative to its energy in water). The effect of the charged propionic acids on the heme is examined in a preliminary way. It is found that the negative charges of these groups are in a hydrophilic rather than a hydrophobic environment and that the protein-water system provides an effective high dielectric constant for their interaction with the heme. The dual nature of the dielectric effect of the cytochrome (a low dielectric constant for the self-energy of the heme and a high dielectric constant for charge-charge interactions) is discussed. The findings of this work are consistent with the difference between the folding energies of the reduced and oxidized cytochrome c. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two features commonly shared among this group of proteins are the presence of two pairs of cysteines, generally found in the N-terminal region of the extracellular domain, and a WSxWS (WS) motif, frequently located proximal to the transmembrane domain. We have recently shown the 4 cysteines to be critical to the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the PRL-receptor. In the present study, we prepared a set of eight chimeric rat PRL/human GH receptors and several alanine mutants, to assess the importance of the Cys-rich domain (residues 12-68) in confering specificity to PRL binding. The role of the WS motif in high affinity binding was also investigated. Binding of 125I-labeled ovine PRL or human GH to membrane preparations from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the mutant receptors have defined a region within the first disulfide loop (residues Arg13, Asp16, Glu18) and the set of lactogen-specific sequences between the two pairs of cysteines as key determinants of PRL-binding specificity, which converge to form a patch on a two-dimensional model of the PRL receptor. We also demonstrate that, although PRL- and GH-specific determinants overlap in certain areas, they are not identical. Finally, substitution of the WS motif with alanine residues precludes high affinity binding to ovine PRL and human GH and suggests that this structural element may provide a target site for the interaction of an accessory protein necessary for the formation of a high-affinity receptor complex. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We compared in vitro endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-precontracted muscular pulmonary arteries (PA) from pigs aged 5 min to 2 h (neonatal), 3-10 days, 3-8 weeks and adults. 2. In the pulmonary artery (PA) rings from neonatal animals, the vasodilator response to ACh was negligible. However, responses to ACh were present in all PA rings from older animals, being greatest at 3-10 days and then decreasing with age (P less than 0.001, ANOVA). ACh (30 microM) induced a 1 +/- 1%, 92 +/- 9%, 62 +/- 5% and 51 +/- 6% reduction of the PGF2 alpha-generated tension in neonatal, 3-10 days, 3-8 weeks and adult groups, respectively. 3. The relaxant response to SNP was present in the PA rings from all age groups and increased with age (P less than 0.001, ANOVA). SNP (1 microM)-induced relaxation was 55 +/- 9%, 73 +/- 7%, 97 +/- 5% and 93 +/- 6% in neonatal, 3-10 days, 3-8 week and adult groups, respectively. 4. Removal of the vascular endothelium abolished the relaxant response to ACh but had no effect on the response to SNP in any groups. 5. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (30 microM), a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, inhibited the response to ACh but not to SNP. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, had no significant effect on responses to ACh or SNP in any group.6. These findings suggest that the nitric oxide pathway may not play a part in dilating the pig pulmonary arteries at birth, but may be important during the transitional period of establishing a stable post-natal pulmonary circulation. The increase in response to SNP with age parallels the increase in smooth muscle cell myofilaments to which it may be related. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Adult male and female canaries were pretreated with [3H]thymidine to label cells undergoing DNA synthesis prior to mitosis. Thirty or 60 days later, neurons in a forebrain nucleus, hyperstriatium ventralis, pars caudalis (HVc), were labeled by retrograde transport of HRP injected into the only two nuclei known to receive a projection from HVc: robustus archistriatalis (RA) and area X of lobus parolfactorius. The birds were then killed and brain sections were treated to visualize cells containing HRP; these sections were processed for autoradiography to detect [3H]thymidine-labeled cells in the same tissue. More than 9% of all neurons in HVc were thymidine labeled; but of the almost 20,000 HRP-labeled projection neurons examined, fewer than 20 (0.1%) were labeled by the thymidine treatment. Furthermore, the median cell body size for area X-projecting cells was significantly larger than that of thymidine-labeled cells, and the median size of thymidine-labeled cells was significantly larger than that of RA-projecting cells. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the new neurons incorporated into nucleus HVc in adult canary brain are local interneurons, intermediate in size between neurons projecting to RA and area X. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

As early as 2 months of age, the activity of T-helper (Th) cells ('Th2'-like) in the in vitro primary antibody response was profoundly impaired, in contrast to normal activity of Th cells ('Th1'-like) engaged in cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, young SAM-P/1 mice show a functional heterogeneity of Th cells. To determine how such a 'Th2' abnormality is inherited in SAM-P/1 mice, immune activities of their hybrids and backcrosses between MHC-identical, high responder B10.BR mice were statistically assessed. The distribution of responses did not support the Mendelian single-gene determination for low responsiveness. Moreover, involvement of a single gene which exhibits incomplete dominance was ruled out because of a continuous distribution pattern of antibody response in the F2 generation. Such an analysis strongly suggests that the impaired 'Th2'-like activity of SAM-P/1 mice is under control of two genes, based on the proportion of low responders in F2 hybrids (29 out of 267, 10.8%) and on calculation according to Wright's formula (n = 1.72). Further linkage analyses suggest that one of the genes is closely linked to albino coat-colour (c) locus on chromosome 7. The putative two genes are likely to control 'differentiation' or 'maturation' of Th2-like cells defectively, but the defect is not refractory, because in vivo-primed Th cells function in vitro as do those in ordinary strains of mice. Possible mechanisms and biological significance in relation to loss of immune activity with ageing are discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The tape-recorded EEG was filtered at 1-25 c/sec, and 128 individual responses were summed, sampling every 0.5 msec for 250 msec post-stimulation. The Cz AERs showed the classic vertex response, a negative peak, N1, at 100 msec, followed by a positive peak, P2, at 160-200 msec. The T3 and T4 AERs were similar to the Cz AERs from 0 to 80 msec and from 200 to 250 msec. They differed significantly from the Cz AERs from 80 to 200 msec. The difference is best explained by the hypothesis that the Cz AERs consisted of N1P2, while the T3 and T4 AERs consisted of N1P2 plus an additional superimposed component, which we called the T complex, comprising a positive peak, Ta, at 105-110 msec, and a negative peak, Tb, at 150-160 msec. By computer, the corresponding Cz and T3 or T4 AERs were normalized to equalize their amplitudes, and the former was subtracted from the latter, thus isolating the T complex. The Ta peak was found to occur 1.5 +/- 1.6 msec earlier at the electrode contralateral to stimulation, and 2.2 +/- 4.0 msec earlier at the T4 (right) electrode. Both differences were statistically significant. The T complex amplitude was greater at the electrode contralateral to stimulation and at the T4 electrode. These findings appear to resolve current controversies concerning the form of the temporal AER. While N1P2 is apparently a product of widespread areas of cortex, we conclude that the T complex is probably a product of secondary auditory cortex. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Utilizing a highly characterized monoclonal antibody library we employed ELISA, Western blot, immunocytochemical, and MHC epitope mapping techniques to determine which MHCs were present in the fibers of these muscles at different stages of development. The developmental pattern of MHC expression in the normal bicep brachii was uniform with all fibers initially accumulating embryonic MHC similar to that of the pectoralis muscle. At hatching the neonatal isoform was expressed in all fibers; however, unlike in the pectoralis muscle the embryonic MHC isoform did not disappear. With increasing age the neonatal MHC was repressed leaving the embryonic MHC as the only detectable isoform present in the adult bicep brachii muscle. While initially expressing embryonic MHC in ovo, the post-hatch normal gastrocnemius expressed both embryonic and neonatal MHCs. However, unlike the bicep brachii muscle, this pattern of expression continued in the adult muscle. The adult normal gastrocnemius stained heterogeneously with anti-embryonic and anti-neonatal antibodies indicating that mature fibers could contain either isoform or both. Neither the bicep brachii muscle nor the lateral gastrocnemius muscle reacted with the adult specific antibody at any stage of development. In the developing posterior latissimus dorsi muscle (PLD), embryonic, neonatal, and adult isoforms sequentially appeared; however, expression of the embryonic isoform continued throughout development. In the adult PLD, both embryonic and adult MHCs were expressed, with most fibers expressing both isoforms. In dystrophic neonates and adults virtually all fibers of the bicep brachii, gastrocnemius, and PLD muscles were identical and contained embryonic and neonatal MHCs. These results corroborate previous observations that there are alternative programs of fast MHC expression to that found in the pectoralis muscle of the chicken (M.T. Crow and F.E. Stockdale, 1986, Dev. Biol. 118, 333-342), and that diversification into fibers containing specific MHCs fails to occur in the fast muscle fibers of the dystrophic chicken. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that avian muscular dystrophy is a developmental disorder that is associated with alterations in isoform switching during muscle maturation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Bolus injections of norepinephrine (3-100 nmol) induced dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure with a maximum increase greater than 100 mm Hg. In the same dose range, clonidine had no effect on perfusion pressure. In the presence of an elevated pressure caused by constant infusions of norepinephrine (6-20 microM), bolus injections of clonidine (0.1-10 nmol) or acetylcholine (0.007-7 nmol) caused dose-related decreases in perfusion pressure. Procedures which damage endothelium (brief exposure to methylene blue or reactive oxygen radicals) abolished the depressor action of acetylcholine but only moderately reduced the depressor action of clonidine. The depressor action of clonidine was not antagonized by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan. Acetylcholine produced depressor responses in the presence of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine or vasopressin, but clonidine did not. Dose-response curves to bolus doses of norepinephrine were shifted markedly to the right by an alpha-1 selective concentration of prazosin (1 nM) and were shifted to the right with depression of maximum by infusions of clonidine (0.3 and 1.0 microM). It is concluded that, in the mesenteric vasculature of the rat: 1) the role of alpha-2 adrenoceptors, in responses to clonidine, is minimal; 2) endothelial factors play little role, if any, in the depressor effects of clonidine and 3) clonidine has a potent ability to interfere with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction induced by norepinephrine. This antagonistic action may be at the level of the receptor but could involve postreceptor steps. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These include ischemic preservation and immunologic injury as well as the division of intestinal lymphatics during transplantation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the recovery of fat absorption in transplanted small bowel in syngeneic rats. Orthotopic transplantation of the total small bowel with resection of the native intestine was performed. The experimental (n = 11) and a pair-fed, sham-operated control (n = 8) groups were fed a 50% kcal corn oil semipurified diet. Studies of cyclosporine (CSA) absorption, maltose absorption, dietary fat, and fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin (FA1AT) excretion in transplanted animals were performed preoperatively and at 15, 30, and 50 days postoperatively. There was no significant difference in the weight change or fat and maltose absorption in experimental animals compared with control animals at any time point. Peak serum CSA levels were lower at day 15 in transplanted animals than in controls (P = 0.006) and improved but remained lower than those in controls at days 30 and 50 (P = 0.017).

During each session, a single dose of MOR sulfate (0, 5 and 10 mg/70 kg) was administered i.v. in combination with a single dose of COC hydrochloride (0, 8, 16 and 32 mg/70 kg). All possible COC-MOR combinations were each tested once. Measures of subjective effects were obtained repeatedly, heart rate, diastolic and systolic blood pressure were sampled every 2 min and blood levels of COC and MOR were obtained at three time points. Both COC and MOR alone significantly increased peak heart rate, diastolic pressure and systolic pressure. The cardiovascular effects of COC were larger and longer in duration than morphine, as indicated by larger area under the curve measures compared to MOR. COC alone increased visual analog scales ratings of \"stimulated\" and A scores of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, whereas MOR alone increased opiate symptoms and ratings of \"sedated\" and both drugs increased ratings of \"high.\" For the most part, the cardiovascular effects of COC-MOR combinations could be predicted by the effects of COC alone, and the subjective effects of the combinations could be predicted by either drug alone. The drug combination produced increases in cardiovascular and subjective effects that were less than predicted by an effect addition model of drug interaction. The disposition of both COC and MOR was unaffected by the presence of the other drug. These results suggest that the self-administration of this drug combination may be related to a unique profile of opiate and stimulant effects instead of an alteration in the effects produced by either drug alone. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Gentamicin (GM), one such antibiotic, was taken up until the cellular concentration reached an estimated 64 mM on the 3rd day when cells were incubated with 2 mM gentamicin. The rate of release of intracellular GM was high on the first day of incubation and gradually slowed down over the next 4 d. About 50% of the GM remained in the cells even on longer incubation in GM-free medium, suggesting it may irreversibly bind to cellular components. With myeloid body formation, the cellular phospholipid content increased 1.5 times. Bis(monoacyl-glyceryl)phosphate, which is known as a marker of lysosomal phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine showed 250, 162, and 153% increases, respectively. Sphingomyelin was not accumulated, while lysosomal sphingomyelinase was dramatically inhibited. Of 12 different aminoglycoside antibiotics, paromomycin is the most prominent myeloid body-forming antibiotic. The myeloid body-formation is not directly correlated to human nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, the number of myeloid bodies is well correlated to the affinity to the brush border membrane, suggesting that such aminoglycoside antibiotics are taken up easily through cellular endocytosis. The cytotoxic effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics may be due to by their binding to cellular organelles other than lysosomes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

LY was effective within a very narrow range of drug concentrations (from 0.125 to 2.0 micrograms/ml) and was more active than other agents tested against S. faecalis. Enhanced inhibition of S. faecalis was seen more frequently with combinations of either penicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside than with combinations of LY and gentamicin, imipenem, or ceftriaxone. The in vivo efficacy of LY was compared with that of vancomycin and ampicillin alone and combinations of vancomycin-gentamicin, ampicillin-gentamicin, and LY-gentamicin in a rat model of chronic enterococcal pyelonephritis. At a dose of 10 mg/kg given twice daily, LY reduced the number of organisms per kidney significantly compared with that in infected untreated controls within 48 h after the initiation of therapy. At 20 mg/kg given once a day, LY was less effective but reduced colony counts significantly after 4 days of therapy, and its activity was comparable to that of vancomycin or vancomycin-gentamicin given twice daily.

These 35S-cysteine-labeled proteins in the SON (1-24 h after injection) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the distribution of radioactive proteins on the gels was analyzed. 1 h after injection, about 73% of the radioactivity appeared in two peaks (both about 20,000 mol wt). With time, these peaks (putative precursors of neurophysin) decreased, as a 12,000 mol wt peak (containing two distinct neurophysins) increased in radioactivity. Both the 20,000- and 12,000-mol wt proteins are transported into the axonal (median eminence) and nerve terminal (posterior pituitary) regions of the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. Conversion of the larger precursor protein to the smaller neurophysin appears to occur, in large part, intra-axonally during axonal transport. Six distinct 35S-cysteine-labeled peptides (less than 2500 mol wt), in addition to arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, are also synthesized in the SON and transported to the posterior pituitary where they are released together with labeled neurophysin by potassium depolarization in the presence of extracellular calcium. These data provide support for the hypothesis that the neurohypophysial peptides (vasopressin and oxytocin) and neurophysins are derived from the post-translational clevage of protein precursors synthesized in the SON, and that the conversion process can occur in the neurosecretory granule during axonal transport. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In rat and rabbit, the P-450 form 2E1 is a predominant low-KM, high-rate catalyst of HFC-134a biotransformation and is prominently involved in the metabolism of other tetrahaloalkanes of greater toxicity than HFC-134a [e.g. 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b)]. In this study, we determined that the human ortholog of P-450 2E1 plays a role of similar importance in the metabolism of HFC-134a. In human hepatic microsomes from 12 individuals, preparations from subjects with relatively high P-450 2E1 levels were shown to metabolize HFC-134a at rates 5- to 10-fold greater than microsomes of individuals with lower levels of this enzyme; the increased rate of metabolism of HFC-134a was specifically linked to increased expression of P-450 2E1. The primary evidence for this conclusion is drawn from studies using mechanism-based inactivation of P-450 2E1 by diethyldithiocarbamate, competitive inhibition of HFC-134a oxidation by p-nitrophenol (a high-affinity substrate for P-450 2E1), strong positive correlation of rates of HFC-134a defluorination with p-nitrophenol hydroxylation in the study population, and correlation of P-450 2E1 levels with rates of halocarbon oxidation. Thus, our findings support the conclusion that human metabolism of HFC-134a is qualitatively similar to that of the species (rat and rabbit) used for toxicological assessment of this halocarbon.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Starting with published data derived mainly from hippocampal slice preparations, we have used computer-modeling techniques to study hippocampal pyramidal cells (HPCs). 2. The dendrites of the HPC apparently have a short electrotonic length. Calcium spikes are apparently generated by a voltage-dependent mechanism whose kinetics are slow in comparison with those generating sodium spikes of the soma. Inward calcium currents are assumed to trigger a long-lasting potassium conductance. This slow calcium-potassium system, which in our model is located predominantly on the dendrites, provides a heuristic model to describe the mechanism for a) the after-depolarization following an HPC soma (sodium) spike, b) the long afterhyperpolarization following repetitive firing, c) bursts of spikes that sometimes occur after orthodromic or antidromic stimulation, and d) the buildup of the \"depolarizing shift\" during the strong synaptic input presumed to occur during seizures. 3. Fast prepotentials or d-spikes are shown to arise most probably from dendritic \"hot spots\" of sodium-regenerative membrane. The limited amplitude and short duration of these prepotentials imply that the hot spots are located on small dendrites. 4. Dendritic electroresponsiveness, first postulated for the HPC by Spencer and Kandel (52), is analyzed quantitatively here and is shown to provide rich integrative possibilities for this cell. Our model suggests that, for these nerve cells, alterations in specific membrane properties, particularly calcium electroresponsiveness, can lead to bursting behavior that resembles epileptogenic neuronal responses. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Besides covalently binding to DNA, acrolein can inactivate critical proteins necessary for replicative DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, cell membrane integrity, and metabolism of xenobiotic and endogenous substrates. Because enzymatic processes are involved in sister chromatid exchange (SCE) formation and DNA excision repair, we hypothesized that acrolein might modulate SCE induction by PM due to acrolein's high binding affinity for proteins and low molecular weight sulfhydryl compounds. Human mononuclear leukocytes were isolated on a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient, and 10(6) cells were inoculated into 1.9 ml of complete medium. T-cells were stimulated to grow with 4 micrograms concanavalin A/ml, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (5 microM) was added 24 h later. The cultures were then treated with PM (0.069 microM) in the absence or presence of diethyl-4'-hydroperoxy-CP (DEHP-CP), an activated acrolein-generating compound, at concentrations of 0.1, 1, or 10 microM for 48 h. Demecolcine (1.35 microM) was added for the final 4 h of culture. PM alone induced about a 2-fold increase in the SCE frequency (PM, 14.1 +/- 0.5 (SD) versus control, 7.7 +/- 0.4) without cell cycle inhibition or reduced mitotic activity. DEHP-CP induced a concentration-related increase in the SCE frequency of up to 1.6-fold without any significant cell cycle inhibition or lowered mitotic activity. When PM and DEHP-CP were combined, SCE induction was additive for all three DEHP-CP concentrations. Except at the highest molar ratio of DEHP-CP:PM (145:1), there was no evidence of cytotoxicity in the other treatment groups. These results suggest that acrolein has a diminished role in mediating the cytogenetic and cytotoxic effects of CP. In addition, enzymes associated with SCE formation and, by inference, DNA excision repair may not be particularly susceptible to acrolein-induced inactivation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The importance, in a malaria-endemic area, of protection by a malaria vaccine against disease rather than infection is emphasized, and the ways by which disease prevention may be achieved are discussed. Mechanisms of production and presentation of vaccines are considered, including the importance of appropriate and more effective adjuvants. The variety of immune responses to malaria is set out and linked to both human and plasmodial genetic factors. Host genetics may also modify susceptibility to malaria through mechanisms which are not immunological. There is a need for entomological studies of the Anopheles vectors, especially but not only in preparation for transmission-blocking vaccines. This overall complexity justifies a multidimensional approach to epidemiology and field-site preparation. An iterative procedure is proposed for initial field evaluation, through adult male volunteers to community studies in immune adults and then to semi-immune school children, before evaluation in the principal target population of nonimmune young children. The outcome variables for epidemiological evaluation are specified. After this brief review of malaria vaccines, the baseline studies being undertaken by the Malaria Vaccine Epidemiology and Evaluation Project of the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research in the Wosera area of East Sepik Province are discussed in some detail, and their rationale linked to the range and complexity of the malaria vaccines that have been reviewed.

The origin of the amyloid beta protein (A beta P) that accumulates in senile plaques continues to be highly controversial. Recently, using quantitative immunohistochemistry and computerized image analysis, we obtained evidence that at least a subset of early (\"diffuse\") senile plaques originate from neurons. In the current investigation, we employed monoclonal antibodies to A beta P and the same computerized methodology to examine in further detail the quantitative patterns of A beta P deposition in diffuse plaques in a population of intellectually intact elderly individuals. The presence of neurocentric concentration gradients of A beta P accumulation was confirmed in this study. Most significantly, this was the most predominant pattern of early amyloid deposition in the population studied. The highest concentration of A beta P was centered around neuronal cell bodies or their processes, and occasionally along neuronal plasma membranes. Computerized images showed patterns that can be interpreted as a pathogenetic sequence ranging from initial neurogenic concentration gradients centered around one single neuron to larger deposits (diffuse plaques) composed of several \"anastomosing\" gradients involving several adjacent neurons. It is proposed that the described very early deposits constitute the initial stage in the development of the senile plaque. Although this study does not fully prove that the accumulated A beta P is synthesized in the neuron or neuronal process it surrounds, the images herein presented suggest that neurons are the initial nidus of plaque formation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The experiments were performed using collagenase-isolated acini, and the O2 consumption was determined using a Gilson Oxygraph 5/6 H with a Clark electrode. Stimulation with the alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist adrenaline (10 microM) lead to a 65% increase in parotid O2 consumption in about 10 sec. Addition of adrenaline after preincubation with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin showed that about 2/3 of the adrenaline-induced O2 consumption originated in alpha-adrenergic activity, whereas the remaining 1/3 stemmed from beta-adrenergic activity. Correspondingly, it was found that stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (10 microM) increased the O2 consumption with approximately 22%. Stimulation with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10 microM) did however, only increase O2 consumption with 21%. This finding is probably not related to the existence of alpha-2-adrenoceptors stimulated by adrenaline and not by phenylephrine, since: (1) the adrenaline-induced response was unaffected by preincubation by pertussis toxin, (an activator of the Gi protein of the adenylate cyclase complex), and (2) the stimulating effect of clonidine (an alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist) was inhibited by preincubation with prazosin, and (3) radioligand binding studies using [3H]-yohimbine was unsuccessful in demonstrating parotid alpha-2-adrenoceptors. Accordingly, a conclusion that accounts for the findings in this paper is that only beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors are functioning in the parotid acini and that phenylephrine acts as a partiel alpha 1-agonist. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

There is no question that the element can be noxious when consumed acutely in large quantities and there is little doubt as to cause and effect Conversely the consequences of mederate chronic sodium consumption are much harder to document. The effects are insidious and are subject to modification by a variety of environmental influences such as dietary potassium. In addition most studies of chronic sodium excess have dealt with elusive subject of \"essential\" hypertension. Interpretations of data have been very difficult, and conflicting reports have occurred. Nevertheless epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies show that chronic excess sodium ingestion acting upon a substrate of genetic susceptibility, is an important etiologic factor in essential hypertension and the expression of its sequelae. Positive correlations have also have been obtained between dietary salt and the incidence of stroke and gastric cancer. Dietary potassium appears to confer some degree of protection from the toxic properties of sodium through some unknown mechanism. Available evidence indicates that a  suitable intake of salt for man might be approximately 3.5 g/day and probably less. Salt consumption in most developed countries ranges between 8 to 40 g/day, and modern methods of food processing and preparation deplete the protective potassium. The incidences of hypertension in these countries range between 15 to 40% of their populations, and it exacts a dreadful toll. Recognition of the toxic properties of sodium and knowledge of the mechanisms involved in its toxicity offer great possibilities in the area of preventive medicine It may be possible by the sorting out of hypertension-prone subjects and dietary intervention to prevent or minimize the development of hypertension in susceptible individuals. This says nothing of other aspects of sodium toxicity, of which we are largely ignorant. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The patients were divided into subgroups based on clinical features and roentgenographic findings of chest x-ray films. In 39 patients, the pleural effusions were due to various nonneoplastic disorders and in 95 patients it was caused by malignancy. In six patients, the causes of the pleural effusions remained undetermined. A final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 68 patients, by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 58 patients, and by either one or both in 100 patients. In 82 patients who had no hemoptysis, a final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 57 cases and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 11 cases only. The diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (47/58) was superior to that of pleural examination (11/58) in 58 patients presenting with hemoptysis. In 74 patients who had pleural effusions as the sole roentgenographic abnormality, the final entity was established by pleural examination in 45 and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 12. The diagnostic merit of fiberoptic bronchoscopy was significantly higher in 59 patients who had concurrent pulmonary abnormalities on their chest roentgenograms. A final diagnosis was made in 43 cases by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in comparison with 21 cases by pleural examination. For patients with unknown pleural effusions, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was more likely to yield a diagnosis than thoracocentesis with closed pleural biopsy in those who had hemoptysis or pulmonary abnormality on chest x-ray films, whereas the reverse applied when these features were absent. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After lesions in vivo and intracerebral transplantation, the mossy fibers can alter their normal distribution within CA3 and even contact CA1 pyramidal cells. The present study examined whether similar changes could be induced in the more simple, virtual two-dimensionally organized slice cultures. For this purpose slices of 7-day-old hippocampi were prepared and subjected to one of the two following manipulations: (1) transection of the mossy fiber layer in CA3 or (2) rearrangement of the geometrical relations between the dentate granule cells in their potential targets (CA3 and CA1) by coculturing dentate slices with CA3 or CA1 slices. Two to 8 weeks later the distribution of the mossy fiber system was visualized by histochemical Timm sulphide silver staining of the terminals. The distribution of the mossy fiber system observed in previous studies of ordinary hippocampal slice cultures was confirmed. In addition, mossy fibers were found to cross the cuts through the mossy fiber layer with formation of a reduced number of characteristic Timm-stained terminals in CA3 distal to the lesion. Close proximity and contiguity of the cut surfaces were important for such growth to occur. Significantly fewer mossy fiber terminals were found when separate slices of dentate and CA3 tissue were joined and grown as cocultures. Similar apposition of slices of dentate and CA1 tissue only rarely resulted in the ingrowth of mossy fibers into CA1. The Timm-stained mossy fiber terminals were then of subnormal size. The results show the potentials of the slice culture technique in supplementing lesion and transplant studies in situ. The growth of mossy fibers across a transection of their pathway is thus a new observation, difficult to demonstrate in the brain. The limited growth in the cocultures of aberrant mossy fibers into Ca1 does, on the other hand, emphasize the importance of close structural contact for the formation of nerve connections, and such contact is apparently more easily obtained in the brain. When the growth of the mossy fibers and that of the cholinergic septohippocampal fibers are compared, it is evident that the cholinergic axons grow better both in vitro and in vivo after lesions and transplantation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The modulation by Ca2+ of the activation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) of Ca2+ channels present in native sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes from frog skeletal muscle was studied after channel incorporation into planar phospholipid bilayers in the presence of Ca2+ or Ba2+ as current carrier species. 2. Channel activity expressed as fractional open time (Po) was low (less than or equal to 0.15) in the presence of varying free Ca2+ concentrations bathing the myoplasmic face of the channel (cis side), and did not increase significantly between 0.01 and 30 microM-Ca2+. 3. Channel activation mediated by IP3 could be elicited from free Ca2+ levels similar to those of resting skeletal muscle (about 0.1 microM) and was found to be strongly regulated by the free Ca2+ concentration present at the myoplasmic moiety of the channel. 4. Channel activation by 10 microM-IP3 depended on the Ca2+ concentration on the cis side. Po reached a maximum between pCa 7.0 and 6.0, but decreased at higher concentrations of free Ca2+. Thus, Ca2+ exerted a modulatory influence on IP3-mediated activation in a concentration range where the channel was insensitive to Ca2+. 5. The results indicate that Ca2+ ions act as modulators of IP3 efficacy to open the channel. This could arise from an interaction of Ca2+ with the channel gating mechanism or with the agonist binding site. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

As revealed by electron microscopy, the partially desialylated thrombocytes adhere to macrophages predominantly via a small part of the membrane in a way that the discoidal cells adopt a vertical position with regard to the macrophage surface. One adherent macrophage was able to bind up to 55 sialidase-treated thrombocytes. Maximum binding was already reached after release of 13% of sialic acids. This interaction could be inhibited by free D-galactose and compounds with terminal D-galactose residues. Bound thrombocytes were released from the macrophages by treatment with lactose or EDTA. These experiments suggest that the interaction is mediated by a galactose-specific receptor on the macrophage surface and that galactose on thrombocytes is not recognized if it is masked by terminal sialic acid residues. The total sialic acid amount of the thrombocytes studied was about 70 micrograms sialic acid/10(10) cells being composed of 78% N-glycoloylneuraminic acid, 17% N-acetylneuraminic acid and 5% of the novel sialic acid N-(O-acetyl)glycoloylneuraminic acid, which was identified by mass spectrometry.

Previously-infected mice are markedly resistant to a second infection. Hypothymic, nu/nu ('nude') mice continue to harbor worms long after intact mice have rejected the worm burden and an inoculum of T cells at the time of, or several days after L3 injection, leads to worm elimination within 14 days in nu/nu mice. As yet no evidence is available to indicate whether or not T cells with specificity for parasite antigens are required in a reconstitutive inoculum in nu/nu mice. Pretreatment of normal mice with cyclophosphamide, at doses reported to lead to temporary B cell hypofunction, does not result in delayed rejection of worms but the participation of B cell products (antibodies) cannot be discounted on the basis of this result. The nu/nu mouse - N. brasiliensis system will be useful in the search for, and characterization of, parasite antigens which gain access to the lymphoid organs and circulation of parasitized mice and in the analysis of T cell subtypes (both functional and surface Thy and Ly alloantigenic subtypes) involved in worm elimination. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

A cell suspension obtained from bovine adrenal medulla was implanted unilaterally into the striatum. The striatal dopaminergic input was extensively destroyed beforehand to preclude the possibility of reinnervation of the striatum by endogenous dopaminergic neurons. The functional influence of the implant was tested through the measurement of drug-induced rotation, while catecholamine release was measured subsequently in the same animals by in vivo electrochemistry. Transplant survival, as shown by the immunohistochemical analysis performed at the end of the in vivo experiments, was highly variable. Surviving chromaffin cells maintained their endocrine morphology and no reinnervation of the host striatum could be detected. Rotation of the animals evoked by apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg, sc) or amphetamine (5.0 mg/kg, ip) following the lesion was left uninfluenced following transplantation, even when a large transplant was recovered. On the other hand, nicotine (0.5 mg/kg, sc) evoked a strong contraversive rotational response in the transplant-bearing animals. This response could not be ascribed to the central effect of substances released peripherally and entering the nervous system through the blood-brain barrier opened by the implantation procedure, as it could not be found in animals bearing implants of other peripheral endocrine tissue, viz, pituitary. The effect of nicotine was not blocked by the pretreatment of the animals with either the opiate antagonist naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, 10 min) or the dopamine receptor blocker pimozide (0.5 mg/kg, 1 h), although the latter pretreatment blocked the amphetamine-evoked rotation. No spontaneous catecholamine release could be detected from the implanted chromaffin cells by in vivo electrochemistry, while treatment with amphetamine or nicotine did evoke a release. The results suggest that the functional effects of such intrastriatal grafts of chromaffin cells, reported in previous studies, cannot be explained by the secretion from the grafted cells of catecholamines into the denervated striatum. On the other hand the results obtained following the pharmacological stimulation of these cells indicate that adrenal grafts can, under suitable conditions, influence the functioning of the host nervous system. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The islets of starved controls possessed larger B-cell mitochondria than those of fed ones. The earliest B-cell changes in the alloxan-treated animals were localized to the mitochondria which showed swelling, and disruption of inner and occasionally outer membranes. Later, many mitochondria were disintegrated, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex disorganized. The secretory granules were preserved, although sometimes with atypical configuration, in degenerating but non-necrotic B-cells, suggesting that insulin stored in granules is not released until the cells are necrotic. Finally, frank necrosis was seen in some B-cells, whereas others were unaffected. The Ca2+-precipitation studied by pyroantimonate technique and x-ray analysis differed in the B-cells of the alloxan-treated animals from that in the controls; the former animals exhibited no or only sparse precipitation in mitochondria and secretory granules, but a rich precipitation in the cytoplasmic ground substance, whereas the precipitation in the controls mainly was localized to mitochondria and secretory granules. The primary site of alloxan action in the B-cells is believed to be localized to the mitochondria. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

However, an increasing body of information now suggests that ET-1 is a multifunctional peptidergic regulator the actions of which are not limited to the vascular system. Although ET-1 has been shown to inhibit the gonadotropin-supported accumulation of progesterone by cultured granulosa cells, the precise cellular mechanism(s) involved remain unknown. It was therefore the objective of this study to examine in greater detail the effects of ET-1 on progestin economy in cultured granulosa cells from immature rats. Treatment with ET-1 was inhibitory to the FSH-supported accumulation of progesterone in a dose-dependent manner, an action characterized by a median inhibitory dose of 2 x 10(-11) M and a maximal inhibitory effect of 90%. This inhibitory action of ET-1 was reversible following extensive washing and could not be accounted for by a decrease in the viable cell mass. Evaluation of the activities of progesterone-forming enzymes revealed ET-1 to be a potent (P < 0.01) inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD)/isomerase (76.1 +/- 1.2% and 47.3 +/- 8.6% inhibition, respectively). Cellular radiolabeling with [3H]pregnenolone confirmed an ET-1-induced inhibition of the FSH-supported accumulation of radiolabeled progesterone. However, this effect was concomitant with enhancement of the accumulation of more distal metabolites, i.e. 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha, 20 alpha-diol, and 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one. Analysis of the FSH-supported activities of the progesterone-degrading enzymes revealed ET-1 as a potent (P < 0.05) stimulator of 20 alpha-HSD and 5 alpha-reductase (3.6 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.3-fold, stimulation respectively). In contrast, no significant changes were observed in 3 alpha-HSD activity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the ET-1 induced inhibition of gonadotropin-supported progesterone accumulation constitutes a complex phenomenon wherein ET-1 inhibits the activities of steroidogenic enzymes concerned with progesterone formation while enhancing the activities of enzymes concerned with progesterone degradation. We speculate that ET-1, possibly of intraovarian origin, acts as a luteinization-inhibitor to suppress premature luteinization at a time when continued preovulatory expression of ET-1 (in the intact but not ruptured follicle) may be contingent upon relative intrafollicular hypoxia. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These lesions are thought to be mediated by immune phenomena rather than by continuing parasitic invasion of the heart. In the present report, we correlated clinical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings in 30 endomyocardial biopsies from patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. In 12 of these biopsies, immunocytochemical techniques were used to identify and count leukocytes (common leukocyte antigen, CLA), T lymphocytes (UCHL-1 antibody) and B lymphocytes (L-26 antibody). The biopsy specimens showed variable degrees of myocardial hypertrophy and mononuclear infiltrates. No tissue forms of trypanosomes were found. The endocardium averaged 24 +/- 12.6 microns (mean +/- SD) in thickness. The mean myocyte diameter was 20 +/- 7.33 microns. The hearts were severely fibrotic containing a mean of 24.1 +/- 12.8% of fibrous tissue (range 8.2-49%), mast cells were scarce. Mononuclear cell infiltrates were found in 25 of the 30 biopsies. In 12 biopsies, immunohistochemical studies showed that the majority of the lymphocytes were T lymphocytes and associated with necrotic or degenerating myocytes. 10 of the 12 biopsy samples showed 5 or more CLA-positive mononuclear cells/high power field. In these 10 patients, T and B lymphocytes represented 32 and 13% of the total mononuclear infiltrating cells, respectively. The remaining cells were monocytes and macrophages. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To investigate the potential of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing the urge to drink and consequent gain in weight, a double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of enalapril was conducted in 25 patients receiving dialysis who had fluid overload. The trial comprised a baseline period of four weeks; two periods of treatment, each of four weeks, during which patients received either placebo or enalapril 5 mg twice each week; and a follow up period of four weeks. Five patients withdrew from the trial, one because of an adverse drug reaction to enalapril. A range of biochemical and behavioural variables was measured during the baseline period, at the completion of periods 1 and 2, and during follow up. These variables included gain in weight between dialysis sessions; blood pressure; plasma concentrations of sodium, angiotensin II, and vasopressin; plasma renin and angiotensin converting enzyme activities; osmolality; and estimations of thirst, intake of fluid, and control of drinking. Enalapril caused a significant reduction in gain in weight between dialysis sessions, thirst, and oral intake of fluid in parallel with significantly increased renin activity, significantly decreased angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and decreased concentrations of angiotensin II. Gain in weight and angiotensin converting enzyme activity returned to baseline values once patients stopped taking enalapril. These results suggest that enalapril may act on the renin-angiotensin system and reduce intake of fluid by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two out of 4 small-cell lung carcinomas were somatostatin receptor-positive, with a high density of homogeneously distributed receptors on tumour tissue only. Somatostatin receptors were characterized in one of the tumours in homogenate binding assay as saturable, high-affinity binding sites (KD = 0.53 nM) with a number of sites (Bmax) equivalent to 189 fmoles/mg protein. These sites were specific for somatostatin, since only biologically active somatostatin analogues but not unrelated peptides showed high-affinity binding. Both receptor-positive patients had limited disease; furthermore, the small-cell lung carcinoma patient with the longest survival was receptor-positive, while the one with the shortest survival was receptor-negative. None of the 12 non-small-cell lung carcinomas (5 squamous carcinomas, 7 adenocarcinomas) contained somatostatin receptors. For comparison, epidermal growth factor receptors were found in all non-small-cell lung carcinomas. Neuroendocrine features (synaptophysin, chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, protein gene product 9.5) were present in all small-cell lung carcinomas but absent in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. Given the receptor-mediated action of somatostatin in other neuroendocrine tumours, these data may have a bearing on the clinical application of somatostatin analogues in patients with small-cell lung carcinomas. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The studies on the renal effects of the drugs used in premedication were carried out on 27 patients. The renal effects of general anaesthesia and operation on renal functions were studied in 20 patients divided into 2 groups. Group I comprised of patients under diethyl ether anaesthesia while in group II halothane was used. In both groups subgroups A and B were isolated depending on the type of respiration applied during general anaesthesia (subgroup A -- manually assisted respiration, subgroup B -- spontaneous respiration). In all patients in groups I and II Octapressin was used for infiltration of the field of operation. Its renal effects were assessed on the results of determinations in 5 cases (subgroup II-A) anaesthetized with halothane and receiving manually assisted respiration. These results were compared with those in group III which comprised of 5 patients anaesthetized with halothane who were not given Octapressin infiltrations. The following conclusions have been drawn from these results: 1) Atropine and pethidine administered intravenously in therapeutic doses significantly reduce glomerular filtration. 2) Changes in renal functions observed during general anaesthesia and operation were the result of ADH secretion stimulation and changes in renal haemodynamics. 3) No differences were observed between the renal effects of diethyl ether and halothane which was due, probably, to compensatory renal mechanisms regulating renal circulation and osmotic equilibrium in the organism. 4) No differences were observed also in the renal effects of various method of ventilation used during anaesthesia. 5) Octapressin used in therapeutic doses for infiltration of the operation field had no potentiating effect on the antidiuretic action of general anaesthetic agents. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Incubation of normal human donor lymphocytes with 0.2-1 mL of AF from normal pregnant women for one hour at 37 degrees C was sufficient for induction of significant inhibition of the ability of these cells to induce a local xenogeneic graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) as well as inhibition of E and E-active rosette formation, the GVHR being the most sensitive test. On the other hand, amniotic fluid obtained from the six pregnant women in which trisomia of chromosome 21 was found showed no inhibitory activity in either the E or E-active rosette formation, nor in the local xenogeneic graft-versus-host reaction. AF from all the women tested was found to have no effect on phenotype expression of the lymphocytes, as tested by the monoclonal antibodies OKT4+ and OKT8+, nor on B-lymphocytes, as tested by surface immunoglobulins. No correlation was found between the alpha-fetoprotein levels in the sera of those women and the immunosuppressive activity.

Furthermore we predicted that maximal respiratory pressures are limited by the strength of the weaker muscle involved. To test these hypotheses, we measured the pleural pressure, abdominal pressure (Pab), and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during maximal inspiratory, open-glottis and closed-glottis expulsive, and combined inspiratory and expulsive maneuvers in four adults. We then determined the activation of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles during selected maximal respiratory maneuvers, using electromyography and phrenic nerve stimulation. In all subjects, the Pdi generated during maximal inspiratory efforts was significantly lower than the Pdi generated during open-glottis expulsive or combined efforts, suggesting that rib cage, not diaphragm, strength limits maximal inspiratory pressure. Similarly, at high lung volumes, the Pab generated during closed-glottis expulsive efforts was significantly greater than that generated during open-glottis efforts, suggesting that the latter pressure is limited by diaphragm, not abdominal muscle, strength. As predicted, diaphragm activation was submaximal during maximal inspiratory efforts, and abdominal muscle activation was submaximal during open-glottis expulsive efforts at midlung volume. Additionally, assisting the inspiratory muscles of the rib cage with negative body-surface pressure significantly increased maximal inspiratory pressure, whereas loading the rib cage muscles with rib cage compression decreased maximal inspiratory pressure. We conclude that activation of the chest wall muscles during static respiratory efforts is determined by the relative strengths and mechanical advantage of the muscles involved. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although both studies demonstrated comparable spatial distribution patterns, PIXE had the advantage that Pt concentrations could be determined quantitatively, in contrast to the relative information obtained by the autoradiographic technique. Using PIXE, the distribution of Pt in i.p. tumors was studied after i.p. administration of CDDP. The highest Pt concentrations were always found on the periphery of tumors, indicating that the periphery was exposed to a higher drug concentration than the center. Dose was correlated to the concentration of CDDP at both the center and the periphery (r = 0.99). The Pt concentration in the periphery was usually higher by a factor of 2-3 after i.p. administration than after i.v. treatment, whereas in the center of the tumor no concentration difference could be detected. The penetration depth of CDDP lay between 1 and 2 mm and was calculated from the differences in Pt concentration after i.p. and i.v. treatment. This indicates that the effective advantage of i.p. chemotherapy with CDDP in cases of cancers limited to the peritoneal cavity is accentuated at the periphery of the tumor. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

One of these chemically synthesized domains, peptide Hep-I, has the sequence TAGSCLRKFSTM and originates from the a1(noncollagenous [NC1]) chain of type IV collagen (Koliakos, G. G., K. K. Koliakos, L. T. Furcht, L. A. Reger, and E. C. Tsilibary. 1989. J. Biol. Chem. 264:2313-2323). We describe in this report that this same peptide also bound to intact type IV collagen in solid-phase assays, in a dose-dependent and specific manner. Interactions between peptide Hep-I and type IV collagen in solution resulted in inhibition of the assembly process of this basement membrane glycoprotein. Therefore, peptide Hep-I should represent a major recognition site in type IV collagen when this protein polymerizes to form a network. In addition, solid phase-immobilized peptide Hep-I was able to promote the adhesion and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial cells. When present in solution, peptide Hep-I competed for the binding of these cells to type IV collagen- and NC1 domain-coated substrata in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, radiolabeled peptide Hep-I in solution also bound to endothelial cells in a dose-dependent and specific manner. The binding of radiolabeled Hep-I to endothelial cells could be inhibited by an excess of unlabeled peptide. Finally, in the presence of heparin or chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains, the binding of endothelial cells to peptide Hep-I and NC1 domain-coated substrates was also inhibited. We conclude that peptide Hep-I should have a number of functions. The role of this type IV collagen-derived sequence in such diverse phenomena as self-association, heparin binding and cell binding and adhesion makes Hep-I a crucial domain involved in the determination of basement membrane ultrastructure and cellular interactions with type IV collagen-containing matrices. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

One of the implications of this hypothesis is that specific macrophage-arming factor (SMAF) is produced early during the initiation of the immune response, whereas the \"classical\" cell-mediated immune response components, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), are produced later, that is, during the amplifier-effector phase. In this paper we establish the kinetics of the induction of (a) lymphocytes producing SMAF and (b) CTL. Groups of DBA/2 mice were injected i.p. once, twice or three times with irradiated and/or non-irradiated syngeneic SL2 tumor cells, the injections being given at intervals of 10 days. After each of these injections the production of SMAF and the expression of CTL activity were established. The results showed that in the peritoneal cavity SMAF-producing lymphocytes appeared earlier than cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). In addition, it was shown (a) that SMAF does not interfere with the in vitro cytotoxicity expressed by CTL and (b) that in addition to CTL memory cells, SMAF-producing memory cells were also induced after injection of syngeneic tumor cells. These data support the hypothesis that SMAF is involved in the early phase of the cellular immune response against tumors, whereas CTL are induced later. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Physical symptoms during the procedure were also monitored. The CaF was found to correlate best with the Q-oTc interval as compared to the Q-oT, Q-Tc, or Q-T interval. While the correlation was significant (r = 0.592, p less than .001), the Q-oTc could not predict the CaF. A number of other blood constituents were found to change during plateletpheresis, with most directly related to either citrate administration or hemodilution. Severe physical symptoms were found in one subject and no symptoms in three. In the subjects without symptoms the changes in Q-oTc, Pi, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose through the plateletpheresis procedure were different from changes in all subjects. The decrease in glucose level was the most striking single factor correlating with the lack of physical symptoms during the citrate-induced hypocalcemia associated with plateletpheresis. It is concluded that monitoring of the ECG cannot substitute for direct measurement of free calcium in citrate-induced hypocalcemia, that the physical symptoms associated with similar levels of hypocalcemia are variable, that glucose level may be a marker for the effects of citrate-induced hypocalcemia, and that lowered citrate loads during plateletpheresis appear warranted. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In an attempt to determine which tests best aid the surgeon in these determinations, the authors prospectively compared preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the liver and intraoperative ultrasound (IOU) in 42 patients with liver tumors who underwent 45 exploratory operations. The primary diseases included colorectal cancer metastases in 27 patients, hepatoma in 11 patients, and metastatic cancers of other origins in 4 patients. In the 42 patients there were 89 identified hepatic lesions that were confirmed to be malignant by resection, biopsy, or continued growth on follow-up CT. The sensitivity of either test for detecting these lesions was 69/89 (77%) for CT and 87/89 (98%) for IOU. Resection was not feasible in 13 patients. Five had extrahepatic disease, 4 had more nodules discovered by IOU, 3 were found by IOU to have involvement of all three hepatic veins by tumor and 1 patient had portal-vein invasion. Alternatively, in four patients tumors thought to involve all three hepatic veins by CT were shown to be free of at least one hepatic vein, thereby permitting resection. In one patient who had been previously operated upon, a tumor thought to involve the remaining right hepatic vein was seen to be free of the vein, also permitting resection. Regarding the extent of resection, IOU was also helpful. Lesser procedures than anticipated were proved possible by IOU in seven patients. A more extensive resection was shown to be necessary by IOU in two patients. Thus, IOU affected the operative management in 22 of 45 operative episodes (49%). It was conclude that IOU is superior to both preoperative CT and surgical exploration in assessing both the feasibility and the extent of resection required for primary and secondary hepatic cancers. In the authors' experience, IOU is the most sensitive indicator of number of lesions present in the liver. In addition, the ability of IOU to determine hepatic venous anatomy is a helpful adjunct in determining resectability of liver tumors. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The same picture of reactivity was observed with patients' and healthy donors' sera, and in both groups 35% of the cases were high responders on 1 line and 21% on the other one. The specificity of the reactions was analyzed by absorption experiments using 12 melanoma sera selected for their high binding activity. Pools of human erythrocytes or leukocytes did not remove, except in 1 case respectively, the activity of the sera, suggesting that it was not directed against alloantigens. Quantitative absorption experiments were done with the 2 melanoma lines and with 1 colon carcinoma line. The results, evaluated on the basis of absorption capacity per cell, indicate that the 2 melanoma lines had a similar amount of shared antigens, whereas the colon line was also effective in absorbing out the serum activity, but less frequently and less efficiently. Further experiments performed to analyze the influence of culturing the target cells in presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), showed that the activity of sera was removed, at various degrees for different sera, by absorption with free FBS, with FBS coupled to Sepharose 4B, and with normal leukocytes cultured overnight with 10% FBS. The same positive melanoma sera became negative when assayed on the same melanoma line cultured in gamma-globulin-depleted human AB serum. In conclusion, in our experimental conditions, the activity of melanoma sera seems mostly directed against components of FBS absorbed on cell membrane during culturing. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Acyclovir was administered by a 1-hr intravenous infusion at doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg. At the end of infusion, mean peak plasma levels (+/- SEM), determined by radioimmunoassay, were 6.4 +/- 0.7, 12.1 +/- 2.3, 14.9 +/- 2.7, and 33.7 +/- 7.1 microM. The plasma concentration-time profiles could be described by a biexponential equation. The half-life of acyclovir in the slow disposition phase ranged from 2.2 to 5 hr and the drug was detected in the plasma for at least 18 hr after infusion. The total body clearance ranged from 117 to 396 ml/min/1.73 m2. A proportionality between area under the curve and dose suggests that acyclovir exhibits dose-independent kinetics in the dose range studied. There was wide variation in cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged drug, ranging from 30 to 69% of the dose. From renal clearances of acyclovir, which were higher than creatinine clearances, it appears that both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion contribute to its renal excretion. Analysis of the urine by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of the metabolite 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine. There was no indication of toxicity either clinically or from laboratory findings in any of the study subjects. This study demonstrates that in addition to selectivity and low toxicity, the kinetic profile and metabolic disposition of acyclovir make it an attractive candidate for therapy in a variety of herpes infections. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Single-site alterations were introduced into the appropriate segment of the E. coli 16 S rRNA gene by mutagenesis in vitro. Their effects on S8-rRNA interaction were measured via a filter-binding assay, utilizing S8 binding sites transcribed in vitro from the altered 16 S rRNA gene fragments. Of the 12 rRNA mutants, six were unable to bind S8. Significantly, five of these occur within a small, phylogenetically conserved internal loop, defined by nucleotides 596-597 and 641-643, suggesting that this structure plays a major role in S8-16 S rRNA recognition. The reduced affinity of S8 for its binding site in these cases was closely correlated with growth defects that resulted from expression of the same mutations in vivo. Alterations at other positions in the S8 binding site had little influence on complex formation or cell growth, as long as they did not disrupt rRNA secondary structure. The specific interaction of S8 with a segment of the spc operon mRNA containing a putative site of translational feedback regulation was demonstrated using appropriate in vitro transcripts in conjunction with the filter-binding assay. The apparent association constant for the S8-mRNA interaction was determined to be approximately 5 x 10(6) M-1, about five times lower than for the interaction of S8 with wild-type 16 S rRNA. The structure of the regulatory binding site, determined by sequence analysis of spc operon mRNA protected by S8 from RNase digestion, was found to contain all of the characteristic features of the 16 S rRNA binding site, demonstrating that the protein associates with structurally similar domains in both RNAs. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Heteropneustes fossilis subjected to pinealectomy, eye enucleation, or both were exposed to short (LD 9:15) or long (LD 14:10) photoperiod during the different stages of the annual reproductive cycle. During the preparatory period, pinealectomy accelerated ovarian recrudescence under long photoperiod, but no effects of pinealectomy were observed under short photoperiod. Pineal has no influence on ovarian activity during the prespawning and spawning periods of the reproductive cycle. In the late postspawning period, ovarian recrudescence is accelerated after pinealectomy in catfish maintained under short photoperiod (LD 9:15 at 25 degrees C). But under long photoperiod (LD 14:10 at 25 degrees C), pinealectomy delayed ovarian recrudescence. An investigation into the role of the eyes revealed that eye enucleation nullifies the inhibitory effects of LD 9:15 and represses the stimulatory effects of LD 14:10. Combined surgery inhibited ovarian development under both the regimes. It is significant that pinealectomy and/or blinding neither counteracted nor delayed the postspawning ovarian regression. The findings suggest that the role of the pineal in catfish reproduction is variable and depends upon the photoperiod to which they are exposed as well as on the time of the year and the stage of the reproductive cycle. It is concluded that extraretinal and extrapineal photoreceptors also are involved in influencing seasonal reproduction. Further, no effects of melatonin treatment on ovarian activity or on vitellogenin levels during the preparatory or prespawning periods were observed, indicating that the pineal effects on gonadal activity in catfish may not be mediated through the secretion of melatonin. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In this study a structural analog of hemicholinium-3, a,a'-bis[di(2-chloroethyl)amino]-4,4'-2-biacetophenone (toxin 7), was added to synaptosomes prepared from the cortex, striatum or hippocampus of rat brain. Synaptosomal high affinity choline uptake (HACU) was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner by addition of toxin 7, while synaptosomal uptake of GABA or dopamine was not changed. Incubation of cortical synaptosomes with the monosialoganglioside GM1 prevented the decrease in HACU seen following administration of toxin 7. This preventative effect of GM1 was greater if GM1 was added prior to or concomitant with toxin 7, than if GM1 was added following toxin 7. Two newly synthesized hemicholinium-3 analogs, 4-[3'-di(2-chloroethyl)aminopropionyl]biphenyl (toxin 5) and 4-[3'-di(2-bromoethyl)aminopropionyl]biphenyl (toxin 6) caused a large decrease in HACU when added to cortical synaptosomes, this decrease was significantly greater than that seen with the same dose of toxin 7 or ethyl-choline aziridinium (AF64A). Ultrastructural changes in the synaptosomal membrane following incubation with toxin 7 or toxin 7 with GM1 were examined by electron microscopy. Development of a compound which is both a potent neurotoxin, and is specific for cholinergic neurons will allow new insights into the normal function of the cholinergic system in the CNS and provide animal models of disease states in which cholinergic degeneration is an important element. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Between November 1, 1981, and October 31, 1986, 184 patients presented for the first time to a general practitioner or hospital with a TIA. The crude annual incidence rate was 0.35/1000, 0.42/1000 standardized to the 1981 population of England and Wales. We estimate that each year approximately 21,000 patients in England and Wales (about half of whom are greater than 70 years old) consult a doctor for the first time with a TIA. Approximately 80% of our 184 patients had TIAs in the carotid distribution; the remainder had TIAs in the vertebrobasilar distribution or TIAs of uncertain vascular distribution. The incidence of TIA increased sharply with increasing age, and the overall incidence in men was very similar to that in women (incidence ratio 1.3). However, in middle age, men were much more likely to suffer a TIA than women (odds ratio 2.6), which probably explains the marked male predominance in most hospital-based studies and treatment trials in which the elderly, and thus women, are underrepresented. This has important implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials of treatment for TIAs. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Infective larvae (L3) levels on pasture were high (2422 +/- 365 L3/kg D.M. grass in midsummer 1988) when host population density was high, decreasing after the sheep population declined by 70% in early 1989 (601 +/- 14 L3/kg D.M. in midsummer 1989). The availability of infective larvae to sheep increased during the winter of 1988-1989, probably as a result of concentration of existing larvae on grass as vegetation was destroyed by bad weather and overgrazing. Increased availability of pre-parasitic stages was accompanied by a marked increased in faecal egg counts from sheep of all ages and both sexes. Prevalence and intensity of infection (faecal egg counts) were higher in males than females throughout the 2-year study (chi 2 = 208.3, P < 0.005 and F1, 2000 = 304, P < 0.001 respectively), except during the lambing periods, and decreased with age in both sexes. Changes in prevalence and intensity of strongyle infections were associated with changes in host population density. Prevalence and intensity of Dictyocaulus filaria larvae in faeces increased during the host population crash. Infection intensity decreased with age (F1, 203 = 44.02, P < 0.001) and was higher in males than females (F1, 203 = 13.45, P < 0.001). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In no-choice tests, L. trifolii fed more, produced more offspring, and had the highest pupal and adult productivity on the widely planted cultivar 'Tall Utah' 52-70R (Apium graveolens L.). Antibiotic effects of the commercial cultivar 'Tall Utah' 52-70 HK and University of California families 87A-147 and 87A-338, derived from A. chilense Hook and Arn., were intermediate. Only A. nodiflorum (L.) Lag (accession 87A-236) did not allow survival beyond the larval stage. Concentrations of the carcinogenic and mutagenic linear furanocoumarins varied by location within plants (leaves usually greater than petioles), by specific compound (trend: psoralen less than xanthotoxin less than bergapten or isopimpinellin), and between accessions. A. nodiflorum had the lowest foliar levels of phototoxic furanocoumarins (11.8 micrograms/g fresh weight) and the best potential for use in the breeding program. Foliar levels of phototoxic furanocoumarins (psoralen, bergapten, and xanthotoxin) in plants 87A-147-3 (406 micrograms/g), 87A-147-2 (292.9 micrograms/g), and the family 87A-338 (265.9 micrograms/g) were 22.6, 16.3, and 14.8 times higher, respectively, than the concentration known to produce contact dermatitis (18 micrograms/g).

Fasted adult male rats weighing approximately 350 g were given 50 micrograms of fluoride in 1 ml of water by stomach intubation, with 14C-labeled polyethylene glycol as a marker of water movement through the gastrointestinal tract. Rats were killed at intervals up to 120 min, and the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, distal ileum and cecum were rapidly clamped and removed for fluoride analysis and 14C counting. Approximately 90% of the fluoride dose was absorbed in 120 min. Peak plasma fluoride concentration occurred 10 min after intubation and began to decline after 40 min as the rate of fluoride absorption slowed. Absorption from the stomach was derived from rates of gastric emptying and remaining fluoride. Even at 10 min after intubation, when the bulk of the fluoride remained in the stomach, only approximately 25% of fluoride absorption had occurred from the stomach and 75% from the small intestine. After 120 min, 19.8% of total fluoride absorption had occurred from the stomach. Although the stomach is unquestionably a significant site for fluoride absorption, its contribution is much smaller than that of the small intestine. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Without enalapril, sodium excretion rose from 127 +/- 19 (mean +/- SE) to 437 +/- 103 mumol/min in the first 20 minutes after ANF was administered. Clearance studies performed during maximal water diuresis indicated a rise in glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium excretion. Four days of enalapril (20 mg b.i.d.) increased effective renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance) and reduced blood pressure (from 114/71 +/- 2/2 to 105/60 +/- 2/1 mm Hg). Under these conditions baseline sodium excretion was not different from the control study, but it rose less after ANF (from 117 +/- 22 to 242 +/- 63 mumol/min), and the increments in glomerular filtration rate, free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium were all blunted and nonsignificant. In addition, effective renal plasma flow tended to fall; this effect was not observed when ANF was given without enalapril. These results support the notion that the effects of ANF on renal hemodynamics and on tubular sodium handling depend on renal angiotensin II and that blood pressure reduction may interfere with the ANF-induced natriuresis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The concentration-response profiles for retinoic acid (RA), triamcinolone (TRI), hydrocortisone (HC), dexamethasone (DEX), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were examined and the mechanisms of clefting in vitro were compared to observed in vivo responses. Craniofacial regions were dissected on gestational day (GD) 12 for mice and GD 14 for rat, and cultured for 3-4 days in Bigger's BGJb medium in flasks flushed with 50% O2, 45% N2, 5% CO2. Growth and fusion of secondary palates were scored under a dissecting microscope. In serum-free control medium, mouse and rat palatal fusion occurred within the 4-day culture period. Supplementing with fetal bovine serum (FBS) in excess of 1% interfered with growth and fusion in control medium. RA significantly inhibited fusion of mouse and rat palates at 5 x 10(-9) and 1 x 10(-10) M, respectively, with RA-induced clefting related to abnormal proliferation and differentiation of medial epithelia. In contrast, glucocorticoid-induced clefting was due to concentration-dependent inhibition of shelf growth. TRI significantly inhibited fusion at 4 x 10(-5) M, and 1 x 10(-4) M DEX or HC, inhibited fusion of 19 and 42% of shelves, respectively. The response rate for DEX in the presence of 1% FBS was increased (42% unfused). TCDD clefting was due to altered medial epithelial differentiation and 1 x 10(-8) M TCDD affected 36% of CD-1 mouse, 23% of C57BL/6N mouse, and 47% of F344 rat palates. When the medium was supplemented with 1% FBS, selenium, transferrin, and additional glutamine, the response of C57BL/6N embryos increased to 75%. This rate is similar to that reported for Trowell's-type cultures with IMEM:F12 medium and 1% FBS. The increased responsiveness to DEX or TCDD in the presence of serum suggests that an unknown factor in serum may be required for full activity. Three human embryonic palatal explants (GD 52 or 53) were cultured for 3-6 days and fused during culture. The present study demonstrates that serum-free organ culture supports development of mouse, rat, and human palatal explants. The present study demonstrates the capacity of this organ culture system to model palatogenesis for several species, and to distinguish between various mechanisms of clefting as presented through selected model compounds. This model should be useful for exploring mechanisms of activity at a cellular and molecular level. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

At peak urine flow, which was similar in hypothyroid DI (HDI) and control DI (CDI) rats, inulin clearance (CIn/kg) and CH2O/kg were 23 and 20% (P less than 0.02) lower in HDI. Fractional urine flow and fractional sodium excretion were 30 and 40% (P less than 0.001) higher in HDI. Utilization of distal delivery of filtrate for CH2O, formation was 16% less in HDI (P less than 0.01). Papillary osmolality was not higher in HDI rats. Data in Sprague-Dawley rats were similar to those of the DI rats, indicating that endogenous ADH was effectively suppressed. It is concluded: 1) delivery of filtrate out of the proximal tubule was not diminished in hypothyroid rats in spite of a decrease in CIn; 2) despite a similar delivery of filtrate to the distal diluting site, CH2O formation was less in hypothyroid rats than in controls; 3) these data suggest that a defect in the diluting segment could be unmasked at high rates of filtrate delivered to the distal nephron; 4) this defect could be either due to impaired sodium chloride reabsorption or due to increased backdiffusion of water in the distal nephron. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Since lateralized dopamine function is associated with circling behavior we sought to determine whether dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors were asymmetrically distributed in the striata of adolescent and adult ckr mice using receptor autoradiography. Stereotypic and rotational responses to quinpirole served as behavioral indices of D2 receptor function. The ckr mice showed hemispherically asymmetric elevations in DA D2 receptors in the lateral subregions of the striatum whereas medial regions of the striatum were symmetrically and bilaterally elevated (overall elevation = 30%). As a group, ckr mice had higher D2 receptor levels on the side which was contralateral to the preferred direction of spontaneous nocturnal rotation. Striatal D1 receptors and mesolimbic D2 and D1 receptors of ckr mice were neither elevated nor differentially asymmetric. Young adult ckr mice showed dose-dependent increases in net rotations in response to quinpirole whereas normal mice showed no change from baseline levels. Both groups showed similar stereotypic responses. Older adult ckr mice, however, showed dose-dependent reductions in rotation after quinpirole whereas normal mice turned at baseline levels. Older ckr mice also displayed significantly greater stereotyped sniffing behavior. This unique mutant provides a novel genetic model of basal ganglia dysfunction, and may be useful in studying aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with dopaminergic abnormalities. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Agents Chemother. 12:368-372, 1977). The model assumes (i) that diffusion of the antibiotic molecules across the outer membrane obeys Fick's law and can be characterized by a permeability constant for any given combination of organism and drug, (ii) that drug hydrolysis within the periplasm obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and (iii) that a steady state is rapidly attained between drug uptake and hydrolysis. The model has allowed accurate prediction of antibiotic MICs for Escherichia coli strains from a knowledge of their beta-lactamase production and permeability characteristics. It has been suggested that the model is inappropriate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but attempts to confirm this have been bedevilled by experimental difficulties in estimating permeability coefficients for this species. In the present study, we tested a prediction of the model that the overall resistance of P. aeruginosa transconjugants containing a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase should continue to depend partly on permeability. Transconjugants with PSE-4 beta-lactamase were constructed in host strains with widely different levels of intrinsic, presumably impermeability-determined resistance. Contrary to the prediction of the model, all the transconjugants developed identical overall levels of resistance to substrate beta-lactams, such as azlocillin and cefoperazone, irrespective of the initial levels of intrinsic resistance of the recipient strains. We conclude that the model is inappropriate for P. aeruginosa, and possible explanations for the organism's behavior are discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Oxygen saturation was reduced to 65-74% for 2 wk. Eight lambs served as normoxemic controls. beta-receptor density (Bmax) and ligand affinity (KD) were determined with the radio-ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol and adenylate cyclase activity determined during stimulation with isoproterenol, sodium fluoride (NaF), and forskolin. During chronic hypoxemia, Bmax decreased 45% (hypoxemic, 180.6 +/- 31.5 vs. control, 330.5 +/- 60.1 fmol/mg) in the left ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia alone) but was unchanged in the right ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia and pressure overload).

Left ventricular isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased by 39% (30.0 +/- 4.3% increase vs. 44.1 +/- 9.5% increase) whereas right ventricular adenylate cyclase activity was unchanged. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase with NaF or forskolin was not different from control in either ventricle.

Contractile responses to the nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol, the beta 2-selective agonist zinterol, and the direct- and indirect-acting agonists dopamine and dopexamine were compared in isolated right ventricular trabeculae removed from failing, nonfailing innervated, and previously transplanted and, therefore, denervated nonfailing human hearts. In failing hearts, the contractile response to isoproterenol was significantly lower (41%) than that in nonfailing innervated hearts. The responses to the mixed agonists dopamine and dopexamine were even more attenuated in failing hearts, to a level 76-90% lower than those of nonfailing innervated hearts. In denervated, previously transplanted, nonfailing hearts, the contractile responses to the mixed agonists dopamine and dopexamine were 66-72% lower than those in the nonfailing innervated group, but the response to isoproterenol was not significantly different. The response to zinterol was not significantly different among the three groups. In subjects with severe heart failure, in vivo hemodynamic responses to dopexamine were compared with those of the direct-acting beta-agonist dobutamine. Responses to dopexamine and dobutamine were measured before and after prolonged continuous infusions of each drug. The response to dopexamine, but not to dobutamine, diminished over time. We conclude that a large component of the inotropic response to dopamine and dopexamine in human hearts is due to the ability of these agonists to promote the release of neuronal norepinephrine; when neuronal norepinephrine is depleted, indirect-acting agonists are less able to produce an inotropic response. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By electron microscopy, the S-type asymmetric junctions (believed to mediate excitation) as well as F-type symmetric junctions (thought to provide inhibition) were identified within the RVLM area examined. The axonal terminals thick with spherical electron-transparent synaptic vesicles, measuring about 50 nm in diameter and forming S-type synapses, were distributed within the entire area. Large numbers of axonal terminals forming the F-type synapses and filled with flattened synaptic vesicles with a longitudinal axis of around 60-80 nm were found at the site located 5-6 mm caudal to the trapezoid bodies. Both spherical electron-transparent and flattened synaptic vesicles could be found together with electron-dense vesicles averaging 80-160 nm in diameter. No axonal terminals containing only the latter type of vesicles were found within the area studied. Some axo-axo-dendritic F-S-type synapses were identified within the RVLM. Unilateral injection of GABA into the RVLM site located 2-5 mm caudal to the trapezoid bodies induced a dose-related fall in the systemic arterial pressure and inhibition of the renal nerve sympathetic activity, the most marked responses being found at the site 4-5 mm caudal to the trapezoid bodies. It also resulted in decrease of heart rate and myocardial contractility when injected into a distinct site, located 0-1.5 mm rostral to the outflow of the 12th cranial nerve roots. There was some laterality in GABA effects on heart rate and myocardial contractility following its injections into the RVLM on the left and right side. Injections of bicuculline into the GABA-sensitive RVLM site resulted in an increase in cardio-haemodynamic responses together with the enhancement of renal nerve sympathetic activity in a dose-related fashion. These results suggest that, in cats, GABA-sensitive sympathoexcitatory neuronal structures in the RVLM alter peripheral sympathetic vasomotor and cardiac nerve background activities through GABA action on the bicuculline-sensitive GABAa-receptors. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

No dog received antigen, agonist, or therapeutic aerosols for 4 weeks before BAL. The fluid recovered was centrifuged, and the number of mast cells was quantitated. Aliquots containing equal numbers of mast cells were incubated with A 23187 or C5 for 30 minutes, and histamine release was measured by an automated fluorometric method. Spontaneous release, A 23187-induced release, C5-induced release, and total histamine content per mast cell were calculated. The total amount of histamine per mast cell was not significantly different in BGs and allergic and nonallergic control dogs. Mast cells obtained by BAL released histamine to A 23187 and C5 in a dose-related manner. Spontaneous histamine release and A 23187-induced histamine release was significantly greater in BGs and allergic control dogs compared to nonallergic control dogs. C5-induced histamine release was significantly greater in BGs than in allergic as well as nonallergic control dogs. These data suggest that BAL mast cell histamine releasability must be defined with respect to each stimulus and that mast cells obtained from BAL from control dogs differ with respect to histamine releasability from mast cells of allergic dogs with and without airway hyperresponsiveness.

Sixty-two of the women had experienced a spontaneous delivery that did not require forceps assistance. In 58 patients, an episiotomy was performed. Of the 35 women in whom an episiotomy was not performed, 24 women required sutures and only four women did not suffer any perineal damage. The median time for perineal comfort in general (including walking and sitting) was one month (range, zero to six months); 20% of women took more than two months to achieve general perineal comfort. For comfort during sexual intercourse, the median time was three months (range, one to more than 12 months); 20% of women took longer than six months to achieve comfort during sexual intercourse. Factors that were associated with discomfort for longer than the median time were delivery by forceps; spontaneous vaginal (not perineal) tears; and, in the three to four days after the birth, oedema and the breakdown of muscle or skin sutures. There was no significant difference in these times between patients who did not undergo an episiotomy and those who underwent an episiotomy without a forceps delivery. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

At normal temperature the potential evoked by stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract consists of an initial spike (IS), a negative (N), and a positive (P) potentials. The IS potential has been considered to be presynaptic in origin and the latter two postsynaptic. During cooling from 37 to 15 degrees C, the amplitude of both the IS and the N potentials increased to attain the maximum value (10-36% increase) at about 32 degrees C, then decreased gradually and disappeared at around 15 degrees C. On the other hand, the durations of the IS and the N potentials were prolonged gradually on cooling from 37 to 17 degrees C. Most of the olfactory cortical neurons responded with one or two firings to the tract stimulation. The firing numbers increased on cooling down to about 32 degrees C and declined on further cooling, which corresponds with the behavior of the N potential. All these effects were reversible on rewarming. Augmentation of the N potential might depend primarily on the increase in amplitude of the IS potential and secondarily on the increase of amount of liberated transmitter substance and/or the delayed inactivation process of the transmitter action. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Men with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio above the 90th percentile had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h glucose after a 75 g oral glucose load, and fasting serum insulin. Women with high urinary albumin:creatinine values had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and triglycerides. Multivariate analysis showed that only systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose in men, and diastolic blood pressure and fasting insulin in women, independently contributed to urinary albumin:creatinine. When the effect of blood pressure was eliminated by excluding subjects with systolic blood pressure > 140 and diastolic > 90 mm Hg, only fasting insulin was associated with urinary albumin:creatinine in women. No associations were found for men. We conclude that microalbuminuria may be a marker for cardiovascular disease only because of its association with blood pressure in men, while in women, there is an additional independent association with fasting serum insulin. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The mechanism of this enhanced lysis was investigated by analyzing interactions of IFN-gamma-treated and nontreated cultured KC with allogeneic class I-specific CTL clones. rIFN-gamma treatment augmented KC lysis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Increased lysis of IFN-KC was detected after only 2 h of IFN-gamma treatment and was maximal by 12 h. Enhanced lysis of IFN-KC was Ag-specific, inasmuch as nonantigenic IFN-KC were not lysed either directly or as bystanders during the lysis of antigenic KC. Parallel immunofluorescence and cytotoxicity assays of KC treated with IFN-gamma for various intervals revealed a direct correlation between the degree of increased KC lysis and levels of cell surface ICAM-1 (CD54), but not of specific alloantigen or beta 2-microglobulin. Lysis of nontreated KC was blocked by mAb against class I or CD3, but not by mAb against ICAM-1 or LFA-1. In contrast, lysis of IFN-KC was partially inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 or anti-LFA-1 mAb, but resisted inhibition by anti-class I mAb except in the presence of anti-ICAM-1. These results indicate that both ICAM-1/LFA-1 and Ag/CD3-TcR interactions are important for Ag-specific lysis of IFN-KC, whereas lysis of nontreated KC depends on Ag/CD3-TcR but not ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions. Equivalent inhibition of IFN-KC lysis by mAb against ICAM-1 or LFA-1 suggests that ICAM-1 is the only LFA-1 ligand involved in enhanced IFN-KC lysis. Furthermore, enhanced CTL lysis of KC after short-term IFN-gamma treatment can be explained solely on the basis of ICAM-1 induction, because all of the increase in specific lysis associated with IFN-gamma treatment could be blocked by mAb that block ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The method is based on the quantitative analysis of the products of standard multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 18 different exons of the dystrophin gene, and is designated \"QM-PCR.\" We detected deletions of one or more exons by standard multiplex PCR in DMD/BMD patients in 14 of 18 families examined (77.7%). The same deletions were readily demonstrated by QM-PCR in nine of 14 mothers (64.3%) and in another six of 22 possible carriers in these families. In five families where deletions were detectable in DMD/BMD patients, the mothers did not exhibit any deletions in their peripheral blood (35.7%). We obtained evidence for germinal mosaicism in at least two of these families and confirmed carrier identification by haplotype analysis using CA repeat polymorphisms at the 5\\' and 3\\' ends of the dystrophin gene. Furthermore, analysis of 17 coded DNA samples from normal females and obligatory carriers by QM-PCR showed that this technique could directly identify carriers of deletions in any of 18 different exons of the dystrophin gene. Its application in combination with existing techniques is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of carrier diagnosis in many families, and it may also be applicable to families in which pedigree and polymorphism information is insufficient for carrier diagnosis. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

It was found that the threshold dose of aconitine inducing arrhythmia in mice and the recovery rate to normal sinus rhythm increased significantly, ED50 of GABA was 5.4-5.8 mg.kg-1. The duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induced by aconitine in rats was shortened (P < 0.01). The incidence and the mortality of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in GABA group were decreased to 0/10 vs 6/10 and 5/10 in control, respectively (P < 0.05). The doses of ouabain to induce ectopic beats (EB), VT, VF, and cardiac arrest (CA) in guinea pigs were increased (P < 0.01). The incidence of VF induced by coronary artery ligation in rats was decreased to 0/5 in GABA group vs 4/5 in control group (P < 0.01). The total amount of EB, total time of VT, and VF were 66%, 41%, and 0% of the control group, respectively. The anti-arrhythmic effects of GABA were dose-dependent and as potent as procainamide (10 or 5 mg.kg-1, iv).

Mitotic cells were selected from a monolayer of Chinese hamster ovary cells for 80 min (nine shakes) to establish the rate of cell progression into mitosis. The cell monolayers were then exposed to 0.1295 MBq/ml 125IUdR for 10 min to label the cells in S phase. After pulse labeling, mitotic cell selection was continued for various times (between 0 and 120 min) before 125I decays were accumulated at 4 degrees C. After 2 h in the cold, the cells were rewarmed and the selection of mitotic cells was continued. (Cooling had a small, transient affect on subsequent cell progression.) As the time between labeling and cooling was increased, the fraction of cells selected in mitosis decreased, indicating that an increasing proportion of 125I-labeled cells had entered a sensitive phase of the cell cycle where 125I decays are particularly effective in producing radiation-induced division delay. It is hypothesized that during this sensitive period (from -25 to +90 min of the S/G2 boundary), the labeled DNA comes into sufficiently close contact with a non-DNA structure to facilitate damage to this structure by overlap irradiation from 125I decays in the DNA. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Specific behavioral response components are attributed to the activity of particular muscles. Compensatory optomotor turning reactions to large-field image displacements mainly occur when the stimulus pattern oscillates at low frequencies. In contrast, turning responses towards objects are preferentially induced by motion of relatively small stimuli at high oscillation frequencies. The different steering muscles seem to be functionally specialized in that they contribute to the control of these behavioral responses in different ways. The muscles I1, III1 and b2 are preferentially active during small-field motion at high oscillation frequencies. They are much less active during small-field motion at low oscillation frequencies and large-field motion at all oscillation frequencies which were tested. M.b2 is most extreme in this respect. These steering muscles thus mediate mainly turns towards objects. In contrast, M.b1 responds best during large-field motion at low oscillation frequencies and, thus, is appropriate to control compensatory optomotor responses. However, the activity of this muscle is also strongly modulated during small-field motion at high oscillation frequencies and, therefore, may be involved also in the control of turns towards objects. These functional specializations of the different steering muscles in mediating different behavioral response components are related to the properties of two parallel visual pathways that are selectively tuned to large-field and small-field motion, respectively. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In Northern blot experiments, the earliest expression of the T11.15 transcript was detected in the thymus at embryonic day 10 (i.e., 1 day after cytoplasmic expression of a CD3 epitope recognized by a specific monoclonal antibody [CT3; Chen, C.L.H., Ager, L.L., Gartland, G.L. & Cooper, M.D. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 164, 375-380], but 2 days before the appearance of clonotypic components of the T-cell antigen receptor). Sequence similarity of this chicken protein sequence compared with that of the known mammalian CD3 gamma and delta polypeptides was 36-39% and 39-40%, respectively. Amino acid sequence alignments between avian and mammalian CD3 revealed maximum conservation in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as well as in the regions flanking the cysteine residues in the extracellular domain, underlining their functional importance. The difficulty of unambiguously assigning this chain to a single mammalian CD3 subunit on the basis of sequence comparison raises the possibility that this polypeptide represents a derivative from an ancestral form of the gamma and delta chains. It is thus possible that a single chain may play the role of both CD3 gamma and delta subunits in the chicken CD3 complex or, alternatively, that gene duplications occurred independently in the avian and mammalian lineages. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Nerve fibers containing noradrenaline (NA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin (GAL), substance P (SP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) occurred around blood vessels and follicles. Many of these transmitter candidates coexisted with each other in different combinations in different subpopulations of neurones. Injection of the retrograde tracer True Blue into the thyroid gland labelled cell bodies in the thyroid ganglion, the laryngeal ganglion, the superior cervical ganglion, the jugular-nodose ganglionic complex, the dorsal root ganglia (C2-C5) and the trigeminal ganglion. Judging from the number of labelled nerve cell bodies, the superior cervical ganglion and the thyroid ganglion contribute most to the thyroid innervation, while the laryngeal ganglion and the trigeminal ganglion contribute least. Results from denervation and tracer experiments indicate that all NA-containing and the majority of NPY-containing nerve fibers in the thyroid derive from the superior cervical ganglion. All VIP- and a minor population of NPY- and GAL-containing fibers in the thyroid gland originate in the thyroid ganglion. Nerve fibers containing GAL, SP and/or CGRP emanate from the jugular, cervical dorsal root and/or trigeminal ganglia. Together the findings indicate that several ganglia project to the thyroid and that many neuropeptides may be involved in the control of thyroid activity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

IL-4 is required for the generation of both primary polyclonal and secondary antigen-specific IgE responses in vivo. 2. IL-4 is required to maintain established, ongoing, antigen-specific and polyclonal IgE responses. 3. Most, but not all, polyclonal IgE production during a secondary immune response is IL-4-dependent. Memory B cells that have already switched to IgE at the DNA level may no longer require stimulation with IL-4 to be induced to secrete IgE. 4. The generation of a secondary IgE response is not dependent upon the presence of IL-4 during primary immunization. However, if IL-4 is not present during primary immunization, it is required during secondary immunization for the generation of an IgE response. 5. IL-4 does not appear to be required for the generation of in vivo IgG1 responses, and in at least some instances, does not contribute significantly to the generation of IgG1 responses in vivo. 6. A late-acting form of T-cell help other than IL-4 appears to be required for the generation of an IgE, but not an IgG1 response. 7. An antibody that inhibits IL-4 binding to IL-4 receptors affects Ig isotype selection in the same way as an antibody that neutralizes IL-4. 8. IFN-gamma can act in both spontaneous and induced immune responses to suppress IgE production. 9. IFN-gamma can also suppress IgG1 production and stimulate IgG2a production. However, IFN-gamma appears to suppress polyclonal IgG1 responses more than antigen-specific IgG1 responses, and it enhances, but is not required for, the generation of IgG2a responses. 10. IFN-alpha appears to resemble IFN-gamma in its ability to inhibit IgE and enhance IgG2a responses in GaM delta-injected mice, but it requires the presence of IFN-gamma to suppress IgG1 production in these mice. 11. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma appear to be able to decrease IgE production in some human patients. 12. There is no direct evidence that IL-5 contributes to the generation of in vivo antibody responses. Two general conclusions may also be drawn.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Average age at onset was 27.0 years for white men, 27.7 for white women, and 27.5 for black men. The unexpectedly older age for women is attributed to their older age at entry into service. When the coterminous United States was divided into three horizontal tiers of states, we found a strong effect of geography on age at onset. By state of residence at entry into active duty (EAD), white men had an average age at onset of 26.4 years in the northern tier, 27.3 years in the middle, and 28.8 years in the south. Trends were similar for white women and black men. Migrants, defined as those whose birth and EAD tiers differed, showed increasing ages at onset with southward moves. A statistical model used to discriminate between the influence of birth and EAD tiers on age at onset confirmed the significant effect of EAD alone. These data are compatible with the theses that the cause of MS is less common (or less efficient) in locations where the clinical disease is less common, and that its acquisition therefore occurs at an older age in those locales. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

In the present study, immobilization of the rat hindlimb for 6 h resulted in a significant 27% decrease in the absolute rate of cytochrome c synthesis in the red quadriceps muscle, without any change in the relative amount of cytochrome c mRNA. Cytochrome c mRNA in normal red quadriceps muscle was observed to be of four different lengths (1400, 1050, 650 and 580 bases). After 7 days of immobilization, the absolute rate of cytochrome c synthesis remained depressed and cytochrome c mRNA decreased by 40%; each of the cytochrome c mRNAs decreased, with a preferential disappearance of the 1050- and 1400-base lengths. Immobilization was ended on day 7, and the atrophied muscle was allowed to recover. At day 4 of recovery, the absolute rate of cytochrome c synthesis was 92% higher and the amount of cytochrome c mRNA had returned to control values. The abundances of the 1050- and 1400-base cytochrome c mRNAs had increased more than the shorter cytochrome c mRNAs, so that they were higher than control values. It appears that acute decreases in contractile activity of the red quadriceps muscle alter cytochrome c synthesis rates via translational or post-translational mechanisms, whereas chronic periods of modified contractile activity alter its synthesis rate via pre-translational mechanisms. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Endothelin (ET) has been shown to reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) and may therefore be a possible mediator of the reduction of GFR and RBF observed in post-ischaemic acute renal failure. 2. We infused a specific ET antibody, i.v., for 1 h before and 1 h after a 60 min period of renal ischemia by clamping the renal artery, and observed the changes in renal function (acute clearance and long-term metabolic cage studies) compared with rats infused with non-immune rabbit serum. 3. In acute and long-term studies, better renal function, as judged by GFR and RBF was observed in rats treated with the ET antibody. Furthermore, ischaemic rats showed higher levels of plasma immunoreactive ET (7.02 +/- 1.17 pg ET (ml plasma)-1; mean +/- S.E.M.) than normal rats where it was undetected. 4. We previously reported that glomeruli and renal platelet-activating factor (PAF) production were increased after renal ischaemia. So, we studied the possible relationship between ET and glomeruli or renal PAF production in post-ischaemic acute renal failure. 5. Glomeruli from ischaemic rats produced greater amounts of PAF than glomeruli from normal or anti-ET antibody-treated ischaemic rats. In addition, total renal PAF production was higher in ischaemic-untreated than in non-ischaemic or anti-ET-treated rats. Glomeruli incubated with 10(-7) M-endothelin produced much more PAF than those incubated in control conditions (138.4 +/- 10.5 vs. 80.2 +/- 9.4 pg PAF (mg protein)-1; means +/- S.E.M.; n = 10). 6. In conclusion, the present study suggests that endothelin plays a role in the persistent renal vasoconstriction that characterizes post-ischaemic acute renal failure. In addition, the observed increase in glomerular PAF production after renal ischaemia may be due to the action of endothelin. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

LSF is a subline of the L-strain of mouse transformed fibroblasts adapted to continuous growth is serum-free medium. Proliferation of LSF cells in monolayer on solid substratum was almost similar in serum-containing and in serum-free media. However, several other characters were found to be altered by the addition of serum to the serum-free medium: ability of cells to form colonies in semi-solid medium increased considerably; agglutinability of cells by Concanavalin A increased; uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose by the cells increased considerably; ability of cells to metabolize benzo (a) pyrene was inhibited; cell morphology was altered and, in particular, the cells became less spread on the substratum and density of microvilli on the cell surface increased. All these changes induced by serum were reversed by transfer of the cells back into serum-free medium. Thus, addition of serum increased the expression of a number of cellular traits characteristic of transformed phenotype, while in serum-free medium partial phenotypic reversion of transformation was observed. A possible role of serum in the expression of the transformed phenotype is discussed. It is pointed out that cell lines adapted to growth in serum-free medium provide an experimental system convenient for analysis of the effects of different serum components on the cell phenotype. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Although the male urethra is a proposed reservoir of HPV transmission, the association between HPV and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the male urethra has not been studied. The highly sensitive technique of polymerase chain reaction with type-specific HPV 16 and 18 primers and general primers, including nine other genotypes was used to survey a series of SCC of the male urethra for the prevalence of an association with HPV. Archival surgical specimens from 14 patients were analyzed, and primary, recurrent, and metastatic lesions from 4 (29%) patients contained HPV 16 DNA. No other HPV genotype (6b, 11, 13, 18, 30, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51) was detected. Complete concordance for the presence of HPV in primary and recurrent or metastatic disease was demonstrated. These findings strongly suggest that HPV type 16 is associated with a substantial subset of SCCs of the male urethra. Analysis of clinical data revealed that HPV-positive tumors had a significant predilection for location in the pendulous urethra versus the bulbar urethra. Survival data analysis showed that the presence of HPV more closely correlated with prolonged survival than did tumor location. The presence or absence of HPV 16 DNA defines two subsets of SCC of the male urethra which differ in the site of occurrence and, possibly, progression. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Freshly isolated glands retained their in vivo morphology. On maintenance, the glands retained their freshly isolated rates of cell division, but the sebocytes showed increased keratinization and there was multilayering of the peripheral undifferentiated cells. However, glands maintained in the presence of 1 microM-13-cis retinoic acid showed very little luminal keratinization and only a small degree of multilayering. On autoradiography, freshly isolated glands retained their in vivo pattern of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation. Similar patterns were seen when glands were maintained for 7 days with or without testosterone. However, in the presence of both testosterone and 13-cis retinoic acid there was only slight graining. Following 7 days maintenance the rate of lipogenesis fell significantly. This was partially reversed by testosterone, but further inhibited by 13-cis retinoic acid. The patterns of lipids that are synthesised after a week's maintenance are very similar to those seen in freshly isolated glands, except that the squalene:cholesterol ratio is reversibly regulated by 3 microM-testosterone and 1 microM-retinoic acid. Protein synthesis was maintained at the same rates as for freshly isolated glands under all conditions of maintenance. Whereas DNA synthetic rates were maintained in the presence of testosterone, they were significantly inhibited by 13-cis retinoic acid. Glandular wet weights were retained under all conditions of maintenance, except that they were significantly reduced by 13-cis retinoic acid. This study shows that human sebocytes continue to divide on organ maintenance, but that they do not differentiate fully. However, this provides the first demonstration that 13-cis retinoic acid acts on human sebaceous glands directly, reducing the rate of cell division and the rate of lipogenesis, which shows that the maintained human sebaceous gland might provide a useful model for studying the effect of 13-cis retinoic acid on human sebocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Changes in pH were induced by changes in the CO2 concentration aerating Krebs' solution. In the absence of muscle relaxants, an increase in CO2 from 5% to 7.5% decreased (P less than 0.01) indirectly elicited twitch tension by 5.4 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- SEM), while a decrease in CO2 from 5% to 2.5% increased (P less than 0.01) twitch tension by 2.3 +/- 0.7%. With a change in CO2 from 2.5% to 7.5%, partial neuromuscular blockade produced by d-Tc or vecuronium was augmented (P less than 0.01), while that produced by metocurine, pancuronium, or alcuronium was reduced (P less than 0.01). With the change in CO2 from 7.5% to 2.5%, the neuromuscular blockade produced by d-Tc or vecuronium was reduced (P less than 0.01), while that produced by metocurine, pancuronium, or alcuronium was augmented (P less than 0.01). Dose-response study showed that 2.5% CO2 shifted the dose-response curves for d-Tc and vecuronium to the right (P less than 0.01) from those with 5% CO2, whereas 7.5% CO2 shifted them to the left (P less than 0.05). In contrast, neither 2.5% CO2 or 7.5% CO2 significantly shifted the dose-response curves for metocurine or pancuronium from those with 5% CO2. Their dose-response curves with 2.5% CO2 were to the left, instead of to the right, of those with 7.5% CO2 (P less than 0.01).\\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The microsphere method was employed and designed so that recirculating microspheres across the peripheral arteriovenous anastomoses were prevented from lodging in the left lung, and disturbances of the isovolemic state of the animals became minimal. Under normal conditions with a mean arterial pressure of 115 +/- 2 mmHg (n = 40), the bronchial blood flow of the left lung was found to be 0.307 +/- 0.033 ml/min on average, and amounted to 0.52 +/- 0.06% of the cardiac output. The flow (ml/min) normalized per kg body weight, 100 g wet lung, or 100 g dry lung was 1.14 +/- 0.12, 76 +/- 8, or 368 +/- 39, respectively. The total intrapulmonary bronchial blood flow of the left and right lungs could be estimated by multiplying the intrapulmonary bronchial flow of the left lung by the weight ratio (total:left) of 2.9. The variability of the flow data was small, as confirmed in a study with simultaneous injection of two differently radiolabeled microspheres. The reproducibility of duplicate measurements was excellent. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Our purpose was to evaluate the Revised Trauma Index (RTI) as a triage tool for both its severity prediction ability and triage accuracy. A total of 2,340 trauma admissions were evaluated using the RTI and the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The data were submitted to standardized statistical analysis and compared to other published data for under and overtriage. Our results show a linear correlation between the RTI and the ISS with a correlation coefficient of .62. There is 5% death rate at an RTI level of 15, which yields a 5% undertriage rate for death and a 37.3% overtriage rate for predicting an ISS greater than 15. This compares to under and overtriage rates for the Trauma Score, CRAMS, Pre-Hospital Index, and Mechanism of Injury scales varying from 19% to 56% undertriage and 7% to 82% overtriage. We reached the following conclusions. a) The RTI is a simple, fast triage tool for predicting major trauma. b) The RTI is related to the ultimate ISS. c) Use of an RTI greater than or equal to 15 results in an acceptable undertriage rate, with a better rate for overtriage than existing scores. d) Therefore, we recommend the RTI for use in emergency medical direction and bypass protocols. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Two major aspects of fluoride action are (i) the inhibition of demineralization at the crystal surfaces within the tooth, and (ii) the enhancement of subsurface remineralization resulting in arrestment or reversal of caries lesions. Fluoride present in the aqueous phase at the apatite crystal surface may play a determining role in the inhibition of enamel or dentin demineralization. In one part of the present study, the initial dissolution rate of synthetic carbonated-apatite in acetate buffers was measured with fluoride present in the buffer in the 0-2.6 mmol/L (0-50 ppm) range. Inhibition of demineralization was shown to be a logarithmic function of the fluoride concentration in solution. In the second part of the present study, an in vitro pH-cycling model was used for determination of the effect on net de/remineralization of enamel by treatment solutions containing fluoride in the 0-26 mmol/L (0-500 ppm) range. The net mineral loss was shown to be negatively related to the logarithm of the fluoride concentration. These studies have demonstrated an exponential quantitative relationship between fluoride concentration and inhibition of apatite demineralization or enhancement of remineralization. The clinical implications are (i) that simply increasing fluoride concentration may not necessarily give increased cariostatic benefit, and (ii) that improving the means of delivery of relatively low fluoride concentrations for longer times should be more appropriate for enhancing clinical efficacy. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Surgical creation of such artificially vascularized isolated bowel segments is of interest to researchers for a variety of studies, and may be useful in the treatment of short bowel syndrome, allowing longitudinal division of the remaining small bowel to double its length. We created four surgical variants to study the ability of the collateral blood supply to maintain mucosal integrity in the presence or absence of normal luminal contents. In all groups, a collateral blood supply was created in a 5- to 7-cm segment of adult rat jejunum by hepatoenteropexy (Iowa model II). In Thiry-Vella (T-V) and isolated bowel segment (IBS) rats, this segment was exteriorized at both ends to exclude luminal contents. Control and IBS in continuity (IBS-C) loops were left in continuity. The mesentery of IBS and IBS-C rats was divided 5 weeks later, leaving the experimental segment entirely dependent on the collateral circulation. All animals were harvested at 7 weeks after the initial surgery. Tissues were analyzed for mucosal weight, protein content per centimeter of bowel, length of villi, depth of crypts, DNA content, and sucrase activity. We found that segments retaining luminal continuity had significantly higher mucosal weight and DNA content per centimeter of bowel compared with exteriorized loops. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Semilogarithmic plots of the decay phase of sodium currents show two phases and analysis yields a fast (tau h1) and a slow (tau h2) time constant. At increased depolarization the contribution of tau h2 is decreased. Increasing the temperature from 22.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C to 36.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C influences tau h1 and tau h2 to the same extent. The Q10 values were 2.28 +/- 0.32 for tau h1 and 2.46 +/- 0.35 (mean +/- SD) for tau h2. Between -50 and -20 mV the time course of current decay is substantially faster than inactivation induced by prepulses. Onset of inactivation by the prepulse protocol needs two time constants (tau c1, tau c2) for a satisfactory description. Both decrease steeply with increasing depolarization. For small depolarizations, tau c2 values are in the range of several seconds. Recovery from inactivation by short prepulses (40 ms) could be described by two exponentials (tau r1, tau r2). For longer prepulses (1,000 ms) a very slow component, tau r3, was observed indicating a history dependence of inactivation. Delay time constants for the onset of inactivation (tau dc) are determined between -50 and -20 mV. The more depolarizing voltages generate smaller delay times (0.55 +/- 0.10 ms at -20 mV, mean +/- SD) but larger deviations from the exponential time course. Delay in recovery from inactivation (time constant tau dr) has the value 2.0 +/- 0.7 ms (mean +/- SD) at -80 mV and decreases at more hyperpolarizing potentials. The remaining series resistance at maximum compensation was calculated as 80 k omega. Its influence on the sensitive delay in the double pulse inactivation is discussed. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

This protein is transiently expressed at the cell surface of the peripherally projecting neurons, i.e. motoneurons of the spinal cord and cranial nuclei, sensory neurons of the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia and sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric neurons. In vitro cultures of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia have shown that BEN is expressed on neurons but not on glial cells. On motor and sensory neurons, BEN first appears at the level of the cell body just after withdrawal from the cell cycle. Soon afterwards, expression of the antigen extends to the elongating axon. After a few days, BEN is no longer expressed by the motor and sensory neurons, disappearing first from the cell body and then progressively from the fibres. The loss of expression is concomitant with the onset of intense proliferation of satellite and Schwann cells. This modulated expression within the nervous system is unlike that of any surface glycoprotein so far described in vertebrates. Preliminary biochemical analysis indicates that, although it bears the adhesion-associated epitope HNK-1, BEN does not share characteristics with any previously described axonal glycoprotein. Consequently, we speculate that this glycoprotein might be a novel molecule implicated in selective adhesion phenomena, such as axonal fasciculation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The recombinant TNF mutants were compared to the wild type TNF in assays using crude bacterial lysates, for protein yield, solubility, subunit trimerization, receptor binding inhibition activity, and in vitro cytotoxic activity. All mutants which did not form cross-linkable trimer also showed little cytotoxic activity or receptor binding inhibition activity, indicating that trimer formation is obligatory for TNF-alpha activity. Most mutations of internal residues yielded no cross-linkable trimer, while most mutations of surface residues yielded cross-linkable trimer. Mutations at surface residues Leu29, Arg31, and Ala35 yielded cross-linkable trimers with good activities, except proline substitutions which may cause conformational changes in the polypeptide chain. This suggested that these residues are near the receptor binding site. Mutations at other strictly conserved internal residues such as Ser60, His78, and Tyr119 form cross-linkable trimer with little activity. These mutations may indirectly affect the receptor binding site by forming trimers with undetectable abnormalities. Mutants of surface residues Tyr87, Ser95, Ser133, and Ser147 affect receptor binding and cytotoxic activity but not trimer formation, suggesting that these residues are involved directly in receptor binding. The fact that residues Arg31, Ala35, Tyr87, Ser95, and Ser147, located on the opposite sides of a monomer, are clustered at the intersubunit grooves of TNF trimer supports the current notion that TNF receptor binding sites are trivalent and are located at the three intersubunit grooves. However, our finding that Ser133, which is outside the groove, can also be involved directly in receptor binding suggested that the receptor binding sites of TNF may not be confined to the intersubunit grooves, but extended to include additional surface residues. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The v-ski sequence contains a single open translational reading frame that encodes a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 49,000 daltons. The predicted amino acid sequence includes nuclear localization motifs that have been identified in other nuclear oncoproteins. It also contains a proline-rich region and a set of cysteine and histidine residues that could constitute a metal-binding domain. Two regions of the amino acid sequences of v-ski and v-myc are related, and the two proteins exhibit similar distributions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. Cloned segments of the chicken c-ski proto-oncogene totaling 65 kilobases have been analyzed, and regions related to v-ski have been sequenced. The results indicate that v-ski is derived from at least five coding exons of c-ski, that it is correctly spliced, and that it is missing c-ski coding sequences at both its 5' and 3' ends. The c-ski and avian leukosis virus sequences that overlap the 5' virus/v-ski junction in Sloan-Kettering virus contain an 18-of-20-base sequence match that presumably played a role in the transduction of ski by facilitating virus/c-ski recombination. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The intervention was designed to increase understanding of parental illness and resilience in the children. The authors studied the first seven families (14 parents) to receive the intervention. Enrollment criteria included affective disorder during the preceding year in at least one parent, presence of at least one child between the ages of 8 and 14 years who was not psychiatrically ill at the time of participation, and willingness to participate in the research study. The intervention consisted of parent, child, and family sessions. Assessment included semistructured interviews with parents about affective disorders, standard ratings of marital satisfaction and therapeutic alliance, and a recently developed semistructured interview to assess response to the intervention. Overall satisfaction with the intervention was rated moderate to high by parents. No harm was reported. Ten of 14 parent subjects reported five or more behavior and attitude changes that they attributed to the intervention. The most frequent behavior and attitudinal changes reported were increased discussion of the illness and related issues and increased understanding of information about affective illness. The authors conclude that the intervention is safe and feasible in families with parental affective disorder. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In patients with early tumors, bone biopsies were generally normal and the hypercalcemia was due to an elevation in renal tubular resorption of calcium. Conversely, osteoclastic resorption was markedly increased in patients with advanced tumors, particularly those in whom the biopsies were obtained postmortem. Osteoclast surface (Oc.S) correlated positively with the stage of tumor progression (r = 0.80, p less than 0.002), degree of immobility (r = 0.87, p less than 0.002), and level of urinary cyclic AMP excretion (r = 0.60, p less than 0.02). When compared with a group of ambulant patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), osteoblast surface (Ob.S%) in HHM was depressed (median and range): 1.2% (0-11.6%) versus 5.3% (1.1-32.0%) (p less than 0.001). However, a relatively low Ob.S (4%) and raised Oc.S (43.5%) were also seen in an immobilized patient with severe HPT. These data suggest that the PTH-related peptides currently invoked in the pathogenesis of HHM may initially cause hypercalcemia by enhancing renal tubular calcium resorption. The increase in osteoclastic activity and depression of osteoblastic activity that subsequently occurs is probably due to the combined effects of immobilization and higher circulating levels of PTHrP on the skeleton. However, the release of other bone-resorbing factors by the tumor, which have a depressant effect on osteoblastic activity, remains possible. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The competitive binding assay was carried out with 22 concentrations of unlabelled insulin. Binding data were analysed by a non-linear direct model fitting procedure assuming one non-cooperative binding site. Maximum specific binding was unchanged in the total collective of gestational diabetic women, but was decreased by 30% in those treated with diet (6.2 +/- 2.2%) and increased by 90% in insulin-treated women (16.4 +/- 10.2%) as compared to the control subjects (8.7 +/- 2.5%). The diet-treated women had only 40% as many and those treated with insulin had more than twice as many receptors compared to control subjects on a per mg protein basis and if expressed per total placenta. In patients with overt diabetes mellitus maximum specific binding (18.5 +/- 10.6%) was higher (p less than 0.05) due to more receptors compared to control subjects but was similar to the insulin-treated gestational diabetic patients. Maximum specific binding and receptor concentrations did not correlate linearly with maternal plasma insulin levels. Receptor affinities were virtually similar in all groups (1.8 x 10(9) l/mol). The placental glycogen content was reduced (p less than 0.05) to about 80% of that of control subjects in the diet-treated collective, whereas it was unchanged compared to control subjects in the insulin-treated gestational diabetic women despite a 40% increase (p less than 0.001) of the maternal-to-cord serum glucose ratio. In overt diabetic patients the maternal-to-cord serum glucose ratio and the placental glycogen content were higher (p less than 0.05) than in the control subjects. We conclude that trophoblast plasma membranes from gestational diabetic women treated with diet alone express less and those from women treated with insulin express more insulin receptors than those from a healthy control group in vitro. These differences could not have been disclosed without consideration of the mode of treatment. Trophoblast plasma membranes from overt diabetic women have more insulin receptors than those from healthy control subjects. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Renal failure was severe enough to require dialysis in 24 cases, while the remaining 5 patients showed serum creatinine levels greater than 5 mg/dl. The patients were randomly allocated to Group I (15 patients undergoing plasma exchange together with corticosteroids, cytotoxic drug, hemodialysis only when needed) or to Group II (14 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis together with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drug). In Group I Bence-Jones proteinuria decreased dramatically (P less than 0.01) with a significant increase in urine output (P less than 0.001), while Group II presented a slight reduction in Bence-Jones proteinuria without a significant increase in daily diuresis. Thirteen out the 15 Group I patients recovered renal function reaching serum creatinine levels less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl in most cases. Only two patients in Group II improved renal failure well enough to stop dialysis. The one-year survival rate was significantly higher in Group I (66%) than in Group II (28%, P less than 0.01). We conclude that plasma exchange associated to chemotherapy rapidly removes large amounts of light chains, improves both renal function and long-term survival expectancies. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The current study was designed to examine the effect of both physiologic and pharmacologic plasma levels of ANF on bronchial reactivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects. A total of eight atopic men with well-controlled asthma were studied, mean (SD) FEV1 3.50 (0.73) L, equivalent to 87 (11)% of predicted; bronchial reactivity as measured by histamine PC20 was 0.77 mg/ml (geometric mean). On four separate study days infusions of 1, 3, or 10 pmol/kg/min of ANF or placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized manner. Once steady-state plasma levels had been achieved, measurement of bronchial reactivity was repeated. Mean (SEM) basal ANF level was 18.5 (3.5) pg/ml and rose to 41 (4.3), 157 (15), and 500 (30) pg/ml with increasing doses of ANF. With placebo infusion geometric mean histamine PC20 was 0.77 mg/ml and rose to 1.15 mg/ml (p less than 0.05), 1.90 mg/ml (p less than 0.001), and 3.38 mg/ml (p less than 0.001), corresponding to a 1.5-, 2.5-, and 4.4-fold protection with respective ANF infusions.

Data were obtained from middle-aged (15 mo) and senescent (24 mo) Sprague-Dawley rats either 1 or 3 mo after the initiation of one-kidney figure-8 renal wrap (Grollman) hypertension. Peak left ventricular (LV) function assessed during acute volume expansion was not markedly affected 1 mo after induction of hypertension with the exception of a decrement in the acceleration of aortic flow (dF/dt) in the senescent hypertensive group. Three months after the surgery was performed, peak LV function (stroke index, stroke volume/g LV, and dF/dt) was depressed in the senescent hypertensive rats, compared with the controls. In contrast, these indexes in the 15-mo-old rats were similar in the experimental and control groups after either 1 or 3 mo of hypertension. Developed pressure, however, was not compromised by hypertension at either age. Cardiocyte hypertrophy due to pressure overload occurred in both age groups but to a greater extent in the senescent group. This cellular response did not cause an absolute increase in LV mass and was associated with endomyocardial foci of cellular degeneration and fibrosis suggestive of cell loss. Mitochondria-to-myofibril volume ratios were not significantly altered in the experimental groups at either age, thus the cellular hypertrophy in these rats was characterized by uniform organelle growth. These data support two important conclusions regarding late onset hypertension.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Even though most of the subjects periodically experienced climacteric symptoms, no hormonal supplementation was given. The serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), oestradiol and oestrone that were recorded essentially confirmed previous data obtained in cross-sectional studies. Within the 6-mth period around the menopause the serum levels of testosterone and androstenedione showed small but significant decreases of 18 and 16%, respectively. These decreases continued over the following years and amounted to about 30% after 3 yr. In contrast, neither the mean level of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) nor the DHA/DHA sulphate (DHAS) ratio changed significantly at the menopause, but DHA and DHAS concentrations declined slowly by about 20% over the 7-yr observation period. The mean level of DHAS showed an isolated increase during the last few months before the menopause. A similar, although not significant, increase was also seen in DHA and testosterone levels. After the first post-menopausal year a significant positive correlation was found between the levels of oestrone and androstenedione. This longitudinal study of individual women appeared to lend itself well to the investigation of even subtle hormonal fluctuations during the gradual transition to an established post-menopausal pattern. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

(3) Detectable manifestations derived from (1) and (2) which are expressed inward as perceptions and outward as behaviour.

Without sensory inputs, the mind will not be structured and cannot appear. Without manifestations of inner perceptions and outward motor expression, the mind cannot be recognized by the individual or the environment. Transmaterial entities require the existence of supporting matter and may be represented by patterns of material organization or by temporal or functional relations between parts of the material substratum. They may transcend the existence of specific materials, changing carriers while preserving their nonmaterial identity, but do not possess intrinsic properties of matter such as mass and energy.

To measure total effective vascular compliance, a reflection of the properties of the venous system, rapid volume expansion (300 ml of a gelatin solution in 3 min) was performed in 23 patients. Eleven patients had compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade A or B), and eight had decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade C). Four control patients had mild chronic hepatitis, normal hepatic venous pressure and normal liver architecture. Cardiac index, hepatic venous pressures, hepatic and azygos blood flow and renal plasma flow were measured before and immediately after volume expansion. Right atrial pressure was recorded during volume expansion. This allowed the calculation of total effective vascular compliance, which was higher in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in those with compensated cirrhosis (4.65 +/- 4.21 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.63 ml.mm Hg-1.kg-1; p less than 0.05).

The primary structures of the protein in two variants, Gilliam and Karp, have been reported independently by us and Stover et al. by cloning and sequencing the corresponding genes (Ohashi, N., Nashimoto, H., Ikeda, H., and Tamura, A. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 91, 119-122; Stover, C. K., Marana, D. P., Carter, J. M., Roe, B. A., Mardis, E., and Oaks, E. V. (1990) Infect. Immun. 58, 2076-2084). In the present study, genes encoding the TSA homologues of the other four variants, Kato, Kawasaki, Kuroki, and Shimokoshi, which are all distinguishable serologically, were cloned and sequenced, and consequently, it became possible to compare the primary structures of the six antigenic variants. The sequence analyses revealed a complete open reading frame encoding 55,308-56,745-dalton proteins with 521-532 amino acids, in which a putative signal peptide consisting of 22 amino acids was recognized at the NH2-terminal end. Transcription of the gene is regulated by several tandem promoters. All TSA molecules have the characteristics of transmembrane proteins with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, and contain four variable domains with spans of 16-40 amino acids which are located in the hydrophilic regions in the molecule and show different amino acid sequences among the strains. Phylogenetic classification among the R. tsutsugamushi strains based on TSA homologues supports the antigenic relationships known in the closely and distantly related strains. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Mutant cDNAs were isolated, characterized by sequencing, and cloned in an expression vector under control of the simian virus-40 (SV40) early promoter. The constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells, and the mutant proteins, secreted into the culture medium, were analyzed for IGF binding by ligand blotting. The results obtained show that deletion of the C-terminal 20 amino acids or introduction of frame-shifts in this region resulted in loss of IGF binding and for some mutants in the formation of dimeric IGFBP-1 molecules. These dimers are probably formed when cysteine-226 (Cys-226) is missing, and its putative partner is able to form intermolecular disulfide bonds. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that most of the introduced point mutations in the C-terminal region did not affect IGF binding. Only mutation of Cys-226 to tyrosine completely abolished IGF binding, as did the introduction of a negatively charged amino acid in the vicinity of this residue. Again, dimers were observed, supporting that Cys-226 is essential for the conformation of IGFBP-1. In addition, our data suggest that an IGF-binding domain may be located in the vicinity of the intramolecular disulfide bond formed by Cys-226 and its putative partner. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The ovine FSH receptor did not discriminate between FSH of different species, although equine FSH was more reactive. In the same tissue, however, the LH receptor showed marked preference for ovine and bovine LH, reacting very weakly with other preparations of pituitary LH. Human chorionic gonadotrophin also reacted partly with the ovine LH receptor at 25 degrees C. However, at 4 degrees C, the optimum temperature for binding of the LH receptor to its homologous hormone, the receptor displayed no recognition for chorionic gonadotrophin preparations. Affinity cross-linking studies with ovine testicular membrane suggested that the ovine FSH receptor has an Mr of 70,000, which is very similar to that observed in the porcine ovary. The Mr of the ovine LH receptor was estimated to be 150,000, which is different from those of other mammalian species, including those that have been cloned. The data suggest that the binding and structural properties of the ovine FSH receptor are similar to those of other mammalian FSH receptors, whereas the ovine LH receptor appears to differ from other mammalian LH receptors in having a different Mr and in being more stringent in its requirement for pituitary LH. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 3-week swimming training programme would increase muscle glycogen stores in rats fed a high-fat (FAT) diet in resting conditions. Rats were fed either the FAT or CHO diet for 7 days ad libitum, and then were fed regularly twice a day (between 0800 and 0830 hours and 1800 and 1830 hours) for 32 days. During this period of regular feeding, half of the rats in both dietary groups had swimming training for 3 weeks and the other half were sedentary. The rats were not exercised for 48 h before sacrifice. All rats were killed 2 h after their final meal (2030 hours). The glycogen contents in red gastrocnemius muscle, heart and liver were significantly higher in sedentary rats fed the CHO diet than in those fed the FAT diet. Exercise training clearly increased glycogen content in soleus, red gastrocnemius and heart muscle in rats fed the CHO diet. In rats fed the FAT diet, however, training did not increase glycogen content in these muscles or the heart. Exercise training resulted in an 87% increase of total glycogen synthase activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats fed the CHO diet. However, this was not observed in rats fed the FAT diet. The total glycogen phosphorylase activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats of both dietary groups was increased approximately twofold by training.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

PR107 was expressed alone or fused in phase to the amino or carboxy terminus of the bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). The yield of protease and beta-gal was found to be significantly higher when the gene for PR107 was cloned upstream of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (PR107-beta-gal). Comparisons of the level of cloned protein expression between protease precursor and mature form suggested that this enhanced expression was due to the additional 5' sequence of the PR107 gene, and occurred at the post-transcriptional level. Autoprocessing of protease precursor and its release from the beta-gal fusion protein were analysed using wild-type and mutated cleavage sites. Mutations were introduced at amino acids downstream of the F-P scissile bond, at positions P4' and P5' in the C-terminal site (TLNF*PISP), and at position P3' in a consensus N-terminal site (TLNF*PQITL) placed at the protease-beta-gal junction. The data obtained suggested that (i) autoprocessing at the carboxy-terminal F-P bond was not significantly influenced by the presence of the N-terminal precursor sequence, (ii) P4' and P5' substitutions in the C-terminal site had no effect on cleavage, and (iii) P3' in the N-terminal site tolerated a wide variety of substitutions. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Sixteen morbidly obese and 14 normal-weight subjects (body mass index, 51.2 +/- 11.5 v 22.1 +/- 2.2 kg.m-2; mean +/- SD) were studied with sequential, low-dose, incremental insulin infusion with estimation of glucose turnover. In obese patients, basal plasma insulin was higher (10.5 +/- 3.8 v 2.4 +/- 3.0 mU.L-1, P less than .001) and remained elevated throughout infusion (F = 492, P less than .001), as did C-peptide (F = 22.7, P less than .001). Metabolic clearance rate for insulin (MCRI) at the highest infusion rate was similar (1,048 +/- 425 v 1,018 +/- 357 mL.m-2.min-1, NS). Basal hepatic glucose production in obese subjects was less than in normal-weight subjects (270 +/- 108 v 444 +/- 68 mumol.m-2.min-1, P less than .01), as was the basal metabolic clearance rate for glucose (MCRG, 77 +/- 26 v 108 +/- 31 mL.m-2.min-1, P less than .05). Insulin infusion caused blood glucose to decrease less in the obese patients (1.4 +/- 0.5 v 1.9 +/- 0.5 mmol.L-1, P less than .05); hepatic glucose production was appropriately suppressed in them by hyperinsulinemia, but their insulin-mediated glucose disposal was reduced (1.67 [0.79] v 4.45 [2.13] mL.m-2.min-1/mU.L-1, P less than .01).

Pretreatment of the cellulose acetate hollow fibers with collagen enhances the attachment of the anchorage-dependent cells.

The Hep G2 cells replicate and secrete CCM protein in quantities comparable to those produced in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The highest CCM protein productivity during the 80-day cultivation was 1.1 g/day with a total of 30 g of protein accumulated. Hep G2 CCM (20-40 micrograms protein/ml) was comparable to or even better than 10% FCS in supporting the growth of Molt-4 (a human T leukemia cell line) and FO (a mouse myeloma cell line) cells in vitro.

The rate of aromatization is stimulated 20- to 30-fold by glucocorticoids when fetal calf serum is present in the culture medium and by dibutyryl cyclic AMP in the absence of serum. The action of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to stimulate aromatase activity is potentiated markedly by phorbol esters and inhibited by growth factors, such as EGF. In order to investigate the mechanisms underlying this multifactorial regulation, we have prepared polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for aromatase cytochrome P-450. By use of these antibodies it was demonstrated that the action of these various factors to regulate aromatase activity was caused by alterations in the rate of synthesis of aromatase cytochrome P-450, whereas the synthesis of the reductase component of the aromatase enzyme complex was relatively unaffected. The changes in the rate of synthesis of aromatase cytochrome P-450 were, in turn, reflective of changes in the levels of translatable mRNA specific for this protein. In order to analyze the levels of aromatase cytochrome P-450 mRNA directly, we have isolated a cloned cDNA insert complementary to the mRNA encoding aromatase cytochrome P-450, by screening a lambda gt 11 human placental cDNA library utilizing the polyclonal anti-aromatase P-450 IgG. Use of this cDNA probe in Northern analysis of RNA extracted from human adipose stromal cells revealed that the changes in translatable mRNA resulting from incubation of the cells with the various regulatory factors were due to changes in the absolute levels of mRNA encoding this protein. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Treatment of intact rat PC12 cells with neuropeptides including secretin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase activity 2 to 3-fold in vitro. Secretin (EC50 = 10 nM) was about 3 orders of magnitude more potent than VIP (EC50 = 3 microM). A combination of several protease inhibitors failed to enhance the potency of either peptide. Other members of the secretin family including glucagon and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase activity to a lesser extent. Somatostatin, which is not homologous to secretin, was ineffective. The maximal response of tyrosine hydroxylase activation to 1 microM secretin occurred within 6-15 sec. Secretin, VIP, and forskolin also enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase activity (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine production) in intact cells, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. Secretin, VIP, PHI, and glucagon increased the levels of cAMP in PC12 cells more than 10-fold, as determined by radioimmunoassay. We also demonstrated that cAMP is released from the cells into the incubation medium following secretin treatment. Secretin and VIP treatment also enhanced the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a concentration-dependent fashion, as measured subsequently in vitro. Based on the greater potency of secretin in comparison with VIP, PHI, and glucagon, we suggest that the PC12 cells contain a secretin-preferring receptor that increases cAMP levels and brings about an activation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity through the stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

An initial study determined doses of TP and GH which would result in a synergistic response. Hypophysectomized male rats, approximately 40 days of age, received GH at doses of 5, 25 and 62.5 micrograms/day administered in two injections/day at 08.00 and 16.00 h. At all doses of GH, administration of TP at 100 micrograms/day significantly enhanced the GH-stimulated rate of growth. This growth enhancement by TP was greatest in combination with GH at 25 micrograms/day. In a subsequent study, growth responses to 25 micrograms GH/day and 100 micrograms TP/day were examined in animals with differing degrees of sexual differentiation. Sex groups were: intact males, males castrated at 11 days of age and females administered 100 micrograms TP at 3 days of age (masculinized rats), and males castrated at 2 days of age and normal females (non-masculinized rats). In all sex groups, growth of hypophysectomized rats was stimulated by GH. Genetic sex and masculinization did not influence the response to GH. Masculinized hypophysectomized rats exhibited significantly greater rates of growth and final live, empty body, liver and kidney weights than non-masculinized hypophysectomized rats. All sex groups other than normal females responded synergistically to the combination treatment of GH plus TP. Rats that experienced neonatal exposure to testosterone became programmed to respond to testosterone and demonstrated greater rates of growth and body and organ weights when administered the combination of GH plus TP. These data indicate that TP synergizes with GH to promote growth of hypophysectomized rats appropriately programmed to respond.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Accordingly, arterial blood was perfused into the coronary circulation in 16 dogs. In Group 1 dogs (n = 8), blood flow to the cannulated left circumflex artery was controlled with use of a roller pump, whereas in Group 2 dogs (n = 8) blood flow to the left anterior descending coronary artery was controlled by a hydraulic occluder placed around it. Sonicated microbubbles (mean size 4 microns) were used as the contrast agent. In Group 1 dogs the microbubbles were injected subselectively into the left circumflex artery, whereas in Group 2 dogs they were injected selectively into the left main coronary artery and two-dimensional echocardiographic images were recorded. Computer-generated time-intensity curves were derived from these images and variables of these curves correlated with transmural blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. A gamma-variate function (y = Ate-alpha t) best described the curves, and alpha (a variable of curve width) correlated well with transmural blood flow at different flow rates in all Group 1 and Group 2 dogs (mean r = 0.81 and 0.97, respectively). Other variables of the curve width also correlated well with myocardial blood flow, but peak intensity had a poor correlation with myocardial blood flow in both groups of dogs (r = 0.39 and r = 0.63, respectively). When data from all dogs were pooled, Group 1 dogs still showed good correlation between variables of curve width and myocardial blood flow (r = 0.81); Group 2 dogs did not (r = 0.45). The difference between the two sets of dogs was related to the site of contrast agent injection. It is concluded that measurement of the transit time of microbubbles through the myocardium with two-dimensional echocardiography accurately reflects regional myocardial blood flow. Although injection of contrast agent selectively into the left main coronary artery only allows measurement of relative flow, it may be feasible to measure absolute flow by injecting contrast agent subselectively into a coronary artery. Myocardial contrast echocardiography may, therefore, offer the unique opportunity of simultaneously assessing regional myocardial perfusion and function in vivo. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Peptides were purified using a combination of reversed-phase and ion-exchange batch extraction procedures followed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. beta-Lipotropin (1-40) was found to consist of four major components while joining peptide was found to consist of two major components. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis of the tryptic fragments of both peptides revealed that the observed heterogeneity could be explained in terms of post-translational modifications. beta-Lipotropin (1-40) was found to be sulfated at tyrosine residue 28 to an extent of about 50%. The tyrosine residue in beta-lipotropin (1-40) is situated within an amino acid sequence with a preponderance of glutamate residues. Sulfation of this amino acid residue is entirely compatible with the known primary structure requirements of the sulfotransferase enzyme located in the trans-Golgi fraction. Both beta-lipotropin (1-40) and joining peptide were found to have pyroglutamate at their amino termini to an extent of about 50%. The cDNA sequence for bovine pro-opiomelanocortin predicts the presence of glutamic acid at position 1 of both peptides. Pyroglutamate is normally formed through the cyclization of glutamine. This reaction is thought to be catalyzed by a pyroglutamate forming enzyme located within the secretory granule fraction.

Glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate class participate in this process. Blocking those receptors interferes with activity-dependent refinement of maps in normal frogs and of ocular dominance bands in surgically produced animals with three eyes. Chronic application of N-methyl-D-aspartate sharpens the bands. The possibility that 5-amino-phosphonovaleric acid depresses tectal responsiveness was motivation for studying the effects of 5-amino-phosphonovaleric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate applied both chronically and acutely. We evaluated tectal responsiveness to visual input by presenting flashes of light to one eye and recording responses in the ipsilateral tectal lobe. This method reveals the output of the tectal cells contralateral to the stimulated eye. These cells project via the nucleus isthmi to the opposite tectal lobe. We also mapped the receptive field dimensions of the crossed isthmotectal axons. Our results show that acute topical application of 500 microM or 1 mM N-methyl-D-aspartate dramatically increases spontaneous activity, while 100 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate causes little change. Chronic treatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate at a low dose (estimated to be in the micromolar range) shown to influence retinotectal mapping, reduces response latencies but produces no statistically significant changes in tectal cell firing rates or receptive field size. Acute application of 5-amino-phosphonovaleric acid produces complex results: 10 microM produces no changes in firing, 100 microM 5-amino-phosphonovaleric acid decreases firing, and doses of 500-100 microM increase the firing.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Pinacidil (> or = 3 x 10(-7) M) hyperpolarized the membrane in a concentration-dependent manner, with a reduction in spontaneous spike discharges. The membrane hyperpolarization induced by pinacidil was consistently associated with an increase in membrane ionic conductance. Glybenclamide (10(-6) M) completely inhibited the membrane hyperpolarization induced by pinacidil (up to 10(-5) M). Membrane hyperpolarization with pinacidil was consistently greater in a low-K+ solution, and it decreased in the presence of a high-K+ solution, compared with that measured in normal Krebs solution. Pinacidil consistently suppressed carbachol-induced depolarization of the membrane, with a reduction in the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. Glybenclamide (10(-6) M) did not inhibit the effect of pinacidil on increased action potential frequency induced by carbachol but blocked the membrane hyperpolarization induced by pinacidil (10(-5) M). In addition, the amplitude and maximum velocity of depolarization of carbachol- and current-induced action potentials were significantly decreased by pinacidil in the presence of glybenclamide. These results suggest that pinacidil blocks action potential generation in detrusor smooth muscle by inducing membrane hyperpolarization secondary to an increase in K+ permeability. Pinacidil, at high concentrations (> or = 10(-5) M), might block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive Ca++ influx independently of hyperpolarization of the membrane. These mechanisms might be of benefit therapeutically in relaxation of unstable detrusor contractions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The administration of the drug caused some physiological effects, such as bradycardia and sedation of the monkeys. During a collection period of 120 hr, on average 83% was recovered after iv administration and 90% after p.o. dosing. After i.v. administration, 44% was excreted in the bile, as compared to 38% in the urine and about 1% in the feces. After oral administration, bile is the major excretion route, accounting for about 60% of the dose, as compared to 25% in the urine and about 5% in the feces. After ocular administration, on average 62% was recovered after 7 hr, excreted in bile and urine in about equal amounts. All percentages given above reflect the total amount of radioactivity recovered, thus comprising the unchanged drug plus various metabolites. After all three dosing routes, N-0437 was metabolized almost completely prior to elimination. Direct glucuronidation of the phenolic group proved to be the major metabolic pathway of N-0437, comprising about 44% of the dose after i.v. and ocular administration and 72% after oral dosing. Hydroxylation of N-0437 at the position ortho to the phenolic group present yielded a catechol intermediate, which was excreted as a glucuronide and accounted for about 10% of the dose. In the monkey, a clear regioselective preference towards glucuronidation at the 6-position was observed. Besides the glucuronide, the sulfoconjugate of N-0437 was a major metabolite after i.v. and ocular administration, accounting for about 15% of the dose.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Psychosocial stress has been shown to accelerate atherogenesis in animals, an effect probably mediated via beta-adrenoceptor activation. In view of the postulated roles of platelets and beta-adrenoceptor activation in atherosclerosis development, we decided to test whether beta blockade affects arterial platelet accumulation. We studied the accumulation of radioactivity from 111In-labelled platelets on the wall of the thoracic aorta of rabbits as a measure of platelet accumulation. During the exposure to the labelled platelets, the animals were also exposed to 3 hours of chloralose anesthesia. This is a reproducible model of experimental sympathetic activation, including beta-adrenoceptor activation, which we used to amplify possible effects of beta-blockade on platelet-vessel wall interaction. The effectiveness of the anesthesia in increasing sympathetic activity was verified by significant rises in mean arterial blood pressure (from 77 to 88 mmHg), heart rate (190 to 290 bpm), and plasma levels of norepinephrine (1.0 to 3.3 nM) and epinephrine (0.13 to 0.83 nM). In chloralose anesthetized rabbits, approximately 30 x 10(-9)% of the injected 111In accumulated in each square millimeter of intima at unbranched thoracic aorta. Platelet accumulation was significantly higher at arterial branching points, 70% higher at intercostal artery bifurcations, and 150% higher at coronary artery bifurcations than in unbranched aortic intima. Pretreatment with metoprolol in a dose resulting in \"therapeutic\" plasma levels significantly reduced platelet accumulation by 48% in unbranched aorta, 65% at intercostal, and 53% at coronary artery bifurcations.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Three groups of piglets were studied. Three control animals underwent cardiopulmonary bypass at normothermia for 1 hour; five group 1 animals underwent bypass at a brain temperature of 15 degrees C, followed by a period of circulatory arrest such that adenosine triphosphate was absent for 21 minutes, followed by 1 hour of reperfusion; and five group 2 animals underwent bypass at a brain temperature of 37 degrees C, followed by a period of circulatory arrest such that adenosine triphosphate was absent for 21 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 1 hour. Control animals showed no significant metabolic effects of bypass. Group 1 animals showed a slower decay of the adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine concentrations than group 2 animals, consistent with a lower metabolic rate, and had a higher pH at the onset of ischemia. Recovery of the adenosine triphosphate concentration was significantly better in group 1 animals (95%) than in group 2 animals (30%) (p less than 0.02), and recovery of the phosphocreatine concentration was also better in group 1 animals (93%) than in group 2 animals (32%) (p less than 0.02). Intracellular pH recovered in group 1 animals, but not in group 2 animals. Regional biochemical assays of metabolites performed in the group 2 piglets and in five pilot piglets exposed to deep hypothermia generally confirmed the spectroscopic findings but demonstrated considerable regional variation, specially in the group 2 piglets' brains. We conclude that hypothermia exerts a protective effect on the piglet brain during global ischemia even after the adenosine triphosphate pool has been completely depleted. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The meningeal branch of the spinal nerve (the sinuvertebral nerve) enters the vertebral canal and divides into ascending and descending branches which fuse with those from adjacent vertebrae. They give off transverse branches, connecting with those from the opposite side to form the superficial nerve fibre network in the intervertebral segment, which spreads to the vertebral segment of the PLL. Apart from this superficial nervous network, many nerve fibres enter through the posterolateral portion of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and form a dense, fine nerve fibre network in the deep layer of the intervertebral portion of the PLL and the superficial layer of the AF. Nerve fibres and terminals cannot be found in the deep layer of the AF or the nucleus pulposus. In the central part of the deeper nerve network there are few nerve terminals whereas there are abundant free nerve endings in the peripheral zones. It is suggested that these abundant nerve fibres may be correlated with various functions characteristic of this region and that they may be important in the regulation of movement and posture in the vertebral column. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The immunogenic potential of the monolayers--hence their capacity to be grafted--has also been analyzed. Fetuses ranging from 50 to 90 days were used, and, following digestion with collagenase (4 mg/ml, 15-20 min), the pancreatic suspension was plated onto tissue culture vessels containing RPMI 1640. The fetal calf serum concentration was kept low (5%) initially to inhibit fibroblast proliferation, but subsequently increased to 7%. Monolayers from a typical litter of 8-10 fetal pigs produced 6-8 x 10(8) viable epithelial cells by day 10 of culture, of which 75% were endocrine cells. This represents an 8-fold increase in a two-week period. The ratio of beta:alpha:delta:pancreatic polypeptide cells was 19:33:18:5. These monolayers synthesized both DNA, (pro)insulin and protein, and displayed increased insulin release when exposed to 10 mM theophylline, 10 mM Ca2+ and 1.3 microM 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. Static stimulation with 20 mM glucose however, did not elicit a response in insulin secretion. These cells displayed no reaction to allogeneic lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte culture, whereas freshly obtained porcine epithelial cells did. Methods may need to be found to increase the proportion of B cells in this enriched endocrine cell population. In general however, guidelines have been established that may be useful in developing a monolayer of human fetal pancreatic cells with the eventual aim of transplantation. The reduction in immunogenicity of the pig fetal pancreatic cells suggests that they too might be a potential source for transplantation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Recently, wheeze detection by tracheal auscultation with analog recording into a tape recorder has been utilized in young children in place of spirometry. Wheezing can also be identified using computerized lung sounds analysis (LSA) by a typical pattern on spectral analysis. Our aim was to develop a practical computerized system in which the response to histamine could be identified in an objective manner and documented on hard copy. Lung sounds were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard HP 21050A contact sensor placed over the right upper anterior chest. Sounds were amplified, band-filtered (50 to 2,000 Hz), and digitized at a sampling rate of 5.5 kHz into a Macintosh SE computer, and spectral LSA was performed. To validate our method, six older children (ages 9 to 16 years) with mild or moderate asthma underwent HCT. The identification of typical wheezing pattern (discrete, high-amplitude power peaks) on LSA was compared to 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PC20) and symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness). In five children, the histamine concentration required to produce the characteristic wheezing pattern on LSA was half that required to produce a 20 percent fall in FEV1. In the sixth patient, wheezing on LSA and PC20 occurred at the same histamine concentration. To determine the technique's applicability to young children, we then studied six young asthmatic children (age 2 to 5 years). All children showed the wheezing pattern at a histamine concentration of 25 percent or 50 percent (one or two steps prior) to that producing symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness) or wheezing on tracheal auscultation. Six age- and sex-matched nonasthmatic children (control subjects) did not show this pattern on LSA and had no symptoms or tracheal wheeze with HCT. We describe a sensitive method enabling application of HCT to young children who are unable to perform spirometry. This method is as sensitive as, and often more sensitive than, conventional PC20 with spirometry or tracheal auscultation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Using two methods, we have studied the potentiating effects of a series of heparin (poly)saccharides with high affinity for antithrombin and mean Mr ranging from approx. 1700 to 18,800. First, catalytic amounts of heparin (poly)saccharide were added to purified systems containing thrombin and either heparin cofactor II or antithrombin. Residual thrombin activity was determined with a chromogenic substrate. It was found that only the higher-Mr polysaccharides (Mr greater than 8000) efficiently catalysed thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II, there being a progressive catalytic effect with increasing Mr of the polysaccharide. Weak accelerating effects were noted with low-Mr saccharides (Mr less than 8000). This contrasted with the well-characterized interaction of heparin with antithrombin and thrombin, where heparin oligosaccharides of Mr less than 5400 had absolutely no ability to accelerate the reaction, while (poly)saccharides of Mr exceeding 5400 showed rapidly increasing catalytic activity with increasing Mr. Secondly, these and other heparin preparations were added in a wide concentration range to plasma with which 125I-labelled thrombin was then incubated for 30 s. Inhibited thrombin was determined from the distribution of labelled thrombin amongst inhibitor-thrombin complexes, predominantly antithrombin-thrombin and heparin cofactor II-thrombin complexes. In this situation, where the inhibitors competed for thrombin and for the (poly)saccharides, it was found that, provided the latter were of high affinity for antithrombin and exceeded a Mr of 5400, thrombin inhibition in plasma was mediated largely through antithrombin. Polysaccharides of Mr exceeding 8000 that were of low affinity for antithrombin accelerated thrombin inhibition in plasma through their interaction with heparin cofactor II. High concentrations of saccharides of Mr 1700-5400 exhibited a size-dependent acceleration of thrombin inhibition, not through their interaction with antithrombin, but through their interaction with heparin cofactor II. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis attending the immunology clinic of a tertiary care center were included in the study. Ninety consecutive patients were randomized to receive aspirin, naproxen, or placebo. Clinical evaluation was done every 2 wk. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, biopsies from the gastric antrum and duodenum for histological examination, and Helicobacter pylori studies were done at entry and after 2 months. The number of patients with dyspeptic symptoms was similar in the aspirin (12) and naproxen (9) groups. In both cases, however, it was higher (p less than 0.01) than in the placebo group (none). Naproxen was associated with a higher score of endoscopic abnormalities in the gastric body (0.6 +/- 1.3) than aspirin (0.2 +/- 0.6) or placebo (0.03 +/- 0.18). H. pylori was present in a similar proportion of patients in the three groups (33-43%). A greater fall in hemoglobin was observed with aspirin (0.35 +/- 0.48 g%) and naproxen (0.44 +/- 0.53 g%) than with placebo (0.09 +/- 0.4 g%).

The concentrations of haemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) antigens measured by single radial diffusion (SRD) and rocket immunoelectrophoresis were similar for both the whole virus and split vaccines. Whole virus and split vaccines induced crossreactive (CR) antibody in 87% of vaccinees. Strain specific (SS) antibody to A/Hong Kong/1/68 of the homologous virus was induced less frequently than CR antibody. Higher anti-haemagglutinin antibody titres were detected in persons receiving the split virus vaccines than in those receiving the whole virus vaccines. No antibody to the type-specific matrix protein was detectable, but 33% of volunteers developed an antibody rise to type-specific nucleoprotein antigen. The specificity of the anti-haemagglutinin antibody response in human adults to natural infection with A/Port Chalmers/73 (H3N2) virus was similar to that induced by inactivated vaccines in that a high proportion of subjects developed CR anti-haemagglutinin antibody, which reacted with A/Hong Kong/68 virus and the homologous A/Port Chalmers/73 virus, and SS antibody for A/Hong Kong/68 virus but SS antibody for A/Port Chalmers/73 virus was infrequently stimulated by natural infection. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the present study TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 were examined for their neurotrophic actions on neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with ganglionic nnc in dissociated cultures. TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 each increased both neuronal survival and levels of the peptide neurotransmitter substance P (SP) expressed per neuron as well as per culture. TGF beta 1 was maximally effective at a concentration of 40 pM, whereas TGF beta 2 was about 10-fold less potent. Survival effects promoted by simultaneous treatment with both factors were not additive. TGF beta 1 also changed the morphology and distribution of DRG nnc which resulted in clustering of DRG neurons on top of the nnc. Cotreatment of the cultures with two different anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies eliminated the neurotrophic effects of TGF beta 1. However, treatment with TGF beta 1 did not alter NGF mRNA expression in the cultures nor did it change the amount of NGF in the medium. Further, TGF beta 1 greatly enhanced survival effects and SP stimulation promoted by exogenous NGF at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml. The neurotrophic effects of TGF beta 1 were significantly attenuated by decreasing the proportion of the ganglionic nnc, suggesting a role for these cells in mediating TGF beta 1 action on the neurons. It is hypothesized that the neurotrophic activity of TGF beta depended upon the presence of molecules immunologically related to NGF and that the effects of TGF beta were synergistic with NGF. These observations suggest that TGF beta may play a role in the differentiation and regeneration of DRG neurons in vivo. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The group included 19 girls and 42 boys, of which 27 were of age not exceeding one week (group I), 19 were between the first and the second week (group II), and 15 were between the second week and the third month of life (group III). The concentrations of the thyroid hormones were determined by radioimmunoassay. The values obtained have been compared with the local reference range obtained for the newborns of the Mazovia region. The values remaining outside the reference range were found in 47.5% of the newborns studied. The elevated values of TSH were observed mainly in group I newborns (12 from 27); among group II newborns there was only one with the elevated values, and none among the newborns of group III. thyroxine (T4) values were lowered in 14 among 27 newborns of group I, and in 2 among 19 newborns of group II; all T4 values were normal in group III. The percentage of the elevated values of triiodothyronine (T3) was higher in older newborns (group III). The elevated level of T3 accompanied by the lowered level of T4 with the normal or moderately elevated level of TSH is characteristic for the adaptation to the deficiency of iodine. There is preferential secretion of T3 aimed at maintaining euthyreosis. The elevated levels of T3 found in 30% of newborns with untreated goiter suggest an intrauterine deficit of iodine as a cause of the goiter appearance.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The criteria for diagnosing the hippocampus as epileptic were: (1) all seizures originated in that one hippocampus, (2) surgical removal of that hippocampus resulted in seizure relief, and (3) the surgically excised hippocampus was sclerotic. Analysis of firing pattern by cross-correlation showed that synchronized firing between neurons occurred only in the epileptic hippocampus. However, synchronized firing was not limited to only bursting neurons, as previously reported in some animal models of epilepsy, but was also observed among non-bursting neurons in the epileptic hippocampus. Furthermore, no significant difference in distribution of burst-discharge neurons was found between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampi. In response to single pulse stimulation, neurons in both 'normal' (contralateral hippocampus) and epileptic hippocampus showed a rapid increase of firing (excitation), cessation of firing (inhibition), or a sequence of both (initial excitation followed by inhibition). However, a significant difference was found in the duration of the inhibition between synchronously firing neurons and non-synchronously firing neurons: the inhibition evoked by a single stimulation in synchronously firing epileptic neurons was significantly longer (373.8 msec +/- 35.9 S.E.M., P less than 0.005) than that of non-synchronously firing neurons (83.9 msec +/- 8.9 S.E.M.). Moreover, prolonged inhibition in synchronously firing epileptic neurons could occur with little or no prior excitation, suggesting that this inhibition does not necessarily depend on an intrinsic Ca2+-dependent K+-mediated after-burst hyperpolarization but is rather likely to be synaptic. As this inhibition was longer when epileptic neurons fired in synchrony, it could be interpreted that principal neurons recruited more recurrent inhibitory circuits by firing synchronously. By taking into account the previously reported neurophysiological evidence in human in vitro epileptic tissue showing GABA-mediated inhibition and the neuroanatomical evidence in excised human epileptic hippocampus showing GAD-positive neurons and synapses, our data suggest that, in human chronic epileptic hippocampus, recurrent inhibition remains functional, and alterations in GABA-mediated inhibition may not represent the critical change responsible for seizure generation. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

After receiving placebo 419 men aged 30-59 years suffering from arterial hypertension (diastolic arterial pressure in the sitting position greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) were given antihypertensive drugs after randomization. The treatment was provided in accordance with a stepped scheme and was started from monotherapy with the beta-adrenoblockers nadolol or propranolol (PP), or with the indirect vasodilator prazosin (PS) or the diuretic. If monotherapy failed, the patients were administered combinations of the indicated drugs. The treatment lasted one year, with a monthly control being exercised. 356 patients completed the studies. Of these, 131 patients (36.8%) had received monotherapy toward the end of the year. During the entire year, monotherapy was provided to 48.9% of the patients who started treatment from nadolol and completed the studies, to 34.1% who started treatment from PP, to 35.5% who started treatment from PS, and only to 14.4% of the patients who started treatment from the diuretic. Comparison of the patients' group given the diuretic with all the remaining groups demonstrate the difference to be significant. By the end of the treatment with nadolol, PP and PS, the diastolic arterial pressure reduced 10-11%, whereas toward the end of monotherapy with the diuretic, it dropped 6%, with the difference being significant. In patients on monotherapy, the negative chronotropic effect of nadolol exceeded that in patients given PP. Nadolol is an effective long-acting beta-blocker.

Her serum triglycerides varied between 2 and 90 mmol/l and she had substantial amounts of apolipoprotein B-48 in fasting plasma. She had no detectable lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in post-heparin plasma (less than 0.2 percent of normal). Southern blot analysis suggested no major defect in her LPL gene and Northern blot analysis of adipose tissue RNA showed normal-sized LPL-mRNA. A 2-h [35S]methionine incorporation experiment with adipose tissue pieces in vitro showed that she produced normal-sized LPL and had LPL catalytic activity in the tissue. The amounts were, however, only 5-10% of control. No detectable LPL radioactivity or catalytic activity was released from patient tissue even in the presence of heparin in the incubations. Immunofluorescent staining of adipose tissue biopsies from the patient showed LPL immunoreactivity only in adipocytes and little or none within the capillaries. Treatment of immunoprecipitated labeled LPL with endoglycosidase H showed that the oligosaccharide chains on her enzyme were of the high-mannose type and not processed as in controls. Taken together the data suggest that the patient synthesizes a relatively normal LPL protein which is core-glycosylated and folded into active enzyme as in normal subjects, but is not effectively transported via the Golgi to the cell surface. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Computer input was performed by a nurse data manager (20 minutes per patient), and data retrieval required approximately 30 minutes of computer time. Between 1984 and 1989, 241 patients with primary colorectal cancer underwent operation. The average age was 67.9 years (range from 31 to 94 years). The authors compared 108 (44.8%) patients who were older than 70 years with 133 (55.2%) patients who were 70 years of age or younger. Rectal carcinoma was more common in the younger age group (41.3% v. 20.4%), but right-sided carcinoma was more common in the older age group (36.1% v. 19.6%, p less than 0.001). Bleeding was more frequent in the younger patients than in the older ones (51.9% v. 35.2%, p less than 0.01). There was no difference between the two groups in tumour staging, using the modified Dukes' classification. The overall mortality was 2.5% and morbidity was 39.4%, with no significant differences between the groups.

To obtain a selection for the interviews, a postal questionnaire, containing questions on functional status and care utilization, sent out to a random sample of the elderly people (55+) living at home (n = 2451), preceded the actual interviews. The oral interviews yielded the same information, plus an inventory of aspects of the mental status, the social network, the socio-economic status and the housing condition. Analysis was performed in three ways: bivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis and discriminant analysis. The bivariate analysis revealed that users of professional care were older, more often female and more often not married. Their social network was less extensive, as they received less informal care and lived alone more often. Besides they had more mental and financial problems. From the regression analysis it appeared that, in addition to the functional status, the amount of informal care and the household composition contributed to the utilization of professional home care. For the other characteristics inventoried, no independent association with the utilization of professional care could be established. With hindsight, it appeared that in this study long interviews hardly had additional value over postal questionnaires, in which the contribution of functional status and informal care to professional care was already discovered. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Isolated preparations from basilar artery of mongrel dogs denuded of endothelium were contracted by 5-HT in the presence of 6 microM cocaine. In the presence of either ketanserin or spiperone, concentration-effect curves for 5-5-HT became biphasic. The responses to low concentrations of 5-5-HT were resistant to blockade by either antagonist. The responses to high concentrations of 5-HT were antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone in a concentration-dependent and partially surmountable manner. The lack of complete surmountability was at least partially due to fade during the determination of the cumulative concentration-effect curves. The pKB values for the component of the 5-HT-induced contractions that was antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone were 9.4 and 10.2 (-log M), respectively. The findings are consistent with the assumption of an interaction of ketanserin and spiperone with 5-HT at 5-HT2 receptors. On the other hand, the response to low concentrations of 5-HT is not mediated through 5-HT2 receptors. This response is antagonized by phentolamine with an affinity approximately 10 times lower than its affinity to 5-HT2 receptors, but not by prazosin or benextramine. It is conceivable that the receptor that mediates the response to low concentrations of 5-HT belongs to the 5-HT1A-subpopulation as suggested recently. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have performed a preliminary study to address the safety and acute effects of intravenous carvedilol in 17 patients with chronic congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease. Acute hemodynamic changes were monitored by right heart catheterization and arterial cannulation. Ejection fraction was also monitored by radionuclide ventriculography. Significant reductions in heart rate (79 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 12 beats/min, p less than 0.001) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (137 +/- 20/72 +/- 8 to 119 +/- 19/66 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01), systemic vascular resistance (1766 +/- 367 to 1518 +/- 377 dynes/s/cm-5/m2, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (20 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) were observed. Ejection fraction increased significantly from 24 to 28% (p less than 0.001) but there was little change in cardiac index or stroke volume index. The peak changes occurred at 10 min and the effect on pulmonary wedge pressure was maintained up to 30 min. No adverse effects were noted. The improvements in left ventricular filling pressure and systolic function, and the reduction in sympathetic activity may combine to produce an important therapeutic advantage in congestive heart failure. Further studies with this interesting agent are recommended. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Most anesthetics used to immobilize the animals tend to suppress the micturition reflex. An alternative means is decerebration. However, a decerebrate animal is not easily prepared. Instead of anesthesia or decerebration, we applied animal hypnosis to rabbits for immobilization. The urodynamic characteristics during animal hypnosis were compared with those under anesthesia. Twenty male rabbits weighting 2.5 to 3.0 kg were used. Animal hypnosis was produced by placing the rabbit on its back and restraining it in a V-shape trough and maintaining it there until it relaxed. Under hypnosis, cystometry was performed by the suprapubic route. The external sphincter EMG was recorded simultaneously with bladder pressure using a needle electrode. The urethral pressure profile was also measured during hypnosis. These measurements were repeated under anesthesia induced by intravenous pentobarbital injection (30 mg/kg). Furthermore, the hypnotic degree was assessed from respiratory rate and pupil size during these urodynamic measurements. In the rabbit, hypnosis began within 1 min and lasted for 30 to 60 min. During hypnosis, insertion of a catheter, pricking with a needle electrode and suprapubic puncture did not interrupt the immobility. Urodynamic study under animal hypnosis showed that, as bladder volume increased, the sphincter EMG activity increased and that the EMG activity ceased with bladder contraction. Bladder contraction coincided with the expulsion of saline from the urethral meatus. The maximal bladder pressure during micturition was 23.5 +/- 8.0 mmHg. The maximal bladder capacity at which the micturition reflex occurred was 41.4 +/- 22.3 ml.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Blockage of fiber formation within the first few days in vitro and inhibition of cell migrations by carbohydrate-specific antibodies served as an assay system for possible contributions of surface carbohydrates to the behavior of developing cerebellar cells. Microbial strains were selected on the basis of carbohydrate structures of their cell wall antigens, and anticarbohydrate antibodies were raised against treated whole bacteria and yeast in rabbits. We found that antibodies to mannan were active at all stages of development tested (embryonic day 13, E13; the day of birth, PO; and postnatal day 7, P7). Antibodies to sialic acids prepared against strains B and C of Neisseria meningitidis distinguish different subterminal structures: anti-B reacted with E13 and PO cerebellar cells, and anti-C mostly with cells older than P7. Antifetuin antibody recognized E13 and PO but not P7 cell populations. Pneumococcus C strain R36A-specific antibodies were effective only after coating cells to C type carbohydrate before application of the antibody. The results demonstrate that antimicrobiol carbohydrate antibodies cross-react with mammalian cell surface carbohydrate structures and therefore can be used as a powerful tool in tissue culture to analyse those structures which might control cell behaviors pertinent to cerebellar development. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

RNase H activity (RNase H I) associated with RNA-directed DNA polymerase eluted at 0.23 M KCI from poly(C)-agarose. RNase H II, which eluted from poly(C)-agarose at 0.12 M KCI and was not associated with DNA polymerase activity, was shown to be identical to an RNase H species (designated RNase H II) previously isolated from M-MSV(MLV) by a different procedure (G. F. Gerard and D. P. Grandgenett, J. Virol. 15:785-797, 1975). M-MSV(MLV) RNase H II was established to be a random exohybridase that requires free-chain termini in its hybrid substrate for activity. Lysates of Rickard feline leukemia virus also contained RNase H activity not associated with DNA polymerase activity that eluted from poly(C)-agarose at 0.12 M KCl. A third species of enzyme from M-MSV(MLV) lysates, called RNase H III, did not bind to poly(C)-agarose in 0.06 M KCl. RNase H III was purified from lysates of M-MSV(MLV) and M-MLV (grown in mouse cells) by sequential chromatography on poly(C)-agarose, DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and polyuridylic acid-Sepharose. Purified RNase H III (i) was free of any associated DNA polymerase activity, (ii) had an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 determined by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, (iii) had an absolute requirement for Mn2+ (1 mM optimum) for the degradation of [3H](A)n.(dT)n, (iv) was inhibited by the presence of any salt in reaction mixtures, and (v) was endoribonucleolytic in its mode of action as indicated by the size distribution of limited degradation products of [3H](A)n.(dT)n. RNase H III was inhibited by antisera prepared against Rauscher MLV and simian sarcoma virus reverse transcriptase, and the quantity of RNase H III and RNase H I present in lysates of M-MLV were reduced and increased proportionately if virus was lysed in the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These results indicate that RNase H III is a proteolytic cleavage product of DNA polymerase-RNase H. Substantial RNase H activity that did not bind to poly(C)-agarose in 0.06 M KCl was also found in lysates of Harvey MSV(MLV), Rauscher MLV, and Rickard feline leukemia virus, but not in lysates of avian myeloblastosis virus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

S-Carbonic anhydrase III (S-CA III) was used as a marker of protein leakage from type I (slow oxidative) muscle fibres and S-myoglobin (S-Mb) as a non-selective (type I + II) muscular marker. The fractional increase in S-CA III (delta S-Ca III) was 0.37 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001), 0.10 +/- 0.05 (N. S.) and 0.46 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.001) 1 h after exhaustive, anaerobic and aerobic exercise, respectively. The corresponding values for delta S-Mb were 1.45 +/- 0.36 (p less than 0.001), 0.39 +/- 0.13 (p less than 0.01) and 0.67 +/- 0.18 (p less than 0.001). The value for the delta S-CA III/delta S-Mb ratio was 0.68 +/- 0.03 after the aerobic exercise, but only 0.25-0.26 (p vs. aerobic exercise less than 0.001) after the two high-intensity forms of exercise. Since type I fibres of skeletal muscle are known to be responsible for power production during low-intensity exercise, whereas fibres of both type I and type II are active at higher intensities, the delta S-CA III/delta S-Mb ratio may depend on the recruitment profile of type I vs. type I + II fibres. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The biotin carboxylase gene encodes a protein of 449 residues that is strikingly similar to amino-terminal segments of two biotin-dependent carboxylase proteins, yeast pyruvate carboxylase and the alpha-subunit of rat propionyl-CoA carboxylase. The deduced biotin carboxylase sequence contains a consensus ATP binding site and a cysteine-containing sequence preserved in all sequenced bicarbonate-dependent biotin carboxylases that may play a key catalytic role. The gene encoding the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is located upstream of the biotin carboxylase gene and the two genes are cotranscribed. As previously reported by others, the BCCP sequence encoded a protein of 16,688 molecular mass. However, this value is much smaller than that (22,500 daltons) obtained by analysis of the protein. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified BCCP protein confirmed the deduced amino acid sequence indicating that BCCP is a protein of atypical physical properties. Northern and primer extension analyses demonstrate that BCCP and biotin carboxylase are transcribed as a single mRNA species that contains an unusually long untranslated leader preceding the BCCP gene. We have also determined the mutational alteration in a previously isolated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (fabE) mutant and show the lesion maps within the BCCP gene and results in a BCCP species defective in acceptance of biotin. Translational fusions of the carboxyl-terminal 110 or 84 (but not 76) amino acids of BCCP to beta-galactosidase resulted in biotinated beta-galactosidase molecules and production of one such fusion was shown to result in derepression of the biotin biosynthetic operon. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Local anesthetics, which are routinely administered before minor skin surgery and for postoperative pain relief, have been shown to have diverse effects on wound healing. Local anesthetics have also been reported to induce potent inhibition of leukocytes in vitro, although their effects on leukocyte activity in the surgical wound have not been elucidated. The present study investigated the in vivo effects of lidocaine on leukocyte function in the surgical wound of rats by sampling leukocytes from hollow titanium implants. The surgical wound was treated with lidocaine or placebo after implantation of the titanium chamber and before skin closure. Leukocyte metabolic activity was measured by chemiluminescence. Cell count was analyzed in a BÃ¼rker chamber. Results showed progressive increase in leukocyte counts in the wounds of control animals and significantly lower cell counts in the wounds of lidocaine-treated animals 48 h (P less than 0.05) and 72 h (P less than 0.05) after surgery. A pronounced inhibition of the metabolic response to serum-opsonized zymosan was seen after 8 h in the lidocaine-treated animals versus controls (P less than 0.05). After 24 h, leukocyte metabolic activity decreased dramatically in the control group and remained at a low level until 72 h after surgery. In the lidocaine-treated group, the leukocyte response to zymosan remained constantly low throughout the study. The effects of lidocaine were not a result of impaired leukocyte viability.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In order to examine the heterogeneity of DNA polymerases in murine leukemia L1210 cells and to characterize their general properties, we have attempted to separate the DNA polymerase activities from L1210 cells. By diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography (0.2 M-1M KCl) of the whole cell extract from L1210 solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), 4 fractions with DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities were obtained and designated as DD-1, DD-2, DD-3, and DD-4 for eluents with each corresponding concentration of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M KCl, respectively. They were distinguishable in properties such as template preference, divalent cation requirement, DNase sensitivity, isoelectric point (pI) and the behavior on the phosphocellulose chromatography. DD-1 preferred native DNA as template exhibiting similar characteristic as nuclear polymerase with low molecular weight and insensitivity to SH-inhibitors. DD-2, DD-3, and DD-4 utilized activated DNA most efficiently, while activity of DD-3 increased even in the presence of DNase 1 under the condition where the others were completely inhibited. Distribution of DNA polymerase activities in the cells is discussed briefly. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

CTX and melittin were approximately equipotent in the various biological activities, while prymnesin was not. 2. The rate of direct ehmolysis induced by CTX was slow, while that induced by either melittin or prymnesin was fast. 3. Phosphate ions, 10mM Ca++, as well as 1 mM reduced glutathione, considerably inhibited the CTX-induced hemolysis, but only slightly inhibited that induced by melittin or prymnesin. 4. CTX, melittin and prymnesin caused contracture of the chicken biventer cervicis muscle. Prymnesin was much less active in this preparation as compared with its hemolytic potency. The CTX contracture was completely inhibited by high Ca++ (10mM) medium, while the melittin contracture was not. 5. The rate of CTX contracture to reach the peak tension was increased when the concentration of CTX was increased, while the rate of melittin contracture did not change very much as the concentrations varied. 6. All three toxins caused a local irritation of the conjunctival sac of the rabbit eye. 7. Both CTX and melittin inhibited acetylcholinesterase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities, and also increased the turbidity of the rat liver mitochondrial suspension, while prymnesin was totally inactive in these respects.

In the distal radial diaphyses of 14 dogs, bilateral 7.5 X 20 mm cortical windows were created and fitted with 5 X 7.5 X 20 mm blocks of IP200 implants and iliac autografts. Both implanted and contralateral grafted radius specimens were retrieved at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months. Unstained undecalcified sections were examined by microradiography and UV epi-illumination. Stained undecalcified sections were examined by light microscopy and quantitated by histometric methods. Implant specimens demonstrated good union and bone ingrowth at all time intervals. The implant specimens were composed of (mean +/- SE) 10.6% +/- 1.0% soft tissue, 51.2% +/- 1.3% bone, and 38.2% +/- 1.0% IP200. The graft specimens showed good union with little apparent ingrowth at 3 months, followed by progressive appositional closure of cancellous spaces. The graft specimens contained 21.9% +/- 0.9% bone at 3 months with increases at each time interval to 73.1% +/- 8.7% at 48 months. The volume fraction and mean width of IP200 did not change with time, confirming the absence of implant biodegradation. The volume fraction and mean width of bone remained stable in the implant but increased in the graft specimens, corresponding to graft neocortex formation. It is concluded that implants initially filled in with bone while grafts initially replaced much of their spongiosa and subsequently filled in with bone. Histometry of untreated defects and measurement of mechanical properties are suggested for further study. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The vertebral body was replaced by acrylic cement sustained by a vertebral U shaped plate screwed to the adjacent vertebral bodies: this corporectomy was completed in 17 cases by a posterior approach. In 9 cases it allowed to treat a posterior epiduritis. The spinal metastases were symptomatic in 45 cases (pain and/or neurologic deficit); 22 of the operated patients were bed-ridden, either due to an important pain (16), or due to a severe neurological deficit (6). In 36 cases, the intervention was done on the spinal lord segment (7 times on the upper thoracic column). The patients were authorized to get up the fifth or sixth postoperative day. The functional results, at a price of 15 per cent of mortality during the first two postoperative months, were satisfactory and stable in time (particularly, 70 per cent of the operated patients with neurologic deficits were improved and 13 of the 21 bed-ridden became autonomous). The intracanalar decompressions controlled by a postoperative myelography, were nearly always total. The sets were stables in time when the block of cement was sustained by a metallic device. The mortality and the functional failure with pain and neurological impairment occurred essentially, when there was spreading of the tumor to the peri-vertebral soft tissues and when there was epiduritis extending beyond the bone lesion. Thus, to be perfectly efficacious, the anterior surgery of the vertebral metastasis, which gives durable and better results than the posterior one, should be soon enough integrated, in the global treatment of the metastatic disease. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

A pronase extraction-latex particle agglutination method (Streptex; Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, England) was used to rapidly detect GBS species-specific antigen directly from vaginal specimens. It was compared with quantitative and broth enrichment cultures. A total of 434 vaginal swab specimens were obtained before delivery. GBS cultures were positive for 14.7% of the specimens (64 of 434). Colony counts ranged from 2 to greater than 10(6) CFU per swab. The sensitivities of the direct antigen analysis were 19% (12 of 64) for all cultures and 63% (12 of 19) for specimens heavily colonized with GBS (greater than 10(4) CFU per swab). The specificity of the antigen test was 99.7%, with only one false-positive. There were three false-negative tests with colony counts of greater than 10(6) CFU per swab. The predictive values were 92% for a positive antigen test and 88% for a negative antigen test. The direct immunochemical detection of GBS antigen can be useful in a population of heavily colonized women. Direct latex particle agglutination does not appear to be salutary for a lightly colonized population and does not appear to be able to replace either culture or antigen detection after growth amplification at this time. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Despite intensive investigation, the mechanism of the third step, conversion of the 19-aldehydes into oestrogens, has remained unsolved. We have previously found that a pre-enolized 19-al derivative undergoes smooth aromatization in non-enzymic model studies, but the role of enolization by the enzyme in transformations of 19-oxoandrogens has not been previously investigated. The compounds 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]testosterone and 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]androstenedione have now been synthesized. Exposure of either of these compounds to microsomal aromatase, in the absence of NADPH, for an extended period led to no significant 2H loss or epimerization at C-2, leaving open the importance of an active-site base. However, in the presence of NADPH there was an unexpected substrate-dependent difference in the stereoselectivity of H loss at C-2 in the enzyme-induced aromatization of 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]-testosterone versus 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]androstenedione. The aromatization results for 17 beta-ol derivative 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]-testosterone correspond to about 1.2:1 2 beta-H/2 alpha-H loss from unlabelled 19-oxotestosterone. In contrast, aromatization results for 19-oxo[2 beta-2H]androstenedione correspond to at least 11:1 2 beta-H/2 alpha-H loss from unlabelled 19-oxoandrostenedione. This substrate-dependent stereoselectivity implies a direct role for an enzyme active-site base in 2-H removal. Furthermore, these results argue against the proposal that 2 beta-hydroxylation is the obligatory third step in aromatase action. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Stimulation of cyclic AMP production by 1-isoproterenol is maximum from 0.1 to 1.0 microM; at higher concentrations stimulation decreases and approaches basal levels. Decreased cyclic AMP production at high concentrations of isoproterenol is blocked by the specific alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin. Ciliary processes from animals after bilateral cervical ganglionectomy also show reduced cyclic AMP production at high concentrations of isoproterenol and this reduction is blocked by yohimbine, but not prazosin. This experiment suggests that the inhibition at high concentrations of isoproterenol is mediated by postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Cyclic AMP production is relatively insensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine, but their responses are potentiated by yohimbine. Catecholamines and clonidine, a specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by ciliary processes. I50s from the dose-response curves are consistent with the characteristic binding affinities of these adrenergic agonists for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors: clonidine = epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoproterenol. Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by clonidine is blocked by yohimbine but not by prazosin.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Using Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) in a long-term prednisone-treated sarcoid population we have shown in 1988 [1] that Bone Mineral Loss is more frequent than elsewhere reported with other techniques on patients with different diseases. It was not clear if this difference was due to the sarcoidosis itself or to the better sensitivity of QCT compared to former techniques [2]. Thus we have now studied QCT in a group of 36 untreated patients with active, histologically proven sarcoidosis, chronic in most cases, to clarify the action of sarcoidosis itself over the BMC. For each patient Vertebral Cancellous Mineral Content (VCMC) has been expressed in terms of Z score (i.e. the number of Standard Deviations (SD) above or below the normal value) in order to overcome the differences due to age and sex. In the whole group, mean value of Z score was -0.41 +/- 0.30 (P > 0.05 vs. 190 normals). Nevertheless VCMC was below the normal range in 13 out of 36 patients; in five of them, all with longstanding sarcoidosis for at least 2 years, VCMC was more than two SD below the normal; four out of 36 had a VCMC lower than 110 mg/cm3 K2HPO4 eq, that is considered the threshold level under which the risk of fracture begins (but three of them were postmenopausal females).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The weights of the thymus and spleen were lower at all stages of dystrophy. Total nucleotide and RNA levels per thymus were reduced at 90 days, while total DNA content was decreased at 60 and 90 days. Protein concentrations per thymus were diminished at each stage of the disease. The specific activity of the free amino acid pool and total free nucleotide pool did not show any significant variations in the thymus at any phase of dystrophy. Incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein and of [3H]orotate into RNA was considerably lower in the thymus at each stage of the disease. Total nucleotide content per spleen was decreased at 40 days, with no change at 60 days and followed by an increase at 90 days in the dystrophic mice. DNA, RNA, and protein levels were all reduced in the spleen at each stage of the disease. The specific activity of the free amino acid pool and total free nucleotide pool, as well as the incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein and of [3H]orotate into RNA, showed similar changes in the spleen as noted in the thymus at each phase of dystrophy. These observations indicate that significant alterations in cellular growth occur not only in skeletal muscle and other nonlymphoid organs, but also in the lymphoid organs of dystrophic mice.

In sensitized normoxic hearts, both antigen (0.8 mg) and PAF (100 pmol) induced a short-term increase followed by a long-term decrease in coronary flow (CF). The antigen- but not the PAF-evoked increase in CF was accompanied by a substantial release of histamine. WEB-2086 enhanced the vasodilator effect and abolished the vasoconstrictor effect of 100 pmol of PAF but neither modified the coronary vascular effects of antigen nor the antigen-induced histamine release. Ischemia for 60 min followed by 30 min of reperfusion increased the diastolic left ventricular pressure but a 30-min period of ischemia and reperfusion had no effect on baseline cardiac function. WEB-2086 had no effect on ischemia-induced changes in cardiac function. A 30-min period of global ischemia enhanced the antigen-induced decrease in CF and systolic left ventricular pressure (SLVP). A 60 min period, however, suppressed the antigen-induced effects on CF and SLVP as well as antigen-induced histamine release. WEB-2086 partly protected the heart against the enhanced antigen-induced decrease in CF and SLVP after a 30-min period of global ischemia but no modulatory role of WEB-2086 was observed after 60 min of global ischemia. Our conclusions are that (a) PAF is not involved in rat cardiac anaphylaxis since WEB-2086 was proven to be inactive; (b) cardiac ischemia and cardiac anaphylaxis have interrelated mechanism of action since ischemia changed the anaphylactic response, which indicates that coincidence of these two pathological events could influence the clinical outcome; and (c) PAF is possibly involved in rat cardiac ischemia since WEB-2086 partly protected the heart against the enhanced antigen-induced decrease in CF and SLVP after 30 min of ischemia and reperfusion. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

During endoscopic placement of percutaneous gastrostomy tubes (PEG), the gastroscope is inserted twice and the stomach is markedly distended, thus increasing the potential risk of complications. Also, the procedure is frequently performed in patients exhibiting underlying systemic disease or little respiratory reserve. Patients undergoing PEG or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) were studied prospectively. Blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry, and lead II ECG tracings were obtained. Measurements were made before sedation, after sedation, at gastroscope insertion, at gastrostomy placement, at gastroscope reinsertion, and at 5 min after the procedure. In all, 50 patients (mean age, 56.8 years; 16 women, 26 men) underwent PEG only (39 cases) or PEG/PEJ (11 cases). The endoscopy suite was the site for the procedure in 38 cases and the intensive care unit was used in 12 cases. The mean time required for PEG and PEG/PEJ was 14.7 +/- 1.1 and 18.9 +/- 2 min, respectively. Blood pressure remained stable throughout the procedure. Sinus tachycardia was observed in 72% of patients. Arterial oxygen saturation decreased after the administration of intravenous sedation but remained constant during the procedure. We reached the following conclusions: (1) desaturation occurs during sedation, (2) saturation remains constant during PEG/PEJ, (3) the mean blood pressure remains constant during PEG/PEJ, and (4) PEG/PEJ are safe procedures and monitoring should be individualized. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Responsiveness of pial arterioles to ACh, methacholine, and nicotine was studied using a closed cranial window. Pial arteriolar diameter was measured using intravital microscopy. Pial arteriolar responses to ACh, 10(-8)-10(-4)M, applied to the cortical surface, were variable and dose-dependent. At low concentration, 10(-7)M, 45% of the arterioles increased diameter by 9 +/- 1%, 19% responded by decreasing diameter by 9 +/- 1%, and 35% did not respond. The response to high concentration, 10(-4)M, was a profound decrease in diameter, 28 +/- 3%, in 78% of the arterioles studied. These effects were abolished by atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). Muscarinic agonist, methacholine, 10(-5)-10(-3)M, also resulted in a decrease in cerebral vascular diameter, while nicotine, 10(-6)-10(-4)M, had no effect. In six animals, administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.), blocked the response to 10(-4)M ACh but did not affect the response to 10(-7)M ACh. In five animals, administration of lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (2 mg/kg i.v.) augmented the vasoconstrictor response at both ACh concentrations. The data suggest that, in the newborn piglet, vasoactive prostanoids released following cholinergic activation of a muscarinic-type receptor mediate vasoconstriction in cerebral arterioles. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

We have examined the effect of human wound fluid on the in vitro growth of human dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Acute wound fluid was collected from six patients undergoing split-thickness skin grafting. The acute wound fluid was sterilely collected daily from underneath a vapor-permeable membrane applied to the donor site and changed every 24 hours for 3 days postoperatively. After seeding in optimal growth media (control) on day 0, cultures of human dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells were supplemented with or without acute wound fluid on the next day (day 1) and on day 3. As determined by cell counts, 2% acute wound fluid stimulated the growth of human dermal fibroblasts (p less than 0.05) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (p less than 0.01) when these cells were cultured in 2% fetal bovine serum and endothelial growth medium, respectively. Wound fluid from postoperative days 1 or 3 caused the same level of stimulation. The addition of an anti-platelet-derived growth factor antibody to wound fluid resulted in a 45% mean reduction in its stimulatory effect on fibroblast growth (p less than 0.02), suggesting that platelet-derived growth factor contributes to the observed effect.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

High molecular weight DNA (greater than 50 kb) was extracted from log phase CV-1 cells and 6 micrograms incubated with approximately 2.5 micrograms of a monoclonal antibody, 2D3, specific for cruciform-containing DNA. The 2D3-bound DNA was digested with EcoRI and antibody-bound fragments were recovered using rabbit anti-mouse immunobeads. The beads were washed free of nonspecifically bound DNA and the 2D3-bound DNA was eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The yield of DNA recovered by 2D3 was 2000-fold less than the initial amount and was 17-20-fold more than that recovered nonspecifically using the control mAb, P3. The 2D3-bound DNA ranged from 0.15- greater than 23 kb with a major peak at approximately 12 kb. Specific enrichment of origin-containing DNA by 2D3 over P3 was suggested by a 10-100-fold greater recovery of a 9 kb fragment hybridizable to a low-copy monkey autonomously replicating sequence, ors 8. 20 ng of affinity-purified DNA was cloned into lambda Zap II and excised into Bluescript phagemids in vivo. Of nine randomly-selected clones between 0.15 and 3.2 kb, four were able to replicate autonomously when transfected into HeLa cells. Two of the nine clones contained sequences hybridizable to both monkey alpha-satellite and human Alu DNA, and two others to Alu alone.

A platform runway, designed to examine the locomotion of this species of animals, was used. Eighteen Hartley-strain albino guinea pigs were used. These animals were divided into three groups, with seven in the control group, six whose right eye had been surgically closed in another group, and five whose left eye had been surgically closed in yet another group. After 7 to 11 days of training, a chemical labyrinthectomy by chloroform injection into the middle ear was performed under light ether anesthesia. Animals were checked for locomotion daily by the aforementioned platform method for about a week until regaining preprocedure levels. The locomotor compensation, depicted through the decrement of the deviation count and running time, was observed. Results have shown that the animal's locomotor compensation retarded significantly in the one-eye groups compared to the control group. In addition, those animals whose one eye, ipsilateral to the labyrinthectomy side, was closed required significantly longer time to resume the preprocedure running performance level than the animals whose one eye, contralateral to the lesion side, was closed. Thus, during locomotor compensation, the visual input obtained by animals with one eye ipsilateral to the labyrinthectomy side may be important compared to the visual input of the animals with the contralateral eye. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

Isoelectric point variants of corneal ALDH (designated ALDH3) and a major soluble protein in corneal extracts were observed among eight families of animals used in studying the genetics of these proteins. Both phenotypes exhibited identical patterns following PAGE-IEF and were inherited in a normal Mendelian fashion, with two alleles at a single locus (ALDH3) showing codominant expression. The data provided evidence for genetic identity of corneal ALDH with this major soluble protein, and supported biochemical evidence, recently reported for purified bovine corneal ALDH, that this enzyme constitutes a major portion of soluble corneal protein (Abedinia et al. 1990). Isoelectric point variants for corneal ADH were also observed, with patterns for the two major forms (ADH3 and ADH4) and one minor form (ADH5) being consistent with the presence of two ADH subunits (designated gamma and delta), and variant phenotypes existing for the gamma subunit. The genetics of this enzyme was studied in the eight families, and the results were consistent with codominant expression of two alleles at a single locus (designated ADH3). It is relevant that a major detoxification function has been proposed for corneal ADH and ALDH, in the oxidoreduction of peroxidic aldehydes induced by available oxygen and UV-B light (Holmes & VandeBerg, 1986a). In addition, a direct role for corneal ALDH as a UV-B photoreceptor in this anterior eye tissue has also been proposed (Abedinia et al. 1990). \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The results presented in this paper indicate that (1) a potassium conductance mediates the hyperpolarizing phase of the BPP; (2) the BPP amplitude is directly dependent on [Na+]0; (3) BPP activity requires the presence of divalent cations and is prevented by C02+ and La3+, but not D-600; (4) the apparent increase in membrane resistance during the depolarizing phase of the Bd can be accounted for by the movement of the membrane potential along the non-linear portion of the I-V curve; and (5) non-linear I-V relations and a minimal effective membrane resistance are pre-requisite to BPP generation. Coupled with recent observations on the presence of an inward current in these cells, the results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the BPP are similar to those proposed to describe the myocardial pacemaker potential: the hyperpolarizing phase is due to activation of a potassium conductance which slowly inactivates, resulting in a gradula deplorization until a voltage-dependent inward current is activated which then leads to an increasingly rapid deplorization and initiation of the burst of spikes. It would appear that Na+ may play the major role in carrying the inward current, although a secondary role for divalent cations cannot be discounted. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The authors have sought to further define the role of intrapulmonary TNF in IgG alveolitis and to examine its role in IgA immune complex alveolitis, a neutrophil-independent model of acute lung injury. IgG immune complex lung injury resulted in a marked rise in intrapulmonary TNF activity accompanied by progressive pulmonary PMN accumulation. Intratracheal instillation of neutralizing concentrations of anti-TNF markedly reduced PMN influx measured at 4 hours but had no effect on PMN recruitment quantitated at 2 hours. IgA immune complex deposition resulted in acute lung injury accompanied by increased numbers of intrapulmonary mononuclear phagocytes but few neutrophils. Lung lavage fluids obtained from IgA immune complex-injured rats contained both neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activities, albeit at twofold to fourfold lower concentrations than observed in IgG-mediated alveolitis. In contrast to IgG complex-mediated alveolitis, lung lavage fluids from IgA-injured rats contained no TNF activity. Intratracheal administration of anti-TNF antibodies had no effect on the development of IgA lung injury as assessed by morphology and measurements of vascular permeability. In vitro exposure of isolated alveolar macrophages to performed IgG immune complexes resulted in dose-dependent TNF secretion, while exposure to IgA complexes resulted in very low levels of TNF secretion. These data suggest that TNF-mediated pulmonary neutrophil recruitment (in IgG lung injury) is manifest chiefly in the late phase (approximately 4 hours) of developing alveolitis. The virtual absence of intrapulmonary TNF activity in evolving IgA immune complex alveolitis may in part account for the limited PMN recruitment observed in this model. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Rapid, sensitive, and specific measurement of serum CDT levels can thus provide important clinical information concerning patient diagnosis and treatment. To date, however, methods used for assessing CDT concentrations [e.g., analytical isoelectric focusing combined with immunofixation and micro anion-exchange chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay (RIA)] have not been practical enough for widespread laboratory application. In the present study, we examined the use of a different technique, namely isoelectric focusing (IEF) combined with Western blotting (IEF/WB). Serum proteins (20-40 micrograms) were first focused according to isoelectric points (pI) on high-resolution agarose IEF gels (ampholyte pH range of 5-8) containing nonionic detergent. The focused proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters, and then stained immunochemically with antihuman transferrin IgG. IEF/WB completely resolved CDT (focusing at pI 5.7 and 5.9) from other serum transferring isoforms, as assessed with neuraminidase-generated CDT standards. Computerized densitometric scanning of the immunoblots allowed CDT levels to be quantitated directly rather than as a quotient. Serum CDT content determined by IEF/WB was highly correlated (r2 = 0.962; n = 17) with values determined previously by RIA. In a larger subject group, CDT levels (mg/liter) measured by IEF/WB were 139 +/- 54 in recently-drinking alcoholics (n = 58), 81 +/- 8 in abstaining alcoholics (n = 7), and 68 +/- 16 in healthy control subjects (n = 16).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Rat lungs were perfused in situ with a physiological salt solution and were loaded with [3H]adenosine. The release of 3H from the perfused rat lung in response to intra-arterial injections of Ang II and other hormones was quantitated. Studies were conducted in both normal rats and in rats that had been nephrectomized before surgery to avoid exposure of the lungs to high levels of endogenous Ang II. Bolus doses of Ang II (10(-12)-10(-7) mol) increased the efflux of 3H from the lungs. Analysis of this effluent by thin-layer chromatography indicated that most of the Ang II-induced release of 3H was [3H]adenosine. The maximal response was usually obtained with 10(-9) mol, and higher doses (10(-8) and 10(-7) mol) mobilized less [3H]adenosine, which suggested tachyphylaxis. The effect of exogenous Ang II on [3H]adenosine release was greatly enhanced when activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system was prevented with prior nephrectomy. Infusion of the Ang II selective antagonist, (1-Sar-8-Ile)-Ang II, blocked Ang II-induced [3H]adenosine release. Neither norepinephrine, bradykinin, nor vasopressin consistently released adenosine. We conclude that (a) Ang II can induce the release of adenosine from the perfused rat lung, (b) this effect is receptor mediated, (c) this response is somewhat selective for Ang II, and (d) exposure to high levels of exogenous or endogenous Ang II causes tachyphylaxis so that Ang II-induced adenosine release is attenuated. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The mean age was 67.7 years (58-80 years). The Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning (DISF) was the evaluation used. The Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning measures five domains of sexual functioning: sexual fantasy, arousal, experience, orgasm, and drive. Twenty-seven of the 43 (62.7%) patients evaluated were considered impotent. Fifteen of the 27 patients scored low in all five domains of sexual functioning even though they could achieve erection but they were unable to maintain erection throughout the phases of the sexual response cycle. Twelve of the 27 patients had scored 0 on sexual arousal and orgasm, thus had no ability for erection. Sixteen of the 43 (37.2%) patients were considered potent. This group of patients had achieved erection throughout the phases of sexual cycle and scored adequately in all five domains of sexual functioning. Patients with DISF score less than 20 were impotent. Those with a Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning score of greater than 45 were potent. Only 6 of 19 patients with scores between 20 and 45 were potent. The Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning score was highly prognostic for impotence, (p = .002) was easy to use and could be used for follow-up of the effect of therapy on sexual function in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

Cells from eight human abortuses (18-22 weeks' gestation) showed accelerated plaque formation after treatment with 10(-7) mol/L GHRH-(1-44) [25.6 +/- 0.6% (+/- SE) of cells formed plaques (PFC); mean area, 14.5 +/- 2.7 X 10(4) micron2; all at 1 h], while 10(-7) mol/L SRIH-(1-28) slowed plaque formation (8.6 +/- 0.6% PFC; mean area, 4.2 +/- 0.8 X 10(4) micron2) vs. control (13.7 +/- 0.7% PFC; mean area, 5.3 +/- 0.8 X 10(4) micron2; all at 1 h). The proportion of PFC was equal in GHRH-treated and control groups by 4 h, suggesting that GHRH affects the amount of GH secreted per somatotroph rather than the number of cells that are preferentially responsive to GHRH. Qualitatively similar data were obtained using pituitary cells from four near-term rhesus fetuses. When cells were cultured in defined medium for 3 days, supplementation with T3 reduced basal GH secretion and attenuated the responses to GHRH. Culture with dexamethasone increased basal GH secretion and restored the responsiveness to GHRH. Dexamethasone also caused a shift in plaque area frequency distributions to patterns similar to those in serum-supplemented medium. We conclude that fetal somatotrophs are responsive to SRIH, GHRH, T3, and dexamethasone. Furthermore, glucocorticoids can maintain a subpopulation of fetal somatotrophs in the GHRH-responsive state. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The neuropathy tests were performed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and significant changes were recorded in five. These changes (in two pupillary and three cardiovascular tests) all indicated worsening function which exceeded that explicable by aging.

We studied permeability and luminal membrane glycoconjugates in these vessels using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lectin-ferritin (Fe) techniques. RCS and genetic control rats were injected with HRP, their retinas were fixed, incubated in Fe conjugates of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-Fe) or concanavalin-A (ConA-Fe), reacted to demonstrate HRP, and prepared for electron microscopy. The RPE and VRM vessels in RCS retinas were compared with the normal inner retina and choriocapillaris vessels in RCS and genetic control rats. In both groups inner retinal vessels formed a barrier to HRP, while fenestrated choriocapillaris (CE) vessels were permeable to the tracer. In both of these vascular beds plasma membrane WGA-Fe binding was dense and uniform, while ConA-Fe binding was sparse and patchy. Studies with competitive sugars showed that WGA-Fe binding was primarily to N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and that ConA-Fe was to mannose. In both RPE and VRM vessels tight junctions appeared intact, but both vessel types were permeable to HRP with the RPE vessels often containing fenestrae and channels. As compared with binding in the inner retina and CE vessels, WGA-Fe binding was lower in VRM vessels and normal in RPE vessels, while ConA-Fe binding was higher in both RPE and VRM vessels. Thus, increased permeability is accompanied by alterations in both NAG and mannose residues in the VRM vessels and with alterations in mannose residues and the presence of fenestrations and channels in the RPE vessels. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Sections of crypts of the small intestine were assayed for acute histological cell death at various times up to 12 h after treatment. Dead or dying cells exhibited the typical light microscopic morphological features of apoptosis. The incidence of apoptosis at each cell position along the side of longitudinal crypt sections was recorded and frequency plots of the incidence against cell position were determined. NEU (50 mg/kg) produced the highest incidence of cell death but this was closely followed by NDMA (50 mg/kg) and NMU (200 mg/kg). DMH (40 or 80 mg/kg) was the least cytotoxic but even here significantly elevated levels of cell death were observed. The highest incidence of cell death occurred 4-5 h after treatment with NEU, NMU and DMH and at 6 h after NDMA. The data obtained at 4 h after NEU suggest that approximately 22 cells out of a total crypt population of 250 cells are killed, but that for some cell positions near the crypt base (stem cell regions) up to 24% of the cells may be killed. Analysis of the changing shape of the frequency plots with time after treatment enabled the target cell position in the crypts for cytotoxicity to be estimated. This was at cell position 4 for NEU, NMU and DMH and at cell position 5 for NDMA. The stem cells in the crypts are believed to be located at the fourth cell position and hence at least NEU, NMU and DMH are targeting the stem cells with some specificity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In pre-B and pre-T lymphoma cells transformed by A-MuLV, the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein has an MW of 160 kDa and shares immunologically detectable sequences with the v-abl oncogene product. Moreover, two different proteins of approximately 100 and 68 kDa, heavily phosphorylated at tyrosine, were identified. Lack of immunological cross-reactivity with viral products and phosphopeptide mapping showed that the 100 and 68 kDa proteins are coded by cellular genes. Phosphoproteins were undetectable in control resting lymphocytes. The 68 and the 100 kDa proteins were phosphorylated to different extents in proliferating lymphocytes, either stimulated by the growth factor IL-2, or transformed by M-MuLV (lacking the oncogene coded kinase). In fibroblasts transformed by A-MuLV, phosphotyrosine antibodies identified 2 proteins of 120 and 70 kDa. By immunological cross-reaction and by phosphopeptide mapping, the first was identified as a 120 kDa form of the v-abl coded kinase. The 70 kDa protein is coded by a cellular gene, is not structurally related to the 120 kDa v-abl kinase, and is different from any phosphotyrosine-containing protein detected in A-MuLV-transformed lymphocytes. These data show that, upon v-abl-induced transformation, phosphorylation at tyrosine takes place also on proteins other than the 160 or 120-kDa oncogene products. In lymphocytes and fibroblasts these proteins are different, suggesting that the cascade of events triggered by the v-abl gene in different cell types involves tyrosine phosphorylation of different specific proteins. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The species of Leishmania used were L. tropica (Afganistanian strain) in blood and L. major (Egyptian strain) in blood, in volunteer patient and in hamster, L. major (Morocco strain) in Meriones shawi, L. infantum (French strain) in dog and L. enrietti (Brazilian strain) in Guinea-pig. The results showed that Egyptian P. papatasi was the most suitable species for Egyptian L. major in blood followed by P. dubosqui. On the other hand, P. dubosqui was the most suitable species for L. tropica in blood followed by Indian P. papatasi. On the other hand, Egyptian P. papatasi acquired L. major from hamster (38.2%) and L. enrietti from Guinea pig (1.9%), but not L. major from the patient. Indian P. papatasi acquired L. major from Meriones (5.6%), L. infantum from dog (1.09%) but not L. enrietti from Guinea pig. Generally speaking, L. major was more engalfed by P. papatasi (2 strains) from the artificial source (blood) than from the vertebrate hosts. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The commonest serotypes were Groups C, F, B and A. Using specific monosera for typing it was found that serotype 14 was the commonest followed by serotypes 3, 7, 1, 2, 19 and 8 respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin determined by an agar dilution method, showed that 81% were susceptible (MIC less than 0.1 mg/L), 18% were relatively resistant (MIC = 0.1-1 mg/L) and 1% showed increased resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/L). The use of a 1 microgram oxacillin disc distinguished between susceptible and relatively penicillin resistant pneumococci more reliably than did the use of a penicillin disc (1 or 10 micrograms). Resistance of S. pneumoniae to tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin were 70%, 43%, 12% and 4% respectively. All isolates were susceptible to oral cephalosporins (cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefuroxime axetil) with an MIC range of less than or equal to 0.03-2 mg/L. The selection of antimicrobial therapy and the efficiency of vaccines depend on the knowledge of the local isolates of S. pneumoniae. Clinical isolates should be routinely screened to detect susceptibility to penicillin. The relatively high incidence of resistance to multiple antibiotics indicates the need to perform antibiotic susceptibility testing in order to avoid possible therapeutic failure. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The coding strategy of the C virus RNA segments is the same as that for the large A and B virus segments as one long open reading frame is present in each segment. RNA segment 1 of influenza C virus encodes the equivalent of the PB2 protein; it has an approximate 25% sequence identity with the corresponding (cap binding) influenza A and B virus PB2 proteins. The PB1 protein of influenza C virus, coded for by segment 2, has an approximate 40% sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of influenza A and B viruses including the Asp-Asp sequence motif found in many RNA polymerase molecules. The PB1 polymerase is thus the most highly conserved protein among the influenza A, B, and C viruses. Although the protein coded for by RNA 3 of influenza C virus shows an approximate 25% sequence identity with the acid polymerase (PA) proteins of the A and B viruses, its sequence does not display any acid charge features at neutral pH. This protein is thus referred to as the P3 (rather than the PA) protein of influenza C virus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The 3 ventral roots (VRs) that innervate the hindlimb were transected, and the animals were killed 6-7 weeks later (reinnervation took place within 3 weeks). At early stages of development, axotomy resulted in an increase in the number of spinal motoneurons on the operated side. By histological criteria, these motoneurons appeared more differentiated than those in normal tadpoles. Axotomy was effective in increasing motoneuron number only during the period of naturally occurring cell death. Similar effects were seen when the transected VRs were ligated to prevent regeneration. Hindlimb amputation without VR transection had no effect on motoneuron number or differentiation. Thus, target removal is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for hyperplasia of the lateral motor column. An extreme loss of spinal motoneurons was seen if the operated tadpole entered into metamorphic climax during the 6-7-week postoperative survival period. Motoneuron loss occurred although the injured motoneurons had reconnected to the hindlimb. In contrast, tadpoles allowed to survive up to 6 months showed no loss of motoneurons if they did not enter metamorphic climax. From these data, it appears axon transection in developing spinal motoneurons exerts its effects on motoneuron number and differentiation by altering the metabolic state of the motoneuron (axon reaction) rather than by depriving it of contact with its target. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

These patients had disease resectable with curative intent and were followed for a minimum of 5 years or until death. Among 2,749 Stage I cases, 33 had recurrence and proved to be histologically stage I. A pair matching case control study between these 33 cases and matched 33 stage I controls without recurrence proved that the preoperative CEA level was relatively higher in cases with recurrence (p = 0.079). In Stage II and III cases, an analysis of variance using a cut off level as a block factor was performed. Among 315 Stage II cases, preoperative CEA levels were significantly higher in cases with recurrence than in cases without recurrence. In 468 Stage III cases, no correlations between preoperative CEA levels and high risks of cancer recurrence were detected. In Stage I and Stage II cases, CEA levels significantly increased at the time of recurrence. In conclusion, preoperative high serum CEA levels might be considered one of the risk factors for recurrence of Stage I and II gastric cancers, and monitoring the postoperative CEA levels might be useful in early detection of recurrence. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

To investigate the manner in which the gag-initiated polyproteins of the mouse mammary tumor virus are produced, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1.8-kilobase DNA fragment that spans the region between gag and pol in the C3H strain of mouse mammary tumor virus. The sequence reveals three overlapping open reading frames: the first encodes products of gag (p27gag and p14gag); the second encodes a protein domain of unknown function (termed X) that is highly related to a similarly positioned sequence in simian type D retroviruses and the viral protease (pro); and the third encodes the reverse transcriptase. The reading frames are organized to permit uninterrupted readthrough from gag to pol if ribosomal frameshifts occur in the -1 direction within each of the two overlapping regions, one of which is 16 nucleotides in length and the other 13 nucleotides. Cell-free translation of RNA containing these overlap regions shows that fusion of the reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting occurs efficiently: about one-fourth of the ribosomes traversing the gag-X/pro overlap and one-tenth traversing the X/pro-pol overlap shift frames, generating gag-related polyproteins in ratios similar to those observed in vivo. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing either of the overlap regions inserted into novel contexts do not induce frameshifting; hence the overlapping portions of the reading frames are not sufficient to induce a frameshift event, and a larger sequence context or secondary structure may be implicated. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

First, the maximal cross sectional area (MCA) of the forearm flexor muscles was estimated in each individual using magnetic resonance imaging. Then, during multistage forearm flexor exercise, 31P-MRS was performed to estimate phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic P (Pi), and intracellular pH. Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography. An initial work load of forearm exercise was decided by MCA as 1 J/cm2, and multistage exercise was done with an increment of 1 J/min/cm2 to the point of maximal muscle exhaustion. The maximal load (J/min) was decreased in cardiac groups as NYHA class advanced. However, the difference among all groups except group C3 was not significant when the max load was adjusted for muscle MCA. As the work load was increased during forearm exercise, PCr and intracellular pH decreased, and Pi increased in every group. Standardized PCr [PCr/(PCr + Pi)] was lower in group C2 and C3 than in group N at each work load. At high work loads, intracellular pH tended to be lower in group C2 and C3 than in group N and C1. Forearm blood flow during forearm exercise was not different among the four groups. In the maximal exercise test using upright ergometer, peak oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold were lower in group C1, C2 and C3 than in group N.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

After intravenous injection of A14-[125I]insulin into normals, eight labelled insulin derivatives were found in plasma (peaks 1-8). Two of them (peaks 1 and 7) showed an elution pattern identical with those of reference [125I]monoiodotyrosine and intact A14-[125I]insulin, respectively. Of the other six peaks, five (2-6) eluted before and one (peak 8) after insulin. This pattern was highly reproducible in terms of capacity factors and peak heights. Radioactivity separated by RP-HPLC was further characterized for its trichloroacetic acid precipitability and immunoprecipitability. Fractions corresponding to peaks 4-6 and 8, which showed an immunoprecipitability higher than 50%, were pooled in order to obtain sufficient radioactivity and were found to be insulin separated by Sephadex G-50 chromatography, containing in its structure, after sulphitolysis, intact A-chain and to be partially rebindable to monocyte insulin receptors. These data demonstrate that in blood, products of insulin metabolism circulate which retain a part of the immunological and biological properties of the hormone. These products are clearly separated from one another and from intact insulin by RP-HPLC, suggesting that the appropriate use of this technique may allow a further and more accurate qualitative and quantitative characterization of in vivo insulin metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Bidirectional calcium flux in the duodena and ilea of normal rats was assessed by means of dual calcium isotopes. Two micromolar aluminum significantly inhibited net calcium absorption (J net) in the duodenum through suppression of mucosato-serosa flux (J m----s). Jm----s was reduced from 2.21 +/- 0.50 mumol Ca.h-1.g wet wt-1 in controls to 0.93 +/- 0.35 mumol Ca.h-1.g-1 in aluminum exposed sacs, and Jnet was reduced from 1.88 +/- 0.14 mumol Ca.h-1.g-1 to 0.55 +/- 0.41 mumol Ca.h-1.g-1 (P less than 0.001). Serosa-to-mucosa calcium flux (Js----m) was not similarly influenced by aluminum. Inhibition of Jm----s occurred whether aluminum was initially present on the mucosal or serosal side of the duodenal sac and inhibition of Jnet calcium by 2 muM A1 occurred at all ambient concentrations of calcium studied. In the ileum, aluminum had no effect on any component of calcium flux. Aluminum did not induce any suppression of glucose transport in either the duodenum or ileum, suggesting that the effect on calcium transport is relatively specific. These results suggest that aluminum inhibits calcium absorption in the duodenum through an effect on active mucosa-to-serosa transport, but has no effect on ileal calcium absorption, which in the rat is not mediated by an active process. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Both strains of mice were often used together as a model of human age-related hearing loss, with a primary decline in auditory high-frequency sensitivity. Auditory function was analysed by recording auditory brainstem response (ABR). Morphological alterations of mouse cochleae were studied by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The age-related elevation of ABR thresholds was more precipitous and the individual variability was larger in C57BL mice than that in CBA mice. Degeneration patterns of the organ of Corti were different between the two strains. In the old CBA-mouse cochlea, giant stereocilia on the inner hair cells (IHCs) and elevated pillar heads were evident. Some normal-looking outer hair cells (OHCs) still remained. In C57BL mice, however, early loss of OHCs and extensively damaged stereocilia constituted the primary lesions of the organ of Corti. After exposure to a 2-7 kHz steady noise of 120 dB SPL for 5 min at the age of 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 (only for CBA) months, compound and permanent threshold shifts (CTS and PTS) at middle frequencies (8-12.5 kHz) reduced with age in CBA mice but remained in C57BL mice. C57BL mice were more severely affected by noise than the age-matched CBA mice. The amount of recovery from CTS to PTS was, however, independent of age and strain. Pathological changes of the organ of Corti were correlated with noise-induced PTS. Possibilities for prediction of susceptible individuals were tested. At 6 months of age, there was only 2% risk of classifying C57BL mice as CBA mice by pre-exposure thresholds at the high frequency (31.5 kHz), but about 40% risk by CTS at the middle frequency (12.5 kHz), or vice versa. With increasing age, the progress of the interaction between noise trauma and aging had two phases for both strains of mice. First an additivity and then, at total threshold shifts of 30-50 dB, a blocking-like interaction were observed. The rate of progression in post-noise hearing loss did not exceed the spontaneous rate of age-related degeneration. The difference between exposed and non-exposed groups decreased with advancing age for both strains of mice.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Guide cannulae were implanted surgically at six anterior-posterior stereotaxic locations (AP, -4.4 to +2.8) and drugs were microinjected (0.5 microliter) at different depths in each region. The analgesic effects of naltrexone and mecamylamine were evaluated at those sites exhibiting sensitivity to the hyperalgesic actions of (-)-nicotine and EKC. Additional experiments evaluated the validity and reproducibility of the low-intensity thermally evoked tail avoidance response and a low intensity hot plate response in detecting hyperalgesia. The chemostimulation studies suggest that there are opioid and nicotinic hyperalgesic processes distributed throughout the dorsal regions of the posterior mesencephalic and pontomedullary brain stem. The relative hyperalgesic potency of (-)-nicotine appears to exhibit a gradient from the dorsal posterior mesencephalic tegmentum to the midmedullary region, whereas only analgesia was produced more rostrally, in the central gray, or caudally within the posterior medulla. Within regions intermediate between the dorsal posterior, mesencephalic tegmentum and posterior medulla, (-)-nicotine produced biphasic dose-response and time action curves. The effects of EKC were similar to those of (-)-nicotine at most sites although (-)-nicotine was 55 times more potent than EKC when administered in the most active hyperalgesic regions.2+ may differ from region to region. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The originality of the method consists of: (1) starting the culture for 3 days in a serum-free medium which allows attachment and neurite proliferation of neurons as well as the death of non-neuronal cells (mainly consisting of astrocytes); (2) introducing a limited amount of fetal calf serum (FCS) (2-5%) after 3 days in vitro (3 DIV), which likely provides optimal neuronal survival and attachment factors, and a limited amount of astrocyte proliferating factors. The period of introduction of serum, as well as the amount of serum introduced are critical factors. By phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that neurons continued to develop neurite extensions, synaptic vesicles and synapse formations up to 50 DIV. Neuronal membranes, and synaptic contacts were particularly healthy up to 50 DIV. Interestingly, the number of astrocytes was constant between 30-50 DIV and limited to about 10%. We therefore obtained an equilibrium between neuronal and astrocyte differentiation and proliferation. It is likely that the small population of astrocytes, plus the low percentage of FCS added, provide essential factors for neuronal survival and differentiation, whereas a high density of differentiated neurons inhibited astrocyte cell proliferation. The clear-cut stability of these neuronal cultures goes in parallel with the stability of the pharmacological responses studied here: the coupling of carbachol and quisqualate receptors with the inositol phosphate production system. The culture method described here could be of particular interest to pursue biochemical, pharmacological and biological studies on neurons as well as on reciprocal interactions between neurons and astrocytes. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Here, we report a characterization of the genomic organization of MSD1 and its pattern of expression within cellular N-CAM RNA and polypeptide species. S1 nuclease protection analyses and sequence analysis of an N-CAM human genomic clone containing MSD1 sequences indicated that MSD1 is comprised of three discrete exons of 15, 48, and 42 bp, designated MSD1a, MSD1b, and MSD1c, respectively. Although the MSD1a exon was present in a small proportion of mRNAs from both brain and muscle cells, the entire MSD1 sequence occurred predominantly in mRNAs from differentiated myotube cells. In addition, antiserum raised to a synthetic, MSD1b-encoded peptide sequence was found to stain the cell surface of human skeletal myotubes in culture, whereas myoblasts, fibroblasts, and neural cells were negative. MSD1a, MSD1b, and MSD1c sequences thus arise collectively in N-CAM mRNA and polypeptide isoforms as a result of muscle tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative mRNA splicing events. In addition, the occurrence of brain and muscle mRNAs containing only MSD1a indicate that alternative splicing may occur within the MSD region itself to generate further diversity. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Sucrose (8%) feeding for 72 h of such undernourished (UN) rats immediately after 60 days reverted the depressed NST capacity to levels comparable to control values while the BMR was higher by about 9 per cent than controls. The actual increase in NST and BMR of UN rats after 72 h of sucrose feeding was about 12 and 14 per cent respectively when compared to the values before sucrose feeding. This is possibly because sucrose feeding is known to elevate the caloric intake by 20-30 per cent over normal and would stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The results thus would imply that the reduced NST and BMR in rats consequent to undernutrition is probably due to diminished SNS activity which may be associated with changes in some hormonal and brown adipose tissue functions. However, such changes appear to be limited only to the period of undernutrition as it can be corrected speedily by adequate energy supplementation. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

RYR1 was consequently postulated as the candidate for the molecular defect causing MHS, and a point mutation in the gene has now been identified and is thought to be the cause of MH in at least some MHS patients. Here we report the results of a linkage study done with 19q12-13.2 markers, including the RYR1 cDNA, in two Bavarian families with MHS. In one of the families, three unambiguous recombination events between MHS and the RYR1 locus were found. In the second family only one informative meiosis was seen with RYR1. However, segregation analysis with markers for D19S75, D19S28, D19S47, CYP2A, BCL3, and APOC2 shows that the crossovers in the first family involve the entire haplotype defined by these markers flanking RYR1 and, furthermore, reveals multiple crossovers between these haplotypes and MHS in the second family. In these families, pairwise and multipoint lod scores below -2 exclude MHS from an interval spanning more than 26 cM and comprising the RYR1 and the previously described MHS locus. Our findings thus strongly suggest genetic heterogeneity of the MHS trait and prompt the search for another MHS locus. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

In the case of the latter three species, however, 6 out of the 7 strains were isolated from patients who were excreting other enteric pathogens, whereas only 2 out of 9 enterotoxigenic E. coli patients had concomitant infections with other pathogens. No invasive bacteria were isolated except for 2 shigella strains. Salmonella and shigella strains were found in four patients. No correlation was found between the enteropathogenicity of E. coli and its serotype. Rotavirus was observed by negative staining electron microscopy in only two patients (6%) but using a reverse complement fixation test rotavirus antigen was detected in the stool of 17 out of 35 patients (49%). The low EM detection rate may well be due to the patients being admitted for treatment late in the course of their illness when the degree of viral shedding has decreased below EM detectability.

No further significant increase of mean serum total homocysteine concentrations was observed after serum folate became subnormal.

For the production of tolbutamide agglomerates by the QESD method, a necessary condition was the addition of a sucrose fatty acid ester to the system as an emulsifying agent. The particle diameter of the agglomerates obtained by the QESD method depended on the size of the initially formed quasi-emulsion droplets, which in turn depended on the viscosity of the solution. In addition, the agglomerates were nearly perfectly spherical in shape. In the QESD method, the quasi-emulsion droplets crystallized instantaneously from the droplet surface inward. The resultant agglomerates were dense, had great mechanical strength and showed excellent flowability due to their perfect spherical shape. On the other hand, the agglomerates produced by the SC method were conglomerates of primary crystals, and fine, needle-like crystals formed on their surface. As a result, these agglomerates had a large specific surface area, and they therefore showed greater solubility than the agglomerates prepared by the QESD method. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

At that time, cryptosporidiosis was thought to be an infrequent infection in animals and rarely an opportunistic infection in humans. The concept of Cryptosporidium spp. as pathogens has changed dramatically within the past 8 years because of improved diagnostic techniques, increased awareness within the biomedical community, and the development of basic research programs in numerous laboratories. Presently, greater than 1,000 publications including over 400 case reports in the biomedical literature address Cryptosporidium spp. and cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium parvum is now thought to be one of the three most common enteropathogens causing diarrheal illness in humans worldwide, especially in developing countries. It is likely that cryptosporidiosis was previously included in the 25 to 35% of diarrheal illness with unknown etiology. Because of the severity and length of diarrheal illness and because no effective therapy has been identified, cryptosporidiosis is one of the most ominous infections associated with AIDS. The role of C. parvum as an enteropathogen is well established; documentation of its role as a cause of hepatobiliary and respiratory diseases is now appearing in the literature. Our present understanding of the natural history, epidemiology, biology, and immunology of Cryptosporidium spp. as well as the clinical features, pathogenicity, and treatment of cryptosporidiosis are reviewed here. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The myelin deficits show marked regional variation, with spinal cord mildly affected and many brain regions severely affected by morphologic criteria. In this study, levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) were measured by immunoblotting in samples prepared from spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral hemispheres of normal and affected goats at 2-4 days (newborns) and 2-4 weeks of age. In affected goats, total levels of MBP in spinal cord were normal, while PLP levels were 60-70% of normal at both ages. In contrast, PLP and MBP in brainstem and cerebral hemispheres were severely decreased at both ages, with levels of PLP 10-13% and MBP 25-29% of normal in newborns, and generally more reduced at 2-4 weeks. When myelin fractions were isolated on 0.32/0.85 M sucrose gradients, yields were about 38 and 25% of normal in spinal cord at the two ages, but less then 3% of normal in brainstem. Yields of myelin-like fraction were decreased as well, but to lesser extents than yields of myelin. Myelin from spinal cord had a normal composition with regard to PLP and MBP content, while the myelin fraction from brainstem was markedly deficient in both proteins. This suggests formation of myelin with a very abnormal composition in brainstem, or inclusion of large amounts of membranes other than myelin in this fraction. The more severe deficits in brainstem and cerebral hemispheres compared to spinal cord are consistent with morphologic observations.\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The aim of this study was to elucidate their role in experimental coronary thrombosis. In 46 open-chest dogs with a critical coronary stenosis produced by plicating the coronary artery wall with a suture, blood flow showed cyclical reductions followed by an abrupt return to control levels. The flow reduction were previously shown to be caused by platelet aggregation. In the present study they were unaffected by heparin (1,000 U . kg-1 . h-1) at the start of the experiment but consistently abolished by aspirin (30 mg . kg-1) at the end of the protocol, further supporting platelet aggregation as the primary mechanism. After 1 h of observation, dogs were assigned to one of the following groups: control (no intervention, n = 9), phentolamine (a nonselective alpha-blocker) \"low dose\" (0.07 mg . kg-1 bolus followed by 0.1 mg . kg-1 . min-1, n = 4), phentolamine \"high-dose\" (3 mg . kg-1 bolus followed by 0.07 mg . kg-1 . min-1, n = 6), prazosin (an alpha 1-blocker, 2 mg . kg-1, n = 8), yohimbine (an alpha 2-blocker, 3 mg . kg-1, n = 11) or prazosin + yohimbine (same doses, n = 8). In controls, cyclical reductions in flow continued unchanged for another hour. Phentolamine effected a partial dose-related inhibition of flow reductions; however, prazosin and yohimbine, given separately or in combination, failed to produce any significant effect despite an alpha-blocking action equivalent to or greater than that of phentolamine (alpha-agonist dose-response studies).\\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Intracoronary stenting was developed to avoid these complications by pressing the intimal and medial flaps against the vessel wall, thus reducing the risk of acute thrombosis. A total of 22 stents were implanted into the coronary arteries of 15 patients with dissections after balloon angioplasty causing angina pectoris or ischemic electrocardiographic changes. Stent delivery was successful in all cases. In 1 patient acute stent thrombosis was documented and treated successfully by thrombolytic therapy. Another patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery 24 hours later because of persisting angina. Angiograms after 24 hours documented vessel patency in the remaining 14 patients. Late control angiograms after 4 to 6 months were obtained in 12 of 14 patients. Vessel patency without significant restenosis was observed in 8 patients, restenosis in 3 and reocclusion in 1 patient. All 3 patients with multiple stent implantation had restenosis (n = 2) or reocclusion (n = 1), compared with 1 patient with single stent implantation. Thus, intracoronary stenting appears to be a secure and effective method of handling bailout situations caused by dissection after balloon angioplasty, with good long-term results when only a single stent is implanted. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by left MCA occlusion in rats. Brain osmolality was determined with a vapor pressure osmometer, water content of the brain tissue was measured by wet and dry weight, and the tissue sodium and potassium contents were assayed by flame photometry. Permeability of BBB was tested by EB. These measurements were made from the cortical core of MCA territory at various intervals from 1 hr to 14 days after occlusion. Brain osmolality increased from 311 +/- 2 mOsm/kg (M +/- SE) to 329 +/- 2 mOsm/kg (n = 7, p less than 0.01) by 6 hrs after occlusion. Serum osmolality did not significantly change. The osmotic gradient between blood and the brain was about 26 mOsm/kg. Brain osmolality then decreased to 310 +/- 2 mOsm/kg by 12 hr after occlusion and remained about the same level for up to 14 days. Water content progressively increased within 1 day, then gradually decreased by 14 days. Sodium plus potassium content of the brain tissue did not increase and EB extravasation was not seen within 6 hr of occlusion. These findings indicate that an osmotic pressure gradient contributes to the formation of edema only during the early stage of cerebral ischemia. Brain osmolality is not related to tissue electrolyte change and BBB disruption to protein. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

Discriminatory rules regarding the license to drive are based mainly on concerns that treatment with blood glucose-lowering agents, especially insulin--may induce episodes of altered consciousness due to hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia, however, differs greatly among insulin-requiring diabetics and it is not difficult to identify those few who present a substantial risk. Moreover, the advent of simple, portable devices for blood glucose self-monitoring allows diabetics to know when blood glucose levels are becoming low and to take prompt corrective action. Thus, it would seem that blanket rules prohibiting diabetics from driving certain types of vehicles are unfair and unwarranted. In view of these considerations, rules are being revised by some licensing agencies to eliminate blanket restrictions and to allow for case-by-case evaluations to determine medical qualifications of people with diabetes. Tight control of diabetes currently is being advocated widely as a means of preventing chronic complications, but it carries an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Physicians who institute tight control regimens must ensure that patients understand the potential risk of hypoglycemia and are capable of minimizing the risk. Physicians should report patients to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) who, in their judgement, are unable to drive safely because of concerns about hypoglycemia. Wisconsin state law protects physicians who make such reports from liability. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The health status of its peoples has risen dramatically during the past 40 years. The reasons for these achievements are complex and include an ideology of equity for all citizens, the near universal availability of adequate food, education, housing, jobs, and transport, and the universal availability of accessible and affordable treatment and preventive health services. Despite these achievements China is facing new problems. These include the aging of the population, continued growth of the population leading to ever increasing demands on all sectors of the economy including health services, urban-rural inequalities, low productivity in the health services, lack of legal safeguards for health protection, a continued burden of infectious and endemic diseases, weak infrastructure for prevention and primary health care, and an increasing burden of chronic diseases associated with tobacco smoking and atherosclerotic circulatory diseases and trauma due to traffic accidents and occupational hazards. Decentralized management, financial incentives for health workers, privatization of medical practitioners, health legislation, and changes to health insurance arrangements have been introduced as a means of addressing the issues. The outcomes have been uneven, with little or no improvements in some problems and good progress in others. Changes in the health system appear to be reflecting not only health reform measures but also general economic reforms. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

CD36 is also expressed on platelets and appears to be identical to platelet glycoprotein IV. We investigated receptor activation of monocytes and platelets by anti-CD36 MAbs and by IRBC. Incubation of human monocytes with anti-CD36 MAbs or IRBC resulted in stimulation of the respiratory burst as measured by reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and generation of chemiluminescence. Incubation of human platelets with anti-CD36 MAbs resulted in platelet activation as measured by aggregation or ATP secretion. Activation of monocytes and platelets required appropriate intracellular transmembrane signaling and was inhibited by calcium antagonists or by specific inhibitors of protein kinase C or guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Soluble CD36 inhibited binding of IRBC to both monocytes and platelets, suggesting that these interactions are mediated by the CD36 receptor. Using a cytochemical electron microscopic technique, the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates was identified at the interface between human monocytes and IRBC. These data provide support for the hypothesis that reactive oxygen intermediates produced by monocytes when IRBC ligands interact with cell surface receptors may play a role in the pathophysiology of falciparum malaria. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

By scanning electron microscopy, the plucked hairs showed a typical moniliform feature composed of alternated nodes and internodes. By computer stereography, reconstructed three-dimensional models of in vivo hair structures showed that the diameter of hair shaft was partially reduced in the keratogenous zone and that the reduction was severe in the hair cortex and cuticle layers but mild in the inner root sheath. By transmission electron microscopy, a significant degeneration of hair matrix cells was found, and a zig-zag disarray of cortical tonofibrils and invaginations of the hair cuticle cells into the cortex were noticed in the suprabulbar portion. In some hairs, the hair bulbs showed no degeneration, but a degeneration of cortical cells and invaginations of hair cuticle were seen in some portions in the developing zone of the cortex. This suggests that not every hair matrix is damaged in a synchronized fashion, but individual hairs are affected independently. Furthermore, in all the hair and hair follicles examined, cytoplasmic vacuolations were always seen in the various layers, and abnormal formation of tonofibrils was often observed in the cortex. In monilethrix, a cell abnormality may inherently be present in the hair tissue and, when such abnormality occurs severely, the cortical cells are particularly affected in the hair matrix. This seems to result in a decrease in number of cortical cells and thinning of the hair shaft. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The influx of phosphate through capillary membranes was studied by incubation with [32Pi]phosphate followed by a rapid filtration technique. Phosphate uptake by brain capillaries was mediated by a saturable high-affinity system which is independent of the sodium concentration in the incubation medium. The apparent half-saturation constant (Km) and maximal influx (Vmax) were estimated to 160 microM and 0.37 nmol/mg protein/30 s. Transport was inhibited by the phosphate analogues arsenate and phosphonoformic acid with apparent inhibition constants of 5 and 11 mM, respectively. The metabolic inhibitors cyanide and ouabain had no effect on the transport activity. Competition experiments showed that phosphate uptake was inhibited up to 41% by various anions (pyruvate, acetate, citrate, glutamate, and sulfate). In addition, phosphate uptake was significantly decreased by two selective inhibitors of anionic exchangers, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. Chloride was not a substrate of the phosphate carrier as the replacement of external chloride, by nitrate, thiocyanate, or gluconate, did not increase phosphate transport. Aminohippuric acid and N'-methylnicotinamide, two specific substrates of anionic and cationic drug exchangers, did not compete with the phosphate carrier of cerebral capillaries. However, trans-stimulation with bicarbonate increased phosphate transport by 28%, and this stimulation was inhibited by 1 mM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, suggesting that the carrier of the cerebral capillaries could exchange phosphate with bicarbonate. \\n\\n### Respone:\",\n",

The recemic mixture is usually used as an antischistosomal drug, however the antischistosomal activity is mainly concentrated in the R (-)-enantiomer. This study was undertaken to investigate the stereoselectivity of the arrhythmogenic effect of PQT in conscious rabbits. Arrhythmias, as well as bradycardia, were induced in rabbits by iv (+/-) PQT or its enantiomers at 45 mg/kg. The frequency of ectopic rhythms in the (+), (+/-) and (-) PQT groups were 100, 60 and 20%, respectively. Statistically, the frequency of ectopic rhythms in the (+) PQT group was significantly higher than those in the (-) PQT group and in the (+/-) PQT group, although there was no significant difference between the (+/-) and (-) PQT groups. The severity of the arrhythmias induced by (+) PQT was much higher than that induced by (-) PQT. The bradycardia action of (+) PQT was much more intense than that of (-) PQT. (+/-) PQT or its enanthiomers (icv) at a dose of 2 or 3 mg/kg also induced arrhythmias. The frequency of ectopic rhythms in the (+) PQT group was significantly higher than that in the (-) PQT group. The results suggest that there is a stereoselectivity of the arrhythmogenic effects of PQT in rabbits.

We have studied bacterial phospholipid hydrolysis as a possible limiting factor in the disassembly of ingested E. coli, comparing the fates, during phagocytosis by rabbit peritoneal exudate PMN, of three isogenic strains, differing in their content of the pldA gene encoding the principal E. coli phospholipase A (PLA), i.e., pldA-, pldA+, pldA (the latter strain bearing the pldA gene in a multicopy plasmid resulting in a 20-fold increase in PLA content). Ingestion and growth inhibition (greater than 99% within 15 min) were the same for the three strains, but phospholipid degradation differed according to bacterial PLA content: pldA up to 60%, pldA+ up to 30%, and pldA- up to 20%. Since the pldA- strain has no activatable PLA, phospholipid degradation in this strain demonstrates the action of a PMN PLA. Added PLA2-rich ascitic fluid (AF) or purified AF PLA2 increased the rate and extent of degradation of the pldA- strain, provided the enzyme was added before ingestion was complete. 125I-AF-PLA2 binds to both E. coli and PMN and thus can enter the vacuole during phagocytosis. Although up to 50-fold more AF-PLA2 than the PLA2 content of the PMN could be loaded into the PMN in this way, degradation of pldA- E. coli did not exceed 30%. Increased phospholipid degradation had no effect on the degradation of bacterial macromolecules. In contrast, bacterial disassembly manifest as structural disorganization, release of bacterial protein derived material, and inhibition of protein synthesis were markedly enhanced when greater than 50% of prelabelled bacterial phospholipids were degraded. These findings reveal a link between envelope phospholipid degradation and overall bacterial destruction, suggesting therefore that factors limiting PLA action limit the destruction of E. coli ingested by PMN. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The analogs, which were made by site-directed mutagenesis of a synthetic gene encoding for IGF I, are [Gln 3, Ala 4, Tyr 15, Leu 16] IGF I and an analog in which the first 16 amino acids of IGF I were replaced with the first 17 amino acids of insulin (B-chain mutant). These two peptides have 100-fold and greater than 1,000-fold lower affinity, respectively, than IGF I for the 28 K binding protein present in the conditioned medium of two cell types, the clonal rat vascular smooth muscle line A10, and BALB/C 3T3 cells. The 28 K protein secreted by BALB/C 3T3 cells has fivefold-lower apparent affinity for both IGF I and [Gln 3, Ala 4, Tyr 15, Leu 16] IGF I than does the 28 K protein secreted by A 10 cells. Conditioned medium from these two cell types has similar amounts of unoccupied 28 K protein as evidenced by the ability of 125I-IGF I to specifically bind to and be covalently bound to the protein after treatment with the bifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate. In the presence of 0.1% calf serum, IGF I and [Gln 3, Ala 4, Tyr 15, Leu 16] IGF I stimulate DNA synthesis in A10 cells with ED50 = 0.4 nM, and in BALB/C 3T3 cells with ED50 = 10 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively. Thus, these peptides are equipotent in A10 cells, but the mutant peptide is ten times more active than IGF I in BALB/C 3T3 cells. A10 cells can be made ten times less sensitive to IGF I by performing the incubation in the presence of conditioned media from BALB/C 3T3 cells but not from A10 cells. The activity of [Gln 3, Ala 4, Tyr 15, Leu 16] IGF I is not altered under these conditions. Thus, the conditioned media, which contain 28 K proteins secreted by A10 cells and BALB/C 3T3 cells, have different effects on the biological action of IGF I. These data suggest that the 28 K binding proteins can have important effects on the sensitivity of tissues to IGF I and that the B-chain mutant and [Gln 3, Ala 4, Tyr 15, Leu 16] IGF I will be useful in assessing the biological role of these proteins. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",

The spectral parameters: EMG total power (PEMG), mean (MPF) and median (MED) power frequencies, which are the most representative of the EMG spectral content, were calculated according to the EMG activity of the vastus medialis muscle (VM) and soleus muscle (SOL) of the right leg. For VM and SOL, PEMG increased linearly with exerted power demonstrating an enhancement of MU recruitment. Moreover these relationships were less scattered when exerted power was expressed as a percentage of VO2max. Changes in MPF and MED with varying exercise intensities were different from one subject to another. For a set of subjects, MPF and MED were found to be independent of exerted power. Although VM and SOL muscles are different in fibre type composition, similar results were obtained for both EMG activities. We have concluded that for dynamic contractions performed at different intensities below VO2max, the recruitment of the MU has a poor effect on the EMG spectral content whatever the predominant type of fibre. \\n\\n### Respone:',\n",
