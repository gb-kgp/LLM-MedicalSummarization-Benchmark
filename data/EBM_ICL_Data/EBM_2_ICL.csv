Query 1: What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults?
Document 1: Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.
Summary 1: In the placebo-controlled diabetes prevention program trial, metformin use was associated with a reduction in progression to diabetes mellitus (NNT=14).

Query 2: Can type 2 diabetes be prevented through diet and exercise?
Document 2: Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin.

Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.
Summary 2: The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group1 randomized 3234 patients age >24 years without diabetes but with impaired glucose tolerance and a body mass index >24 to 1 of 3 groups: intensive lifestyle modification, metformin, or control; they then compared the incidence of diabetes over 3 years. Patients were men and women from primary care populations and represented diverse ethnic backgrounds. Investigators defined impaired glucose tolerance as plasma glucose of 140 to 200 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g glucose bolus when the fasting glucose was <140 mg/dL. Intensive lifestyle intervention comprised individual training sessions on a low-calorie, low-fat diet, aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking), and behavior modification. Case managers met with each participant for at least 16 sessions during the first 24 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. The control group received lifestyle change recommendations without individualized attention. After 24 weeks, 50% of the lifestyle group met the 7% weight loss goal and 74% were exercising at least 150 minutes per week. At the final visit, 38% maintained their target weight and 58% met their exercise goal. Lifestyle intervention produced greater weight reduction and increased activity compared with the metformin and control groups, with a corresponding decreased incidence of diabetes. Subgroup analysis found that lifestyle intervention produced the greatest reduction in diabetes (71%) for patients aged >60 years.

Summary:","In the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), 3234 patients with IGT and a body-mass index (BMI) of at least 24 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: placebo, metformin, or intensive lifestyle modification. After an average follow-up of 2.8 years, there was a 14% absolute risk reduction in the progression to diabetes in the lifestyle intervention group compared with placebo (number needed to treat [NNT]=7). Successful lifestyle interventions included weight loss of 5% to 7%, decreased fat intake, increased fiber intake, and 150 minutes of exercise per week."

Query 1: Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality?
Document 1: The outcome among patients with clinical stage I cancer that is detected on annual screening using spiral computed tomography (CT) is unknown. In a large collaborative study, we screened 31,567 asymptomatic persons at risk for lung cancer using low-dose CT from 1993 through 2005, and from 1994 through 2005, 27,456 repeated screenings were performed 7 to 18 months after the previous screening. We estimated the 10-year lung-cancer-specific survival rate among participants with clinical stage I lung cancer that was detected on CT screening and diagnosed by biopsy, regardless of the type of treatment received, and among those who underwent surgical resection of clinical stage I cancer within 1 month. A pathology panel reviewed the surgical specimens obtained from participants who underwent resection. Screening resulted in a diagnosis of lung cancer in 484 participants. Of these participants, 412 (85%) had clinical stage I lung cancer, and the estimated 10-year survival rate was 88% in this subgroup (95% confidence interval [CI], 84 to 91). Among the 302 participants with clinical stage I cancer who underwent surgical resection within 1 month after diagnosis, the survival rate was 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95). The 8 participants with clinical stage I cancer who did not receive treatment died within 5 years after diagnosis. Annual spiral CT screening can detect lung cancer that is curable.
Summary 1: A 2006 study followed a cohort of at-risk patients using low-dose computerized tomography screening. There were 31,567 patients evaluated initially, of which 27,456 had an annual repeat screening. Most patients were current or former smokers (83%); patients with exposure to occupational and secondhand smoke were also included. A positive initial screen was defined as a solid or partly solid noncalcified nodule ≥5 mm in diameter; a nonsolid, noncalcified nodule ≥8 mm in diameter; or a solid endobronchial nodule. A positive screen during follow-up was defined as any new noncalcified nodule, regardless of size. Positive tests occurred in 13% of baseline screens and 5% of annual screens. Biopsies were performed according to a study protocol based on a nodule's size and behavior over time. Out of a total of 5646 positive screens, there were 535 biopsies, and a diagnosis of cancer in 492 patients. Of those with cancer, 412 (84%) had clinical stage I lung cancer; the authors estimated their 10-year survival rate was 88% (95% CI, 84%-91%). If patients with stage I disease underwent surgical resection within 1 month of diagnosis, their estimated 10-year survival increased to 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%).

Query 2: Is yearly chest x-ray screening helpful in reducing mortality for smokers?
Document 2: The study was launched in the mid-1970s to explore the capability of screening by chest X-ray and sputum cytology to be used as an effective component of the lung cancer control program in the Czech Republic, a Central European country with a high and increasing occurrence of lung cancer in men at that time. A complementary objective of this report is to ascertain whether the cumulative numbers of lung cancer deaths would equalize in the two randomized groups during a prolonged follow-up period. Six thousand three hundred sixty-four males who were heavy cigarette smokers, aged 40-64 years, were enrolled during a general health survey in 6 districts of the Czech Republic. At initial X-ray and sputum examination, 19 prevalent lung carcinoma cases were diagnosed. After stratified randomization, the remaining subjects entered a 3-year study: the intervention group (3171 participants) was subjected to semiannual chest X-rays and sputum investigation whereas the controls (3174 participants) had 1 examination only by chest X-rays and sputum investigation, 3 years after entry. During a further 3-year follow-up, a chest X-ray was taken at the end of Years 4, 5, and 6 for both the intervention and control groups. Subjects in both groups who were suspected to have lung carcinoma or other disease on the basis of screening results or symptoms were subjected to appropriate diagnostic studies and treatment. Data on all causes of death in Years 1-6 and on deaths from the lung cancer in Years 7-15 of participants in the intervention and control groups were compared. The incidence rate of lung carcinoma from the intervention group was significantly higher than from the controls in the initial 3-year study period (P < 0.05), but not for the initial 6-year period (P = 0.06). Lung carcinoma cases detected by screening were identified at an earlier stage, were more often resectable, and had a significantly better survival than interval cases diagnosed mainly because of symptoms. There was no significant difference in the lung cancer mortality rate between the 2 groups in the initial 3-year study period or during follow-up prolonged up to Year 15 since enrollment. The study gave no evidence that screening for lung cancer by chest X-ray is beneficial in terms of reducing mortality. Based on the results of this study, there is no justification to recommend semiannual screening as a component of a comprehensive lung cancer control program.
Summary 2: A trial involved male smokers who were randomized to undergo chest x-ray and sputum cytology either every 6 months or after 3 years. After 3 years, both groups were screened annually with chest x-ray alone for an additional 3 years. There was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality at any point, including at a 15-year post-trial follow-up.

Query: Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality?
Document: Current and former smokers are currently being screened for lung cancer with computed tomography (CT), although there are limited data on the effect screening has on lung cancer outcomes. Randomized controlled trials assessing CT screening are currently under way. To assess whether screening may increase the frequency of lung cancer diagnosis and lung cancer resection or may reduce the risk of a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. Longitudinal analysis of 3246 asymptomatic current or former smokers screened for lung cancer beginning in 1998 either at 1 of 2 academic medical centers in the United States or an academic medical center in Italy with follow-up for a median of 3.9 years. Annual CT scans with comprehensive evaluation and treatment of detected nodules. Comparison of predicted with observed number of new lung cancer cases, lung cancer resections, advanced lung cancer cases, and deaths from lung cancer. There were 144 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer compared with 44.5 expected cases (relative risk [RR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-3.8; P<.001). There were 109 individuals who had a lung resection compared with 10.9 expected cases (RR, 10.0; 95% CI, 8.2-11.9; P<.001). There was no evidence of a decline in the number of diagnoses of advanced lung cancers (42 individuals compared with 33.4 expected cases) or deaths from lung cancer (38 deaths due to lung cancer observed and 38.8 expected; RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3; P = .90). Screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT may increase the rate of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, but may not meaningfully reduce the risk of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. Until more conclusive data are available, asymptomatic individuals should not be screened outside of clinical research studies that have a reasonable likelihood of further clarifying the potential benefits and risks.
Summary:","A cohort study using annual CT scanning to screen 3246 patients for lung cancer came to a different conclusion. The authors compared the observed number of lung cancer cases, resections, advanced lung cancer diagnoses, and deaths in screened patients with the expected rates based on validated prediction models. Lung cancer was diagnosed in 144 patients compared with 44 expected cases (RR=3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-3.8). Subsequently, 109 patients underwent lung resection compared with 11 expected (RR=10.0; 95% CI, 8.2-11.9). However, there was no decline in advanced cancers (42 actual vs 33 expected; P=.14) and no difference in deaths due to lung cancer (38 actual vs 38.8 expected; P=.9). The 81 patients diagnosed in this study with stage I disease who underwent surgical resection had 4-year estimated survival rates of 94% (95% CI, 85%-97%), matching the prior low-dose CT study."

Query: Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality?
Document: While population based screening for lung cancer has not been adopted by most countries, it is not clear whether sputum examinations, chest radiography or newer methods such as computed tomography are effective in reducing mortality from lung cancer. To determine whether screening for lung cancer using regular sputum examinations or chest radiography or CT chest reduces lung cancer mortality. Electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE and EMBASE; 1966 to July 2000) ), bibliographies, hand searching of a journal and discussion with experts were used to identify published and unpublished trials. Controlled trials of screening for lung cancer using sputum examinations, chest radiography or CT chest. Intention to screen analysis was performed. Where there was significant statistical heterogeneity relative risks were reported using the random effects model, but for other outcomes the fixed effect model was used. Seven trials were included (6 randomised controlled studies and 1 non-randomised controlled trial) with a total of 245,610 subjects. There were no studies with an unscreened control group. Frequent screening with chest x-rays was associated with an 11% relative increase in mortality from lung cancer compared with less frequent screening (RR 1.11, CI: 1.00-1.23). A non statistically significant trend was observed to reduced mortality from lung cancer when screening with chest x-ray and sputum cytology was compared with chest x-ray alone (RR 0.88, CI:0.74-1.03). Several of the included studies had potential methodological weaknesses. There were no controlled studies of spiral CT. The current evidence does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology. Frequent chest x-ray screening might be harmful. Further, methodologically rigorous trials are required.
Summary:","A Cochrane review identified 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 non-RCT (with a total of 245,610 patients) that screened patients with serial chest x-rays, with or without sputum cytology. Most patients were current or ex-smokers or had significant exposure to industrial smoke. No studies included an unscreened control group, and only 1 included women. Positive tests occurred in 13% of baseline screens and 5% of annual screens. Biopsies were performed according to a study protocol based on a nodule's size and behavior over time. Out of a total of 5646 positive screens, there were 535 biopsies, and a diagnosis of cancer in 492 patients.

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document 1: This review was designed to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on effects of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children. A systematic review of published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on probiotics in the treatment or prevention of acute diarrhea defined as >3 loose or watery stools per 24 hours in infants and children. The use of probiotics as compared with placebo was associated with a significantly reduced risk of diarrhea lasting >3 days. The pooled estimate risk was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.34-0.53) with a fixed-effect model, and remained significant in a random-effect model (0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.57). Only Lactobacillus GG showed a consistent effect. Probiotics significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea when compared with placebo, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis-the pooled, weighted, mean difference (WMD) assuming the random-effect model was -20.1 hours (95% CI, -26.1 to -14.2) and -24.8 (95% CI, -31.8 to -17.9) respectively. A meta-analysis of the prevention studies was not feasible because of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity. There is evidence of a clinically significant benefit of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis. Lactobacillus GG showed the most consistent effect, although other probiotic strains may also be effective. Further research is needed. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the prophylactic interventions preclude drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics in preventing acute gastroenteritis.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children. Lactobacillus supplementation reduced the risk of diarrhea persisting more than 3 days (relative risk [RR]=0.43; 95% CI, 0.34-0.53; P<.001; number needed to treat [NNT]=4).

Query 2: What is the best therapy for constipation in infants?
Document 2: The Authors investigated the effects of Allomin with admixture of 2% and 4% lactulose on constipation in infants aged 0-6 months reared on breast-milk substitutes. The investigation was randomized and double-blind and was carried out during the period 1.4.1987-31.7.1988 on non-hospitalized infants in the counties of Funen and North Jutland in cooperation with the health visitors in these regions. Constipation was defined as hard and difficult defaecation and the trial period lasted for 14 days. Parents of the infants who participated classified the infants' motions according to consistence and degree of difficulty in defaecation on special forms. A total of 220 children participated and these received, after randomizing, either Allomin-lactulose 2% or 4% as the only breast-milk substitute during the period of observation. The effect of treatment was defined as ""no constipation"" i.e. all motions during 24 hours described as easy and of normal or thin consistence. In addition, the effect was measured by the parents' general impression of what the infant thrived best on. With both of the preparations, treatment was effective in over 90% of the infants in both the groups without significant difference. The effect occurred gradually and, in some cases, up to 8-10 days after initiation of treatment without significant difference in the rate of effect between the groups. After the effect had commenced, significantly fewer thin motions occurred in the 2% group than in the 4% group. 92% of the infants in the 2% group and 91% in the 4% group wanted to continue the Allomin-lactulose preparation rather than the usual breast-milk substitute. A retrospective questionnaire to parents of 97 infants who had continued with Allomin-lactulose 2% was answered by 84.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: One uncontrolled trial of 220 functionally constipated, bottle-fed infants younger than 6 months showed normalization of stools in 90% of infants within 2 weeks of treatment with 2% or 4% lactulose. No other evidence has been published about the benefits or harms of sorbitol-containing juices, fiber, osmotic laxatives, formula switching, rectal stimulation with rectal thermometers, or glycerin suppositories.

Query: What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome?
Document: The aim of this study was to compare the response of symptoms and cytokine ratios in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with ingestion of probiotic preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 x 10 10 live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink, or the malted milk drink alone as placebo for 8 weeks. The cardinal symptoms of IBS were recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. Quality of life assessment, stool microbiologic studies, and blood sampling for estimation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 were performed at the beginning and at the end of the treatment phase. For all symptoms, with the exception of bowel movement frequency and consistency, those randomized to B infantis 35624 experienced a greater reduction in symptom scores; composite and individual scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and bowel movement difficulty were significantly lower than for placebo for those randomized to B infantis 35624 for most weeks of the treatment phase. At baseline, patients with IBS demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, indicative of a proinflammatory, Th-1 state. This ratio was normalized by B infantis 35624 feeding alone. B infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this organism, in this disorder.
Summary:","One RCT compared the probiotic formula Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 with Lactobacillus and placebo, and found that IBS symptom scores and quality of life measures were better with the Bifidobacterium preparation (P<.05)."

Query 1: What is the best duration of steroid therapy for contact dermatitis rhus?
Document 1: Contact dermatitis is a common reason for patient visits to primary-care clinics and represents up to 7% of all dermatologic consultations in the US. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the pathophysiology of contact dermatitis, particularly the allergic form. A better understanding of pathologic mechanisms has led to improved management of cases and will continue to advance treatment modalities. The present paper reviews the pathogenesis and current treatment of allergic contact dermatitis and speculates on the prospects for improved future therapy.
Summary 1: A review recommends using systemic steroids for severe cases, defined as involvement of greater than 20% of total body surface area, bullae formation, or extensive facial involvement. That review recommends a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/d, or 40 to 60 mg/d in adults, followed by a 2- to 3-week taper of oral prednisone.

Query 2: Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema?
Document 2: The incidence of refractory atopic dermatitis has increased in teenagers and young adults. The purpose of this study was to control the skin symptoms of such patients in daily life. Seventy patients repeatedly took a 10-min 42 degrees C acidic hot-spring bath twice daily. The skin symptoms were improved in 76% of cases. In 30 of 42 responders examined Staphylococcus aureus, detected on the skin surface, disappeared or decreased through balneotherapy. In contrast, S. aureus remained unchanged in 8 of 10 non-responders examined. Thus, the balneotherapy using acidic hot-spring water may be useful for controlling the skin symptoms of acute flares of refractory cases of atopic dermatitis.
Summary 2: In a case control study of 70 patients (ages 12-80 years, mean 23 years,) bathing in acidic hot spring water (42º C) helped control edema, erythema, exudation, and excoriation in refractory cases of eczema.

Query: What is the best duration of steroid therapy for contact dermatitis rhus?
Document: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) may account for at least 20% of all childhood dermatitis. Clinically, its morphology is identical to other forms of dermatitis in acute, subacute and chronic forms. A persistent or unusual and localized pattern is often the key to diagnosis. Treatment has centered around the use of corticosteroids, with the adjunct of antihistamines, wet dressings, and emollients for alleviation of symptoms. The newer topical immunosuppressives, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, may also hold promise as alternative therapies, although they have not been well-studied in this regard. Allergen identification, sometimes through patch testing and allergen avoidance are the keys to preventing recurrences of this disease.
Summary:",A review recommends using prednisone for children with allergic contact dermatitis involving more than 10% of the total body surface area.

Query 1: How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus?
Document 1: This study was undertaken to assess the safety of trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery. Retrospective cohort study of 308,755 Canadian women with previous cesarean delivery between 1988 and 2000. Occurrences of in-hospital maternal death, uterine rupture, and other severe maternal morbidity were compared between women with a trial of labor and those with an elective cesarean section. Rates of uterine rupture (0.65%), transfusion (0.19%), and hysterectomy (0.10%) were significantly higher in the trial-of-labor group. Maternal in-hospital death rate, however, was lower in the trial-of-labor group (1.6 per 100,000) than in the elective cesarean section group (5.6 per 100,000). The association between trial of labor and uterine rupture was stronger in low volume (<500) than in high volume (> or =500 births per year) obstetric units. Trial of labor is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture, but elective cesarean section may increase the risk of maternal death.
Summary 1: The effect of vaginal birth after cesarean on neonatal morbidity and mortality is unclear. A retrospective Canadian cohort trial of 308,755 women also demonstrated an association of vaginal birth after cesarean with uterine rupture(0.65% of trial-of-labor cases; OR=2.38; 95% CI, 2.12-2.67), and a trend towards higher maternal mortality in the cesarean group (1.6 per 100,000 for vaginal birth after cesarean vs 5.6 per 100,000 for planned cesarean; OR=0.32; 95% CI, 0.07-1.47).

Query 2: Should induction of labor be considered in a woman with a macrosomic baby?
Document 2: Suspected macrosomic fetuses are usually induced in order to reduce the risk of difficult operative delivery. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of a policy of labour induction for suspected fetal macrosomia on method of delivery and maternal or perinatal morbidity. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Randomised trials of induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women. Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Two trials involving 313 women were included. Compared to expectant management, induction of labour for suspected macrosomia did not reduce the risk of caesarean section (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.46) or instrumental delivery (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.98). Perinatal morbidity was similar between groups. Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women did not appear to alter the risk of maternal or neonatal morbidity.
Summary 2: The purpose of induction for fetal macrosomia would be to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidities. However, studies have shown that the incidence of cesarean and instrumented deliveries was not decreased, and perinatal morbidity was not changed.

Query: How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus?
Document: To evaluate the incidence and consequences of uterine rupture in women who have had a delivery by caesarean section. Systematic review. Medline, HealthSTAR, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, reference lists, and national experts. Studies in all languages were eligible if published in full. Methodological quality was evaluated for each study by using criteria from the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Uterine rupture was categorised as asymptomatic or symptomatic. We reviewed 568 full text articles to identify 71 potentially eligible studies, 21 of which were rated at least fair in quality. Compared with elective repeat caesarean delivery, trial of labour increased the risk of uterine rupture by 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 4.73) per 1000 cases. No maternal deaths were related to rupture. For women attempting vaginal delivery, the additional risk of perinatal death from rupture of a uterine scar was 1.4 (0 to 9.8) per 10,000 and the additional risk of hysterectomy was 3.4 (0 to 12.6) per 10 000. The rates of asymptomatic uterine rupture in trial of labour and elective repeat caesarean did not differ significantly. Although the literature on uterine rupture is imprecise and inconsistent, existing studies indicate that 370 (213 to 1370) elective caesarean deliveries would need to be performed to prevent one symptomatic uterine rupture.
Summary:","In an attempt to quantify the risks of VBAC, a systematic review determined that attempted VBAC, compared with repeat low-transverse cesarean section, increased the risk of uterine rupture by 2.7 per 1000 cases 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-4.73."

Query 1: What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD?
Document 1: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a syndrome of chronic progressive airflow limitation which occurs as a result of chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. However, the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD is controversial. We hypothesised that inhaled corticosteroids reduce the progression of airflow limitation in COPD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and data were analysed using random effects methodology. The effect of inhaled steroids on annual change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was determined for all trials, for trials with high dose treatment regimens, and for trials in subjects with moderate to severe airflow limitation. Data from eight controlled clinical trials of > or =2 years were included (n=3715 subjects). Meta-analysis of all study data revealed that inhaled corticosteroids reduce the rate of FEV1 decline by 7.7 ml/year (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 14.2, p=0.02). Meta-analysis of studies with high dose regimens revealed a greater effect of 9.9 ml/year (95% CI 2.3 to 17.5, p=0.01) compared with the meta-analysis of all studies. Inhaled corticosteroid treatment for > or =2 years slows the rate of lung function decline in COPD. The effect observed with high dose regimens is greater than that with all regimens combined. These data suggest a potential role for inhaled corticosteroids in modifying the long term natural history of COPD.
Summary 1: One meta-analysis evaluated 8 controlled clinical trials lasting at least 2 years (n=3715) and found that, when compared with placebo, inhaled glucocorticosteroids significantly reduced the rate of FEV1 decline by 7.7 mL/year (P=.02) and that high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids had a greater effect of 9.9 mL/year (P=.01).

Query 2: What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD?
Document 2: The care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has changed radically over the past 2 decades, and novel therapies can not only improve the health status of patients with COPD but also modify its natural course. To systematically review the impact of long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, nocturnal noninvasive mechanical ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation, domiciliary oxygen therapy, and disease management programs on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD. MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews from 1980 to May 2002 evaluating interventions in patients with COPD. We also hand searched bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomized controlled trials that had follow-up of at least 3 months and contained data on at least 1 of these clinical outcomes: health-related quality of life, exacerbations associated with COPD, or death. For pulmonary rehabilitation, we included studies that had a follow-up of at least 6 weeks. Using standard meta-analytic techniques, the effects of interventions were compared with placebo or with usual care. In secondary analyses, the effects of interventions were compared against each other, where possible. Long-acting beta2-agonists and anticholinergics (tiotropium) reduced exacerbation rates by approximately 20% to 25% (relative risk [RR] for long-acting beta2-agonists, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.90; RR for tiotropium, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89) in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Inhaled corticosteroids also reduced exacerbation rates by a similar amount (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80). The beneficial effects were most pronounced in trials enrolling patients with FEV1 between 1 L and 2 L. Combining a long-acting beta2-agonist with an inhaled corticosteroid resulted in an approximate 30% (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62-0.78) reduction in exacerbations. Pulmonary rehabilitation improved the health status of patients with moderate to severe disease, but no material effect was observed on long-term survival or hospitalization rates. Domiciliary oxygen therapy improved survival by approximately 40% in patients with PaO2 lower than 60 mm Hg, but not in those without hypoxia at rest. The data on disease management programs were heterogeneous, but overall no effect was observed on survival or risk of hospitalization. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was not associated with improved outcomes. A significant body of evidence supports the use of long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids in reducing exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Domiciliary oxygen therapy is the only intervention that has been demonstrated to prolong survival, but only in patients with resting hypoxia.
Summary 2: Some systematic reviews and other randomized trials suggest that inhaled glucocorticosteroids have significant benefit on these patient outcomes.

Query: What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD?
Document: There is no consensus on the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To evaluate the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the rate of FEV1 decline in patients with COPD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, and AMED databases and the Cochrane Library (1966 to December 2002), reference lists from identified articles, and consultation with experts. Searches were not limited to the English language. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials that examined the rate of FEV1 decline as a primary outcome in patients with COPD. Two reviewers independently extracted the data by using predetermined criteria. For the six studies that met the inclusion criteria, the summary estimate for the difference in FEV1 decline between the placebo and treatment groups was -5.0 +/- 3.2 mL/y (95% CI, -11.2 to 1.2 mL/y; P = 0.11). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with the rate of FEV1 decline in 3571 patients followed for 24 to 54 months.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 6 randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a duration of at least 2 years (n=3571) found a nonsignificant trend in favor of ICS, with a difference in FEV1 decline of 5.31 mL/year (P=.08) between the ICS and placebo groups."

Query 1: What are effective treatments for panic disorder?
Document 1: The etiology and optimum treatment of panic disorder remain unclear. Imipramine and alprazolam are reasonably well established treatments. Several reports have suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be effective for this condition. To investigate this issue, 27 published or presented placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of DSM-III or DSM-III-R panic disorder were subjected to meta-analysis. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors included paroxetine, fluvoxamine, zimelidine, and clomipramine. The standard treatments were imipramine or alprazolam. All three treatments were highly significantly superior to placebo in alleviating panic. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors were also significantly superior to both imipramine and alprazolam. The superiority of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors remained, but was less pronounced, when they were compared to the studies which used higher doses of imipramine or alprazolam. These findings underscore the importance of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of panic disorder and indirectly add to the evidence that serotonergic abnormalities may have a role in its etiology.
Summary 1: SSRIs were more effective than imipramine or alprazolam in a meta-analysis.

Query 2: Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain?
Document 2: Three previous reviews have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of antidepressants for patients with back pain. To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain. There is conflicting evidence whether antidepressants improve functional status of patients with chronic low back pain.
Summary 2: It appears that those with only SSRI activity are not effective improving chronic pain.

Query: How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail?
Document: Although antidepressants are often used for preventing chronic headache, their effectiveness is uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of English-language, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants as prophylaxis for chronic headache. Thirty-eight trials were included. Because some compared more than one drug with placebo, 44 study arms were combined using a random effects model. Twenty-five studies focused on migraines, 12 on tension headaches, and 1 on both. Nineteen used tricyclic antidepressants, 18 serotonin antagonists, and 7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients receiving antidepressants were twice as likely to report headache improvement (rate ratio [RR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 2.4). Because 31% (95% CI: 23% to 40%) more treated patients improved than those receiving placebo, clinicians would need to treat 3.2 patients for 1 patient to improve. The average amount of improvement (standardized mean difference) was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.2), an effect considered large. Treated patients also consumed less analgesic medication (standardized mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.94). There were no differences in outcomes among the three classes of agents studied or by the type of headache (migraine vs. tension), quality score, length of treatment, or percentage of patients lost to follow-up. Assessment of depression across studies was insufficient to determine if the effects were independent of depression. Antidepressants are effective in preventing chronic headaches. Whether this is independent of depression and whether there are differences in efficacy by class of agent needs further study.
Summary:","A meta-analysis from 2001 reviewed 38 RCTs of antidepressants as prophylaxis for chronic headache. Nineteen studies investigated TCAs, 18 examined serotonin blockers, and 7 focused on SSRIs. Patients taking antidepressants were twice as likely to report headache improvement rate ratio [RR]=2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.4, with the average amount of improvement considered to be large standard mean difference=0.94; 95% CI, 0.65-1.2. Serotonin blockers, most of which are not available or commonly used in the US, and TCAs were all effective in decreasing the headache burden, while the results for SSRIs were less clear. Dosages of amitriptyline ranged from 10 to 150 mg daily; most of the studies used 60 to 100 mg daily."

Query 1: Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia?
Document 1: Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first ""major vascular event"" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, ""intention-to-treat""), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.
Summary 1: The largest randomized controlled trials of a statin agent, the Heart Protection Study, enrolled more than 20,000 people and randomized them to simvastatin Zocor or placebo. After a median of 5 years of follow-up, there was no difference in cognitive scores or the rate of diagnosis of dementia between the 2 groups.

Query 2: Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia?
Document 2: Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol plays a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). For instance, an elevated serum cholesterol level has been shown to be a risk factor for AD. To determine whether patients taking 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), which are a group of medicines that inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol, have a lower prevalence of probable AD. The experiment uses a cross-sectional analysis comparing the prevalence of probable AD in 3 groups of patients from hospital records: the entire population, patients receiving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (hereafter referred to as the statins), and patients receiving medications used to treat hypertension or cardiovascular disease. The subjects studied were those included in the computer databases of 3 different hospitals for the years October 1, 1996, through August 31, 1998. Diagnosis of probable AD. We find that the prevalence of probable AD in the cohort taking statins during the study interval is 60% to 73% (P < .001) lower than the total patient population or compared with patients taking other medications typically used in the treatment of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. There is a lower prevalence of diagnosed probable AD in patients taking 2 different 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors-lovastatin and pravastatin. While one cannot infer causative mechanisms based on these data, this study reveals an interesting association in the data, which warrants further study. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1439-1443
Summary 2: An observational study of 56,790 charts included in the computer databases of 3 hospitals found that the prevalence of probable Alzheimer's dementia in the cohort taking statins was 60% to 73% P<.001 lower than in the total patient population or in patients taking antihypertensive or cardiovascular medications.

Query: Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia?
Document: : Two recent clinical reports describe an association between statin therapy and a reduction in the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease by as much as 70 %. One report is a cross-sectional analysis of discharges among three hospitals, and the other is a nested case control study drawn from ambulatory patients of general practitioners in the UK. Because neither study is a randomized trial, the association noted between statin therapy and a reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease may have occurred because other factors, unaccounted for in the studies, may be present (so called bias) and be responsible for the observed association. However, there is an expanding body of biological and epidemiological data that makes it plausible that statin therapy may retard or prevent the pathogenesis and clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease. This review was initiated in order to find other clinical evidence that might support or refute the hypothesized benefit of statin therapy. : The purpose is to review the evidence that treatment with statins reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. : The following data bases were searched: Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (1966-2000/12), EMBASE (1980-2000/12), and Psych Info (1987-2000/11). Search terms included statins,lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, alzheimer*, dement*, cogn*. : In order to be selected, trials needed to be randomized, doubled blinded, and of sufficient duration( probably years rather than weeks or months) to ascertain the preventive potential of statin therapy. : Data were to be extracted independently by two reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. The pooled odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences were to be estimated. : There were no randomized trials found in the search. : There is no good evidence to recommend statins for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. There is, however, a growing body of biological, epidemiological, and limited but non-randomized clinical evidence that lowering serum cholesterol may retard the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Mounting the clinical studies to determine the potential benefit of statin therapy should be a high priority for future research agendas.
Summary:","A systematic review concluded that no good evidence recommended statins for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's dementia. Notably, the review did find a body of inconclusive evidence that lowering serum cholesterol may retard disease pathogenesis."

Query 1: Do imaging studies aid diagnosis of acute sinusitis?
Document 1: The objective of this study was to assess the discriminative properties of the methods for diagnosing acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) in unselected patients. The study design was a systematic review of evaluation studies identified by using Medline, by searching reference lists, by hand searches, and by contacting investigators. Evaluation studies were conducted anywhere in the world. Subjects were adults with suspected AMS. Main outcome measures were: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios of the primary studies, weighted means of these parameters in each comparison (clinical examination, radiography, and ultrasound compared to a reference standard in diagnosing AMS), and summary ROC curves and their Q* points where sensitivity equals specificity. For the years from 1962 to present, 49 study reports were found; 11 articles on studies that included a total of 1144 patients were eligible. Compared to sinus puncture, radiography was the most accurate method for diagnosing AMS: the Q* point on the summary ROC curve was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.78-0.85). Ultrasound was slightly less accurate than radiography compared to sinus puncture (Q* 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83). Only two articles reported clinical examination compared to sinus puncture and the Q* for them was 0.75 (95% 0.58-0.86). Clinical examination is a rather unreliable method for diagnosing AMS, even in the hands of experienced specialists. Using radiography or ultrasound improves the accuracy of diagnosis. The diagnosis of AMS is rarely studied in primary care settings. Future comparative trials should preferably combine diagnosis and treatment, evaluating the two aspects of clinical management as unit.
Summary 1: Varonen concluded that clinical evaluation has a sensitivity of roughly 0.75, whereas radiographic methodologies have sensitivities>0.80.

Query 2: History, exam, and labs: Is one enough to diagnose acute adult appendicitis?
Document 2: The importance of specific elements in the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is controversial. This review analyses the diagnostic value of elements of disease history, clinical findings and laboratory test results in suspected appendicitis. A systematic Medline search was made of all published studies on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of appendicitis in patients admitted to hospital with suspected disease. Meta-analyses of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) areas, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, of 28 diagnostic variables described in 24 studies are presented. Inflammatory response variables (granulocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear blood cells, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein concentration), descriptors of peritoneal irritation (rebound and percussion tenderness, guarding and rigidity) and migration of pain were the strongest discriminators, with ROC areas of 0.78 to 0.68. The discriminatory power of the inflammatory variables was particularly strong for perforated appendicitis, with ROC areas of 0.85 to 0.87. Appendicitis was likely when two or more inflammatory variables were increased and unlikely when all were normal. Although all clinical and laboratory variables are weak discriminators individually, they achieve a high discriminatory power when combined. Laboratory examination of the inflammatory response, clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation, and a history of migration of pain yield the most important diagnostic information and should be included in any diagnostic assessment.
Summary 2: In a series of 439 patients with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, those with confirmed appendicitis (n=101) had a mean white blood cells count of 14.8 K/µL (95% CI, 13.9-15.8) and a mean neutrophil percentage of 82 (95% CI, 80-84). In contrast, those without appendicitis (n=338) had a mean white blood cells count of 9.2 K/µL (95% CI, 9.0-9.4) and a mean neutrophil percentage of 68 (95% CI, 66-70).

Query 1: Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening?
Document 1: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) as tools for identification of neonatal hearing impairment. A total of 4911 infants including 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units, 353 well babies with one or more risk factors for hearing loss (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 1994) and 80 well babies without risk factor who did not pass one or more neonatal test were targeted as the potential subject pool on which test performance would be assessed. During the neonatal period, they were evaluated using TEOAEs in response to an 80 dB pSPL click, DPOAE responses to two stimulus conditions (L1 = L2 = 75 dB SPL and L1 = 65 dB SPL L2 = 50 dB SPL), and ABR elicited by a 30 dB nHL click. In an effort to describe test performance, these ""at-risk"" infants were asked to return for behavioral audiologic assessments, using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) at 8 to 12 mo corrected age, regardless of neonatal test results. Sixty-four percent of these subjects returned and reliable VRA data were obtained on 95.6% of these returnees. This approach is in contrast to previous studies in which, by necessity, efforts were made to follow only those infants who ""failed"" the neonatal screening tests. The accuracy of the neonatal measures in predicting hearing status at 8 to 12 mo corrected age was determined. Only those infants who provided reliable, monaural VRA test results were included in the analysis. Separate analyses were performed without regard to intercurrent events (i.e., events between the neonatal and VRA tests that could cause their results to disagree), and then after accounting for the possible influence of intercurrent events such as otitis media and late-onset or progressive hearing loss. Low refer rates were achieved for the stopping criteria used in the present study, especially when a protocol similar to the one recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference Report was followed. These analyses, however, do not completely describe test performance because they did not compare neonatal screening test results with a gold standard test of hearing. Test performance, as measured by the area under a relative operating characteristic curve, were similar for all three neonatal tests when neonatal test results were compared with VRA data obtained at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. However, ABRs were more successful at determining auditory status at 1 kHz, compared with the otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests. Performance was more similar across all three tests when they were used to identify hearing loss at 2 and 4 kHz. No test performed perfectly. Using either the two- or three-frequency pure-tone average (PTA), with a fixed false alarm rate of 20%, hit rates for the neonatal tests, in general, exceeded 80% when hearing impairment was defined as behavioral thresholds > or =30 dB HL. All three tests performed similarly when a two-frequency (2 and 4 kHz) PTA was used as the gold standard; OAE test performance decreased when a three-frequency PTA (adding 1 kHz) was used as the gold standard definition. For both PTA and all three neonatal screening measures, however, hit rate increased as the magnitude of hearing loss increased. Singly, all three neonatal hearing screening tests resulted in low refer rates, especially if referrals for follow-up were made only for the cases in which stopping criteria were not met in both ears. Following a protocol similar to that recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference report resulted in refer rates that were less than 4%. TEOAEs at 80 dB pSPL, DPOAE at L1 = 65, L2 = 50 dB SPL and ABR at 30 dB nHL measured during the neonatal period, and as implemented in the current study, performed similarly at predicting behavioral hearing status at 8 to 12
Summary 1: Individually, OAE and ABR accurately diagnose neonatal hearing loss. One multicenter cohort of 2995 infants measured test performance of OAE and ABR against the gold standard (visual reinforcement audiometry performed at 8-12 months). The authors used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to plot speech awareness thresholds for both tests. When middle-ear pathology and progressive hearing loss were excluded, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for ABR and OAE were 0.91 and 0.94, respectively, indication that both tests had excellent test accuracy (a perfect test would have an area under the curve of 1.0).

Query 2: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 2: To determine the utility of pulse oximetry for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. We performed a cross-sectional study of 349 patients referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for possible OSA. A mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI) greater than or equal to 1 on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) defined OSA. A sleep laboratory physician read nocturnal oximetry trend and event graphs, blinded to clinical and polysomnographic results. Likelihood ratios were used to determine the change in probability of having OSA before and after oximetry results were known. Of 349 patients, 210 (60%) had OSA as defined polysomnographically. Oximetry trend graphs were classified as positive for OSA in 93 and negative or inconclusive in 256 patients. Of the 93 oximetry results read as positive, PSG confirmed OSA in 90 patients. A positive oximetry trend graph had a likelihood ratio of 19.4, increasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 97%. The median MOAHI of children with a positive oximetry result was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2). The 3 false-positive oximetry results were all in the subgroup of 92 children who had diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy that might have affected breathing during sleep. A negative or inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of.58, decreasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 47%. Interobserver reliability for oximetry readings was very good to excellent (kappa =.80). In the setting of a child suspected of having OSA, a positive nocturnal oximetry trend graph has at least a 97% positive predictive value. Oximetry could: 1) be the definitive diagnostic test for straightforward OSA attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children older than 12 months of age, or 2) quickly and inexpensively identify children with a history suggesting sleep-disordered breathing who would require PSG to elucidate the type and severity. A negative oximetry result cannot be used to rule out OSA.
Summary 2: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 349 children between the ages of 6 months and 18 years determined that abnormal home pulse oximetry studies were highly predictive of obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography (positive likelihood ratio [LR+]=19.4; CIs not given; posttest probability=97%), but that inconclusive or normal pulse oximetry studies were not predictive of negative polysomnographies (LR+=0.58; CIs not given; posttest probability 47%). Children had been referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea, and the pretest probability was 60%. Oximetry records were evaluated by a sleep laboratory physician blinded to clinical and polysomnography data.

Query: Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS?
Document: Home monitors designed to identify cardiorespiratory events are frequently used in infants at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but the efficacy of such devices for this use is unproven. To test the hypothesis that preterm infants, siblings of infants who died of SIDS, and infants who have experienced an idiopathic, apparent life-threatening event have a greater risk of cardiorespiratory events than healthy term infants. Longitudinal cohort study conducted from May 1994 through February 1998. Five metropolitan medical centers in the United States. A total of 1079 infants (classified as healthy term infants and 6 groups of those at risk for SIDS) who, during the first 6 months after birth, were observed with home cardiorespiratory monitors using respiratory inductance plethysmography to detect apnea and obstructed breathing. Occurrence of cardiorespiratory events that exceeded predefined conventional and extreme thresholds as recorded by the monitors. During 718 358 hours of home monitoring, 6993 events exceeding conventional alarm thresholds occurred in 445 infants (41%). Of these, 653 were extreme events in 116 infants (10%), and of those events with apnea, 70% included at least 3 obstructed breaths. The frequency of at least 1 extreme event was similar in term infants in all groups, but preterm infants were at increased risk of extreme events until 43 weeks' postconceptional age. In this study, conventional events are quite common, even in healthy term infants. Extreme events were common only in preterm infants, and their timing suggests that they are not likely to be immediate precursors to SIDS. The high frequency of obstructed breathing in study participants would likely preclude detection of many events by conventional techniques. These data should be important for designing future monitors and determining if an infant is likely to be at risk for a cardiorespiratory event.
Summary:","A prospective cohort study of 1079 infants monitored for cardiorespiratory events, the Collaborative Home Infant Monitor Evaluation (CHIME) study, demonstrated that prior to 43 weeks postconceptional age, preterm infants had a statistically significant greater risk of extreme events (apnea or bradycardia longer than 30 seconds) compared with healthy term infants (Table 2). After 43 weeks postconceptional age, there were no differences in incidence of apnea or bradycardia, comparing preterm and term infants. Neither preterm infants nor infants with apnea, bradycardia, or apparent life-threatening events had increased incidences of SIDS."

Query 1: Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain?
Document 1: To determine the effect of psychoeducational interventions on pain in adults with cancer. 25 intervention studies published from 1978-2001. When analyzed across all studies, a statistically significant, beneficial effect on pain was found. However, threats to validity were present in some studies. The most serious of these involved a lack of random assignment to treatment condition and a floor effect on pain. When limited to the studies with the best methodologic quality, the effect on pain continued to be statistically significant. Effect on pain by type of treatment was examined and found to be somewhat variable and limited by the small number of studies testing each type of treatment. Methodologic quality was variable. Reasonably strong evidence exists for relaxation-based cognitive-behavioral interventions, education about analgesic usage, and supportive counseling. Minimal data were available about the relative effectiveness of different types of psychoeducational interventions because few studies included within-study contrasts of different experimental interventions and usual care was not well documented. Psychoeducational interventions are not a substitute for analgesics, but they may serve as adjuvant therapy. Assessment and clinical judgment are critical. The intervention must be acceptable to patients and not too burdensome for patients in pain to use.
Summary 1: In adults with cancer pain, a recent meta-analysis of 1723 patients showed modest but significant effects on pain from psycho-educational interventions in 25 studies. Although just 3 of the studies lasted 52 weeks or longer, effects were found from good-quality studies for ""relaxation-promoting,"" educational, and supportive counseling plus content therapies.

Query 2: What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing?
Document 2: Both attenuated heart rate recovery following exercise and the Duke treadmill exercise score have been demonstrated to be independent predictors of mortality, but their prognostic value relative to each other has not been studied. To assess the associations among abnormal heart rate recovery, treadmill exercise score, and death in patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography. Prospective cohort study conducted in an academic medical center between September 1990 and December 1997, with a median follow-up of 5.2 years. A total of 9454 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 53 [11] years; 78% male) who underwent symptom-limited exercise electrocardiographic testing. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 30 years, history of heart failure or valvular disease, pacemaker implantation, and uninterpretable electrocardiograms. All-cause mortality, as predicted by abnormal heart rate recovery, defined as failure of heart rate to decrease by more than 12/min during the first minute after peak exercise, and by treadmill exercise score, defined as (exercise time) - (5 x maximum ST-segment deviation) - (4 x treadmill angina index). Three hundred twelve deaths occurred in the cohort. Abnormal heart rate recovery and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score were present in 20% (n = 1852) and 21% (n = 1996) of patients, respectively. In univariate analyses, death was predicted by both abnormal heart rate recovery (8% vs 2% in patients with normal heart rate recovery; hazard ratio [HR], 4.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.33-5.19; chi(2) = 158; P<.001) and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (8% vs 2% in patients with low-risk scores; HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.43-5.35; chi(2) = 164; P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, and other potential confounders, abnormal heart rate recovery remained predictive of death (among the 8549 patients not taking beta-blockers, adjusted HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.63-2.78; P<.001), as did intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (adjusted HR, 1. 49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92; P =.002). There was no interaction between these 2 predictors. In this cohort of patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography, both abnormal heart rate recovery and treadmill exercise score were independent predictors of mortality. Heart rate recovery appears to provide additional prognostic information to the established treadmill exercise score and should be considered for routine incorporation into exercise test interpretation. JAMA. 2000;284:1392-1398.
Summary 2: A prospective cohort study confirmed that a low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with high 5-year survival. Those with an intermediate- or high-risk duke treadmill exercise score had corresponding survival rates of 90% and 65%, respectively. The duke treadmill exercise score was further analyzed in a 5-year follow-up of 9454 patients, 88% of whom were low-risk (75% undergoing screening EST). Most patients (1406 of 1477) with ST-segment depression ≥1 mm had asymptomatic ischemia, only 71 having EST-induced angina. A low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with 98% survival, compared with 92% for patients with an intermediate- or high-risk DTS.

Query: Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS?
Document: More than 25 years have elapsed since continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring at home was suggested to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the ensuing interval, multiple studies have been unable to establish the alleged efficacy of its use. In this statement, the most recent research information concerning extreme limits for a prolonged course of apnea of prematurity is reviewed. Recommendations regarding the appropriate use of home cardiorespiratory monitoring after hospital discharge emphasize limiting use to specific clinical indications for a predetermined period, using only monitors equipped with an event recorder, and counseling parents that monitor use does not prevent sudden, unexpected death in all circumstances. The continued implementation of proven SIDS prevention measures is encouraged.
Summary:","Significant financial costs are associated with home monitoring. The average monthly cost is $300 to $400, not including physician fees. This would lead to an estimated annual cost of $24 million dollars if every infant <1500 grams in the United States were monitored."

Query 1: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document 1: Although sleep apnea is common, it often goes undiagnosed in primary care encounters. To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79. The Berlin Questionnaire provides a means of identifying patients who are likely to have sleep apnea.
Summary 1: The Berlin Questionnaire assesses snoring, daytime sleepiness, history of hypertension, age, and body mass index (BMI). The questionnaire was evaluated in 744 adults presenting for unrelated problems at 5 primary care sites. Of 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, a finding of high risk on the Berlin Questionnaire predicted an apnea-hypopnea index >5 with 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity, a positive likelihood ratio of 3.79.

Query 2: Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression?
Document 2: To test whether a cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program reduces the prevalence of depression during the first postnatal year in mothers of very preterm babies. Prospective, single blind, randomised, controlled study. Perinatal centre in Western Australia. One hundred and ninety-nine out of 673 English-speaking mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal unit. A six-session cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program provided by a research midwife between weeks two and six after birth. Women in the control group received standard care. Depression and anxiety disorders occurring in the first year assessed by a clinical psychologist at structured interview using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) at 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months. One hundred and one women were randomised to the intervention group and 98 to the control group. Fifty-four mothers (27%) in the trial were diagnosed with minor or major depression in the 12 months following very preterm delivery, 29 (29%) in the intervention group and 25 (26%) in the control group (relative risk 1.1 [95% CI 0.80-1.5]). There were no differences in the time of onset or the duration of the episodes of depression between the groups. Overall, 74 mothers (37%) of the 199 met criteria for a diagnosis of psychological morbidity during the first year. Our intervention program did not alter the prevalence of depression in these mothers. Rates of depression and stress reactions are high in these mothers.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials of a 6-session cognitive-behavioral, midwife-administered intervention in mothers of preterm infants showed no preventive benefit (N=176; RR=1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.20).

Query: Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS?
Document: The immediate post-partum period is stressful for most parents. The need to use a home apnea monitor may tax parental coping skills even further. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess the psychosocial consequences of apnea monitoring on parental emotional distress and family functioning. We studied 104 parents of infants at high risk for cardiopulmonary arrest. Fifty-two parents had infants who used home apnea monitors, and 52 parents were age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. Data were collected during the infant's hospitalization, and then at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after discharge. At 1 year, parents were interviewed about their attitudes toward using the apnea monitor. Both groups experienced elevated levels of emotional distress, but the group with infants who used the monitors had significant increases in depression and hostility immediately following discharge from the hospital compared with baseline, whereas the non-monitored group had a significant increase in hostility at 6 months. At 1-year follow-up, the majority of the parents reported that they used the monitor every night, felt more secure in using it, and judged it helpful. The immediate period following hospital discharge of infants who need to use a home apnea monitor is characterized by significant emotional distress for the parents, which resolves over time. Anticipatory education and counseling of parents is recommended.
Summary:","The psychological costs of home apnea monitoring have been studied. One hundred and four parents of monitored and unmonitored infants were enrolled in a questionnaire study to determine emotional distress and family functioning. As is common among families in the postpartum period, all experienced increased stress. But parents of monitored infants, compared with parents of unmonitored infants, had an increased incidence of subjective depression (number needed to harm [NNH]=7) and hostility (NNH=12) at 2 weeks postpartum. Interestingly, at 1-year follow-up interviews, 83% of parents who had consistently used the monitor reported feeling more secure for having used it and 69% believed that monitor use had been helpful."

Query 1: Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event?
Document 1: In addition to lowering lipid profile, statins have pleiotropic effects on improving vascular function. Changes of these pleiotropic effects and their relationship to lipid profile after withdrawal of statin treatment remained unclear. We investigated the changes of lipid profile and plasma concentrations of human soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and human tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) after withdrawal of statin treatment. Twenty-two patients (14 F, 8 M, aged 63+/-13 years) with hypercholesterolemia were treated with atorvastatin (ATOR; 10 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Blood samplings for serum lipid and markers were collected before, after and withdrawal of statin treatment. The total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and sVCAM-1 (from 394.4+/-251.7 to 321.0+/-198.9 ng/ml, p<0.05) all decreased significantly and the tPA (from 9.47+/-3.57 to 11.62+/-3.99 ng/ml, p<0.05) increased significantly after atorvastatin treatment. During the following 3 days after withdrawal of atorvastatin, the total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol did not show any significant change. However, the plasma sVCAM-1 significantly elevated on day 2 (from 321.0+/-198.9 to 371.2+/-220.4 ng/ml, p<0.05) and the plasma tPA significantly decreased on day 1 (from 11.62+/-3.99 to 10.52+/-3.55 ng/ml, p<0.05) and day 3 (from 11.62+/-3.99 to 10.27+/-3.69 ng/ml, p<0.05). Both the significant elevation of sVCAM-1 and decrease of tPA after withdrawal of atorvastatin treatment occurred within 3 days, while the serum cholesterol and LDL-chol levels did not have any significant change and were still within the therapeutic range. After 12 weeks of atorvastatin treatment, the beneficial pleiotropic effects can be demonstrated simultaneously with lowering the lipid profile. However, after withdrawal of atorvastatin, the beneficial pleiotropic effects are abrogated rapidly within days and are independent on elevation of serum cholesterol.
Summary 1: Tissue plasminogen activator levels are decreased after discontinuation of statins, resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state.

Query 2: Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event?
Document 2: For a variety of reasons, many patients abruptly discontinue statin therapy. The present analysis was conducted to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular outcomes increases after withdrawal of statin therapy in a stable cardiac population. In the Treating to New Target (TNT) study, 2 doses of atorvastatin (10 and 80 mg once daily) are being used in a double-blind parallel-group design. Of the 18,468 patients screened for study participation, 16,619 entered a dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, and of these, 15,432 eligible participants began treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d on an open-label basis. Of the subjects who entered the dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, 57% were receiving prior statin therapy. During the 6-week drug-washout period, there were 24 primary events (defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or nonfatal stroke); throughout the subsequent 8-week open-label period, there were 31 primary events. This equated to monthly Kaplan-Meier event rates of 0.20% during washout and 0.26% in the open-label phase. Event rates were therefore similar during the 2 phases. The present analysis demonstrates that short-term discontinuation of statin therapy in stable cardiac patients apparently does not lead to a clinically important increased risk of acute coronary syndromes.
Summary 2: A post-hoc analysis of the washout period of a prospective study of 9473 asymptomatic outpatients who were previously taking statins showed that for these lower-risk patients, similar rates of cardiovascular events could be expected during withdrawal (any statin) or initiation of atorvastatin therapy. The monthly event rate during the discontinuation phase was 0.20% and during initiation was 0.26% (P=NS)

Query: Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event?
Document: There is increasing interest in the non-lipid-lowering effects of statins and their effect on outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It has been suggested that withdrawal of statin therapy during an acute coronary syndrome may attenuate any benefits of pretreatment, thereby providing indirect evidence of the importance of their non-lipid-lowering effects. This observational study compared the demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 4. Comparison groups consisted of patients previously receiving statins who also received statins within 24 hours of hospital admission (n = 9,001), patients previously using statins in whom therapy was discontinued (n = 4,870), and patients who did not receive statins at any time before or during hospitalization (n = 54,635). Of 13,871 patients receiving statins before hospital admission, 35.1% had treatment withdrawn during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. These patients had increased hospital morbidity and mortality rates relative to patients in whom therapy was continued, with higher rates of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, shock, and death. In multivariate analyses, these patients were at statistically significant increased risk of hospital death compared with those continuing statin therapy and at similar risk compared with those not receiving statins before or during hospitalization. Withdrawal of statin therapy in the first 24 hours of hospitalization for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is associated with worse hospital outcomes. In the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, our findings suggest that statin therapy should be continued during hospitalization for myocardial infarction unless strongly contraindicated.
Summary:","One retrospective case-control study evaluated 4870 patients who had statin therapy withdrawn on admission to the hospital for non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). Patients who had their statins withheld had increased rates of heart failure, arrhythmia, shock, and death (hazard ratio=2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.67)."

Query: Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event?
Document: HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiac event rates in patients with stable coronary heart disease. Withdrawal of chronic statin treatment during acute coronary syndromes may impair vascular function independent of lipid-lowering effects and thus increase cardiac event rate. We investigated the effects of statins on the cardiac event rate in 1616 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management (PRISM) study who had coronary artery disease and chest pain in the previous 24 hours. We recorded death and nonfatal myocardial infarction during the 30-day follow-up. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ among 1249 patients without statin therapy, 379 patients with continued statin therapy, and 86 patients with discontinued statin therapy after hospitalization. Statin therapy was associated with a reduced event rate at 30-day follow-up compared with patients without statins (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86]; P=0.004). If the statin therapy was withdrawn after admission, cardiac risk increased compared with patients who continued to receive statins (2.93 [95% CI, 1.64 to 6.27]; P=0.005) and tended to be higher compared with patients who never received statins (1.69 [95% CI, 0.92 to 3.56]; P=0.15). This was related to an increased event rate during the first week after onset of symptoms and was independent of cholesterol levels. In a multivariate model, troponin T elevation (P=0.005), ST changes (P=0.02), and continuation of statin therapy (P=0.008) were the only independent predictors of patient outcome. Statin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes is associated with improved clinical outcome. However, discontinuation of statins after onset of symptoms completely abrogates this beneficial effect.
Summary:","A post-hoc analysis of data from the PRISM trial found that among the 86 patients who were admitted for chest pain and had their statin withdrawn, a higher rate of death and nonfatal MI was observed, compared with the 379 patients whose statins were continued (hazard ratio=2.93; 95% CI, 1.64-6.27). This effect was seen in the first week and was independent of cholesterol levels and measures of severity of illness."

Query 1: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 1: The efficacy of an integrated, psychological treatment program was tested in a controlled study involving 27 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (fibromyalgia). The experimental treatment program consisted of instruction in various self-help techniques (e.g., cognitive behavioral strategies, relaxation, physical exercises) as well as information on chronic pain. Control groups were instructed only in autogenic training. Measures of pain, daily activities, general symptoms, and psychological functioning were assessed before and after treatment, as well as at 4 months after termination of therapy (follow-up). At the end of treatment, 7 patients from the experimental group and 2 from the control group showed significant clinical improvement in 3 of 6 parameters (NS). At follow-up, the improvement was still present in 5 experimental cases but in none of the controls (p = 0.024). Successful patients had been sick for a shorter period of time and were less impaired by their condition. Psychological interventions in combination with physiotherapy can be effective in treating fibromyalgia patients, especially if applied early.
Summary 1: Keel and colleagues found no immediate treatment benefit following 15 weeks of education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exercise vs relaxation training in their small randomized controlled trial.

Query 2: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 2: To determine the effectiveness of self-management education and physical training in decreasing fibromyalgia (FMS) symptoms and increasing physical and psychological well being. A pretest-posttest control group design was used. Ninety-nine women with FMS were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups; 86 completed the study. The education only group received a 6-week self-management course. The education plus physical training group received the course and 6 h of training designed to assist them to exercise independently. The control group got treatment after 3 months. The experimental programs had a significant positive impact on quality of life and self-efficacy. Helplessness, number of days feeling bad, physical dysfunction, and pain in the tender points decreased significantly in one or both of the treated groups when retested 6 weeks after the end of the program. Longterm followup of 67 treated subjects showed significant positive changes on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire primarily in the physical training group. Among all subjects, 87% were exercising at least 3 times/week for 20 min or more; 46% said they had increased their exercise level since participating in the program; 70% were practicing relaxation strategies as needed; 46% were working at least half time as opposed to 37% at pretest. Self-efficacy of the treated groups was enhanced significantly by the program. Other changes were smaller and more delayed than had been expected. Recommendations for future trials include a longer education program, more vigorous physical training, and longterm followup.
Summary 2: A trial randomized 99 patients to 3 groups: education and cognitive behavioral therapy; education, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise; or a wait-list control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the education group scored significantly higher than the others-but only on self-reported measures of daily functioning and self-efficacy.

Query: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document: To determine the effectiveness of a muscle strengthening program compared to a stretching program in women with fibromyalgia (FM). Sixty-eight women with FM were randomly assigned to a 12 week, twice weekly exercise program consisting of either muscle strengthening or stretching. Outcome measures included muscle strength (main outcome variable), flexibility, weight, body fat, tender point count, and disease and symptom severity scales. No statistically significant differences between groups were found on independent t tests. Paired t tests revealed twice the number of significant improvements in the strengthening group compared to the stretching group. Effect size scores indicated that the magnitude of change was generally greater in the strengthening group than the stretching group. Patients with FM can engage in a specially tailored muscle strengthening program and experience an improvement in overall disease activity, without a significant exercise induced flare in pain. Flexibility training alone also results in overall improvements, albeit of a lesser degree.
Summary:","In a trial of muscle strengthening vs flexibility training, investigators found no difference between groups on measures including tender points and disease and symptom severity. They did find benefits in symptoms and self-efficacy over baseline, but it is not known whether these were sustained."

Query: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document: To evaluate the efficacy of a 6-week exercise and educational program for patients with fibromyalgia. Forty-one subjects were randomly assigned to the program or served as waiting list controls. Program outcome was assessed with a 6-minute walk test, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, a Self-Efficacy Scale, and a ""knowledge"" questionnaire (based on information provided during the educational sessions). Waiting list control subjects subsequently completed the program. Program outcome was reassessed 3 or 6 months post-program. The program produced significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance, well-being, fatigue, self-efficacy (for controlling pain and other symptoms), and knowledge. At followup, immediate gains in walk distance, well-being, and self-efficacy were maintained, but gains in fatigue and knowledge were lost. Short-term exercise and educational programs can produce immediate and sustained benefits for patients with fibromyalgia. The benefits of our program may be due to exercise or education since both interventions were given.
Summary:","In a study, 45 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to a 6-week program combining exercise and multidisciplinary education or to a control group. The treatment group had significant improvements in walking distance and for 2 measures on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (feeling bad and morning fatigue)."

Query: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document: To compare the effectiveness of biofeedback/relaxation, exercise, and a combined program for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Subjects (n = 119) were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: 1) biofeedback/relaxation training, 2) exercise training, 3) a combination treatment, or 4) an educational/attention control program. All 3 treatment groups produced improvements in self-efficacy for function relative to the control condition. In addition, all treatment groups were significantly different from the control group on tender point index scores, reflecting a modest deterioration by the attention control group rather than improvements by the treatment groups. The exercise and combination groups also resulted in modest improvements on a physical activity measure. The combination group best maintained benefits across the 2-year period. This study demonstrates that these 3 treatment interventions result in improved self-efficacy for physical function which was best maintained by the combination group.
Summary:","In the highest-quality trial, Buckelew and colleagues randomized 119 subjects to 1 of 4 groups: biofeedback and relaxation training, exercise training, combination treatment, and an education and attention control program. Individuals were evaluated on measures of pain, function, disease impact, and self-efficacy. Evaluators were blinded to treatment group. Patients were followed for 2 years, and follow-up information was available on 85% of patients. At immediate postintervention follow-up, all treatment groups were significantly improved on tender-point index score compared with the control group, but this was due to a modest deterioration for the control group rather than improvements in the treatment groups. In addition, all groups showed improvements in self-efficacy for function compared with the control group but not for other self-efficacy measures. While within-group improvements in the treatment groups were seen, no significant differences were seen from the control group."

Query 1: What are the repercussions of disclosing a medical error?
Document 1: Mandatory disclosure of medical errors has been advocated to improve patient safety. Many resist mandatory disclosure policies because of concerns about increasing malpractice exposure. It has been countered that malpractice liability actually decreases when there is full disclosure of medical errors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to determine what is known about the impact of full disclosure on malpractice liability. Electronic searches of multiple databases were supplemented with hand searches of bibliographies and communication with recognized experts in the field. Screening the titles, abstracts, and, in many cases, the full articles from more than an estimated 5,200 citations resulted in identification of one published study directly examining malpractice liability when a policy of full disclosure was implemented. Despite extensive literature on the impact of disclosure on malpractice liability, few well-designed studies have focused on the real-world impact on the volume and cost of suits following implementation of a full disclosure policy. Many articles examine why patients sue their doctors, suggesting that some lawsuits may be averted by disclosure, but the articles do not allow us to estimate the additional suits that would be created by disclosure. Additional studies addressing the effect of disclosure on malpractice liability are needed.
Summary 1: Very little evidence exists regarding the effect of disclosure on the likelihood of legal action in actual practice.
##
Query 2: How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention?
Document 2: Informed refusal is a fundamental component of the informed consent process. Informed consent laws have evolved to the ""materiality or patient viewpoint"" standard. A physician must disclose to the patient the risks, benefits, and alternatives that a reasonable person in the patient's position would want to know to make an informed decision. Throughout this process, the patient's autonomy, level of health literacy, and cultural background should be respected. The subsequent election by the patient to forgo an intervention that has been recommended by the physician constitutes informed refusal. Documentation of the informed refusal process is essential. It should include a notation that the need for the intervention, as well as risks, benefits, and alternatives to the intervention, and possible consequences of refusal, have been explained. The patient's reason for refusal also should be documented.
Summary 2: The general standard of disclosure has evolved to what an ordinary, reasonable patient would wish to know.

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document 1: To derive a highly sensitive decision rule for the selective use of radiography in acute knee injuries. Prospectively administered survey. Emergency departments of two university hospitals. Convenience sample of 1,047 adults with acute knee injuries. Attending emergency physicians assessed each patient for 23 standardized clinical findings, which were recorded on data collection forms. A total of 127 patients was examined independently by two physicians to determine interobserver agreement. The outcome measure was fracture of the knee. Any patients who did not have ED radiography underwent a structured telephone interview to determine the possibility of a missed fracture. Those variables found to be both reliable (highest kappa values) and strongly associated with a fracture (highest chi 2 values) were further analyzed by a recursive-partitioning multivariate technique. The derived decision rule included the following variables: (1) age 55 years or older, (2) tenderness at the head of the fibula, (3) isolated tenderness of the patella, (4) inability to flex to 90 degrees, and (5) inability to bear weight both immediately and in the ED (four steps). The presence of one or more of these findings would have identified the 68 fractures in the study population with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval [Cl], .95 to 1.0) and a specificity of .54 (95% Cl, .51 to .57). Application of the rule would have led to a 28.0% relative reduction in the use of radiography from 68.6% to 49.4% in the study population. A practical, highly sensitive, and reliable decision rule for the use of radiography in acute knee injuries has been derived. Clinical application should await prospective validation of the rule.
Summary 1: The Ottawa Knee Rules recommend knee x-rays for any patient meeting one of these criteria: 1) ≥55 years of age. 2) Tenderness over the head of the fibula or isolated to the patella without other bony tenderness. 3) Unable to flex the knee to 90º, or unable to bear weight (for at least 4 steps) both immediately and in the emergency department.

Document 2: The Ottawa knee rule is a clinical decision aid that helps rule out fractures and avoid unnecessary radiography. To summarize evidence about the accuracy of the Ottawa knee rule. Relevant English- and non-English-language articles were identified from PreMEDLINE and MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), BIOSIS (1990-2003), the Cochrane Library (2002, Issue 3), the Science Citation Index database, reference lists of included studies, and experts. Articles were included if they reported enough information to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Ottawa knee rule for detecting fractures confirmed either radiologically or in combination with follow-up. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study samples, the ways that the Ottawa knee rule was used, and methodologic characteristics of studies. Of 11 identified studies, 6 involving 4249 adult patients were considered appropriate for pooled analysis. The pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23), the pooled sensitivity was 98.5% (CI, 93.2% to 100%), and the pooled specificity was 48.6% (CI, 43.4% to 51.0%). A negative result on an Ottawa knee rule test accurately excluded knee fractures after acute knee injury. However, because the rule is calibrated toward 100% sensitivity and actual fracture prevalences are usually low, large-scale, multicentered studies are still needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of routinely implementing the rule.
Summary 2: In a systematic review, the Ottawa rules had a pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.23).

Query: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document: Previous studies have shown that the application of the Ottawa knee rule (OKR) reduces the need for radiographs in adults with acute knee injuries. Our objectives were to describe the epidemiology and incidence of knee injuries in children with acute knee trauma and to validate the OKR in a pediatric population. A prospective, consecutive study. Two urban pediatric emergency departments. All children 18 years of age and under who presented with acute traumatic knee injury of less than 1 week's duration, excluding patients with a normal knee examination, superficial skin injuries, prior history of knee injury, underlying bone disease, serious injuries involving two or more organ systems, or altered mental status were enrolled. Physicians assessed each patient for 22 standardized clinical findings prior to radiography. The OKR was applied to each patient by the investigating physician. All 234 patients eligible for the study had radiographs of the affected knee. The median age was 13 years with a range of 2 to 18 years. Using the OKR criteria for obtaining knee radiographs, 12 of 13 patients with fractures were identified (sensitivity 92%; 95% CI= 64-99). The missed case was an 8-year-old male who had sustained a nondisplaced fracture of the proximal tibia after a fall. If the OKR were applied to the pediatric population, it would have reduced the need for radiography in 46% of children. In the pediatric population studied, the OKR did not identify all patients with knee fractures. Future studies may consider modifying the OKR to accommodate the differences between pediatric and adult patients to improve the sensitivity of the rule while maintaining its specificity, before it can be applied routinely in clinical practice.
Summary:","A prospective study of the Ottawa rules among children with acute knee injury demonstrated a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.47-2.21) and an LR- of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.02-1.04). However, limited information is available in the pediatric population."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document 1: To define the accuracy (compared with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of sonographic examination in detecting knee effusion and to determine whether the presence of knee effusions in patients with traumatic knee injury can predict knee internal derangement as assessed by MRI. Prospective study. Hospital rehabilitation department. Thirty patients (19 men, 11 women) with traumatic knee injury were recruited. Subjects received sonographic examination and MRI on the same day. Not applicable. The presence or absence of knee effusion was assessed by sonographic examination. MRI was used as criterion standard to evaluate whether the presence of knee effusion and internal derangement, which included tear of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, as well as meniscus tear. The sensitivity of sonographic examination for detecting knee effusion was 79.1%, and specificity was 50%. The positive-predictive value (PPV) was 86.3% and negative-predictive value (NPV) was 37.5%. The PPV of sonographic effusion to internal derangement was 90.9%, and the NPV was 37.5%. Sonographic examination can accurately detect effusion of the knee. The detection of knee effusion in patients with traumatic knee injury by sonographic examination is highly indicative of internal knee derangement.
Summary 1: In a small nonrandomized study of adult knee trauma, sonographic diagnosis of an effusion (by an expert) had an LR+ for diagnosing an internal derangement of the knee of 2.0 (95% CI, 0.67-5.96) and an LR- of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.12-0.96), as compared with the gold standard of MRI.

Document 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee in identifying traumatic intraarticular knee lesions. 300 patients with a clinical diagnosis of traumatic intraarticular knee lesions underwent prearthoscopic magnetic resonance imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio for a positive test, likelihood ratio for a negative test, and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging were calculated relative to the findings during arthroscopy in the studied structures of the knee (medial meniscus, lateral meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and articular cartilage). Magnetic resonance imaging produced the following results regarding detection of lesions: medial meniscus: sensitivity 97.5%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value 93.9%, positive negative value 97%, likelihood positive ratio 13.7, likelihood negative ratio 0.02, and accuracy 95.3%; lateral meniscus: sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 93.6%, positive predictive value 92.7%, positive negative value 92.9%, likelihood positive ratio 14.3, likelihood negative ratio 0.08, and accuracy 93.6%; anterior cruciate ligament: sensitivity 99.0%, specificity 95.9%, positive predictive value 91.9%, positive negative value 99.5%, likelihood positive ratio 21.5, likelihood negative ratio 0.01, and accuracy 96.6%; posterior cruciate ligament: sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 80.0%, positive negative value 100%, likelihood positive ratio 100, likelihood negative ratio 0.01, and accuracy 99.6%; articular cartilage: sensitivity 76.1%, specificity 94.9%, positive predictive value 94.7%, positive negative value 76.9%, likelihood positive ratio 14.9, likelihood negative ratio 0.25, and accuracy 84.6%. Magnetic resonance imaging is a satisfactory diagnostic tool for evaluating meniscal and ligamentous lesions of the knee, but it is unable to clearly identify articular cartilage lesions.
Summary 2: In a nonrandomized prospective study of adults receiving magnetic resonance imaging of the knee prior to arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging identified meniscal and ligamentous lesions of the knee satisfactorily.

Query: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document: A report in the orthopedics literature states that MR imaging for internal derangement of the knee has a lower accuracy in adolescents than in adults and may even provide spurious information that alters clinical management. This assertion has not been specifically addressed in the radiology literature. The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of MR imaging in adolescents with regard to injury of the cruciate ligaments and menisci. A database search of our institution's records from January 1998 to July 2000 yielded 2140 MR examinations of the knee, all of which had been performed with a standard knee protocol on a 1.5-T magnet. Of these 2140 examinations, 156 included patients younger than 18 years. Fifty-nine of these patients underwent surgery, and the orthopedic surgeons' operative reports were used as the gold standard with which the MR imaging results were compared. Thirty-four boys and 25 girls who ranged in age from 11 to 17 years (mean age, 15 years) were examined. The clinical notes for the remaining 97 patients were evaluated for information about management and clinical improvement. The sensitivity and specificity values for MR imaging of the menisci and cruciate ligaments in adolescents were as follows: medial meniscus, 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity; lateral meniscus, 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity; anterior cruciate ligament, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity; and posterior cruciate ligament, 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Our data suggest that MR imaging of the knee in adolescents is sensitive, specific, and accurate.
Summary:","In a retrospective study of adolescents (11 to 17 years of age) having knee MRIs and undergoing knee surgery, MRI compared favorably with the operative (gold standard) diagnosis."

Query 1: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document 1: Adjusted-dose warfarin is highly efficacious for prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this treatment carries a risk of bleeding and the need for frequent medical monitoring. We sought an alternative that would be safer and easier to administer to patients with AF who are at high-risk of thromboembolism. 1044 patients with AF and with at least one thromboembolic risk factor (congestive heart failure or left ventricular fractional shortening < or = 25%, previous thromboembolism, systolic blood pressure of more than 160 mm Hg at study enrollment, or being a woman aged over 75 years) were randomly assigned either a combination of low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin (international normalised ratio [INR] 1.2-1.5 for initial dose adjustment) and aspirin (325 mg/day) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Drugs were given open-labelled. The mean INR during follow-up of patients taking combination therapy (n = 521) was 1.3, compared with 2.4 for those taking adjusted-dose warfarin (n = 523). During follow-up, 54% of INRs in patients taking combination therapy were 1.2-1.5 and 34% were less than 1.2. The trial was stopped after a mean, follow-up of 1.1 years when the rate of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events) in patients given combination therapy (7.9% per year) was significantly higher than in those given adjusted-dose warfarin (1.9% per year) at an interim analysis (p < 0.0001), an absolute reduction of 6.0% per year (95% Cl 3.4, 8.6) by adjusted-dose warfarin. The annual rates of disabling stroke (5.6% vs 1.7%, p = 0.0007) and of primary event or vascular death (11.8% vs 6.4%, p = 0.002), were also higher with combination therapy. The rates of major bleeding were similar in both treatment groups. Low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in this regimen is insufficient for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF at high-risk for thromboembolism; adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) importantly reduces stroke for high-risk patients.
Summary 1: The stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation III investigators further compared adjusted-dose warfarin with low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in high-risk patients with NVAF. An interim analysis at 1.1 years revealed superiority in the reduction of ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms with adjusted-dose warfarin 7.9% vs 1.9% per year, respectively; NNT=16, which led to the trial's termination. Rates of major hemorrhage did not differ between treatment groups 2.4% per year with combination vs 2.1% per year with warfarin.

Query 2: Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients?
Document 2: Warfarin is very effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism but is also associated with a substantial risk of bleeding. After three months of conventional warfarin therapy, a lower dose of anticoagulant medication may result in less bleeding and still prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study, in which 738 patients who had completed three or more months of warfarin therapy for unprovoked venous thromboembolism were randomly assigned to continue warfarin therapy with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 (conventional intensity) or a target INR of 1.5 to 1.9 (low intensity). Patients were followed for an average of 2.4 years. Of 369 patients assigned to low-intensity therapy, 16 had recurrent venous thromboembolism (1.9 per 100 person-years), as compared with 6 of 369 assigned to conventional-intensity therapy (0.7 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.0). A major bleeding episode occurred in nine patients assigned to low-intensity therapy (1.1 events per 100 person-years) and eight patients assigned to conventional-intensity therapy (0.9 event per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 3.0). There was no significant difference in the frequency of overall bleeding between the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.1). Conventional-intensity warfarin therapy is more effective than low-intensity warfarin therapy for the long-term prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The low-intensity warfarin regimen does not reduce the risk of clinically important bleeding.
Summary 2: A double-blind randomized controlled trial of 738 patients demonstrated that conventional-intensity warfarin therapy INR=2.0-3.0 was more effective than low-intensity therapy INR=1.5-1.9 in prevention of recurrent DVT. There were 1.9 vs 0.7 DVTs per 100 person-years in the low-intensity vs conventional-intensity therapy groups hazard ratio=2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.0; number needed to treat [NNT]=37. No significant difference was seen in the frequency of bleeding complications between the groups. This and other studies suggest that low-intensity warfarin therapy reduces the relative risk of thrombosis by about 75%, and conventional-intensity therapy reduces this risk by over 90%.

Query: Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients?
Document: Patients undergoing rehabilitation after thromboembolic stroke have a relatively high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Warfarin, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 is effective for the prevention of VTE. However, because stroke is a major risk factor for bleeding with warfarin, a less intense regimen (target INR < 2.0), might safely prevent VTE in stroke rehabilitation patients. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 mg of warfarin in patients undergoing rehabilitation following completed stroke. The major efficacy endpoint was symptomatic, objectively proven VTE or asymptomatic VTE detected by monthly duplex ultrasonography (DU) of the proximal leg veins or mandatory bilateral contrast venography performed at the end of the study. The major safety endpoint was bleeding. There were 475 patients screened for enrollment, 355 had one or more exclusion criterion, and 17 had previously undetected proximal DVT on admission. Of the 103 eligible and consenting patients, 56 received warfarin and 47 received placebo. Of the randomized patients, 88 had successful venography (47 warfarin and 41 placebo). In the warfarin group, three (8%) patients had DVT and one (2%) had proximal DVT whereas in the placebo group, seven (20%) had DVT and five (13%) had proximal DVT. The risk ratio for any DVT in warfarin-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients was 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-1.37). For proximal DVT, the risk ratio was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.01-1.4). No patients suffered major bleeding. A fixed dose of 2 mg of warfarin per day in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation is safe and associated with a relative risk reduction of about 80% in the incidence of proximal DVT and 60% in overall DVT.
Summary:","A few small studies suggest that warfarin reduces DVT rates in spinal-cord-injured patients. A small trial randomized stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation to placebo or fixed 1- or 2-mg doses of warfarin. This underpowered study showed a nonsignificant decrease in the risk of development of DVT RR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.13-1.37."

Query 1: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 1: The purpose of this study, which involved two dermatology clinics and two podiatric medical clinics, was to determine whether a difference exists in patient-reported satisfaction and compliance between continuous terbinafine therapy and pulse-dose itraconazole therapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Patients in this multicenter, open-label, cross-sectional study had previously completed treatment with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Patients were interviewed by telephone to assess clinical outcomes, compliance, and satisfaction with treatment; clinical data were collected by medical chart review. Patients reported significantly greater ease and convenience of treatment and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine therapy compared with pulse-dose itraconazole therapy.
Summary 1: Terbinafine is well-tolerated by most patients. A telephone survey after treatment with daily terbinafine or pulse-dose itraconazole reported greater ease and convenience, and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine vs pulse-dose itraconazole.

Query 2: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 2: Toenail onychomycosis is a challenge for clinicians to treat, and this challenge is compounded by conflicting information in the medical literature concerning the efficacy of the two principal agents used in its treatment: terbinafine and itraconazole. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of terbinafinewith that of itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. A Medline search was performed for all English language publications from 1966 to June 1999 on the use of terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Included were randomized studies in which subjects received no less than 3 months (or cycles) and no more than 4 months (or cycles) of either terbinafine or itraconazole. Data were abstracted and statistical analyses (random effects model, fixed effects model, and Peto's method) were applied. Thirteen studies were included from the original literature review of 1636 total referenced reports; four studies did not fulfill our inclusion or exclusion criteria. The primary analysis of six studies directly comparing terbinafine to itraconazole resulted in an odds ratio ranging from 1.8 (95% CI = 1.8, 2.8) to 2.9 (1.9, 4.1). The secondary analysis of three studies comparing either itraconazole or terbinafine to placebo estimated an odds ratio of 1.1-1.7. The former shows that terbinafine is 80%-190% more likely to result in mycologic cure than is itraconazole; the latter demonstrates a 10%-70% greater likelihood. The difference between the relative efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Meta-analysis of the published worldwide literature finds that terbinafine is significantly more effective than itraconazole at achieving mycologic cure of toenail onychomycosis.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 6 studies comparing terbinafine with itraconazole reported odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8) to 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.1), indicating an 80% to 190% increased likelihood of clinical cure with terbinafine compared with itraconazole.

Query: What is the most effective treatment for tinea pedis athlete's foot?
Document: In this randomized double-blind trial, two new antifungal compounds were compared in patients with interdigital or more extensive forms of tinea pedis. Two weeks of oral treatment with either terbinafine, an allylamine and new chemical entity, 250 mg daily, or itraconazole 100 mg daily, was given to 366 patients (184 terbinafine, 182 itraconazole). Of 13 patients who did not return after the first visit, 11 were lost to follow-up (five on terbinafine, six on itraconazole) and two reported adverse events. Another nine patients (three on terbinafine and six on itraconazole) were excluded because it was uncertain to which group they were randomized. A central laboratory performed both the mycology and safety tests. In 355 patients who received the study medications and were available for analysis of side-effects, 18 out of 179 (10.0%) in the terbinafine group and 10 out of 176 (5.7%) in the itraconazole group reported adverse events. No new clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were seen after treatment. At week 8 the efficacy analysis in 117 patients with mycologically confirmed dermatophyte infections (51 on terbinafine, 66 on itraconazole) showed that clinical symptoms were absent or minimal in 94.1% of the terbinafine and 72.7% of the itraconazole group (P = 0.0095); mycology was negative in 86.3% of the terbinafine and 54.5% of the itraconazole group (P = 0.0002). With terbinafine, negative mycology at week 8 was 81.3% in the interdigital and 88.6% in the more extensive forms of tinea pedis; with itraconazole mycology was negative in 65.0% and 50.0% of patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary:","In a large double-blind multicenter study of all forms of tinea pedis, De Keyser et al compared 2 weeks of terbinafine at 250 mg/day to 2 weeks of itraconazole at 100 mg/day. After 8 weeks they found terbinafine superior to itraconazole for clinical cure (94.1% vs 72.4%). In a single multicenter open study the cure rate for fluconazole 150 mg was 77% when used once weekly for 3 weeks."

Query 1: Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety?
Document 1: To evaluate the effects of tablet splitting on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol values in patients taking simvastatin and atorvastatin. A retrospective chart review of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values of patients instructed to split simvastatin or atorvastatin between January 1999 and November 2000. Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Huntington, WV. Patients were included if they were taking simvastatin or atorvastatin with regular lipid management and follow-up laboratory results. Patients were required to remain on the same milligram-per-day dose at least 6-8 weeks before and after tablet-splitting initiation and have cholesterol values drawn at least 6 weeks after initiation of both whole-tablet and half-tablet dosing. Patients were excluded if they had a triglyceride level > 400 mg/dL or were noncompliant on the basis of pharmacy records and provider notes. MEASUREMENT OUTCOMES: The primary end points were changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values before and after the patient was switched to half-tablet therapy. The overall results for this review demonstrated no statistically significant increase in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values actually decreased from presplitting to postsplitting, p = 0.017 and p = 0.003, respectively. The investigation showed that half-tablet dosing was as effective as whole-tablet dosing. The program will be continued as a part of quality patient care at the Huntington Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
Summary 1: A retrospective evaluation of 109 patients with split atorvastatin or simvastatin found no significant difference in total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein values after initiating the tablet-splitting program.

Query 2: Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety?
Document 2: The efficacy, safety, and economics of a voluntary conversion from whole simvastatin tablets to split tablets in 6 Veterans Affairs medical centers were retrospectively evaluated in 3,787 patients who received a consistent daily dose (5 to 40 mg) of simvastatin in 1999. Baseline and final low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and average change from baseline were not significantly different between groups (p >0.05), nor were the incidence of transaminase increases (p >0.05) or measurements of patient compliance (p = 0.07). Widespread implementation of this initiative resulted in a cost avoidance of >$1.2 million in the 6 medical centers and $10.3 million across the Veterans Affairs medical system in 1999, with >$46 million avoided in 2003.
Summary 2: A retrospective study of simvastatin evaluated 1098 patients taking whole tablets and 1098 patients converted to split tablets of the same dose. There was no difference in average final low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (111±30 mg/dL vs 112±32 mg/dL) or mean ala-nine aminotransferase (ALT) level.

Query: Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety?
Document: The primary objective was to determine the effect of a hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase inhibitor (HMG) tablet-splitting program on laboratory outcomes (lipid panel and liver enzyme tests). Other objectives were to assess patient compliance and satisfaction with splitting tablets and to measure the reduction in drug acquisition costs. Patients at a Veterans Affairs Health Care System facility were included in this study if they participated in the HMG tablet-splitting program between April and September 2000. Patients taking the same drug and dosage before and after implementation of the program were asked to complete a mailed questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction and compliance with the program. Data collected through electronic charts included patient demographics, prescribed medication, and the values for lipid panel and liver function tests. A total of 2,019 patients were included in the study. The total cost avoidance achieved over one year for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin was 138,108 dollars (N=2,019). The majority of patients who responded to the questionnaire were satisfied and compliant with tablet splitting. In the laboratory analysis (N=512), there was no difference between prevalues and postvalues for total cholesterol and triglycerides. There was a statistically, but not clinically, significant decrease in LDL (102 versus 97, P<0.001) and increase in HDL (46 versus 48, P<0.001), AST (26 versus 28, P<0.001), and ALT (24 versus 26, P=0.006) after the initiation of tablet splitting. Tablet splitting of HMGs had no short-term negative effects on laboratory outcomes and favorable effects on humanistic outcomes as measured by patient satisfaction and compliance. Tablet splitting of HMGs is an effective way to reduce costs and nearly double the number of patients who can be treated for the same expense.
Summary:","A retrospective study evaluated tablet-splitting by 512 patients taking statins atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin. Cholesterol values after 12 or more weeks on a stable whole-tablet dose were compared with those 6 to 52 weeks after initiating tablet-splitting; no significant change was seen in total cholesterol or triglycerides. There was a statistically significant decrease in LDL (102±28 vs 97±29 mg/dL, P<.001), an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (46±12 vs 48±12 mg/dL, P<.001), and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (26±8 vs 28±10 units/L, P<.001), which was attributed to higher medication dosage from accidental ingestion of whole tablets and to diet and lifestyle modifications."

Query 1: What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain?
Document 1: Several randomized trials have suggested recently that epidural steroid injections may not be a valid treatment in common low back pain and sciatica. To clarify this issue, we conducted a critical appraisal of relevant randomized trials published up to 1997. Attention was directed to methodological quality, results, and clinical implications. A Medline search identified 13 trials published between 1966 and 1997. Trial methodology was evaluated using a 100-point grid based on four groups of items, namely study population, therapeutic intervention, evaluation method, and data presentation and analysis. Methodology quality scores ranged from 12 to 84 and were unrelated to the results of epidural steroid therapy. Five trials demonstrated greater pain relief within the first month in the steroid group as compared to the control group. Eight trials found no measurable benefits. Obstacles to meaningful comparisons across studies included differences in the patient populations, steroid used, volume injected, and number of injections. None of the published studies used the injection modalities that are standard practice in France. Whether epidural steroids are effective in common low back pain and sciatica cannot be determined based on our review.
Summary 1: No consistent conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of epidural steroid injections for acute low back pain. This analysis was limited by the inclusion of all studies of patients with acute low back pain regardless of the underlying etiology and presence or absence of radicular symptoms.

Query 2: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document 2: Clinical criteria to select patients with headache in whom structural diagnostic studies (computed tomography) have a high yield disclosing intracranial pathologic findings, independent of abnormal findings on neurologic examination, have not been defined. To determine which clinical characteristics predict the presence of intracranial pathologic findings, independently of neurologic examination, in patients with headache. Case-control, consecutive sample. Major metropolitan trauma center emergency department. Hospital records of 139 hospitalized and 329 randomly selected patients from 1720 nonhospitalized adult patients, consecutively evaluated for headache in the emergency department, were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the headache, results of neurologic and physical examinations, and diagnostic radiologic and laboratory results were correlated with final diagnosis and outcome at 6 months after emergency department visit. Nonparametric statistical analysis. Intracranial pathologic findings were found in 18 (3.8%) of 468 patients. Acute onset and occipitonuchal location of headache, presence of associated symptoms, and patient age of 55 years or older were significantly associated with the finding of intracranial pathology, independently of the findings from neurologic examination. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination alone, whether focal or nonfocal, had a highly significant association and a positive predictive value for intracranial pathology of 39%. Abnormal results from neurologic examination are the best clinical parameters to predict structural intracranial pathology; however, in patients 55 years or older with headache of acute onset located in the occipitonuchal region that has associated symptoms, computed tomographic scan of the head is justified as part of their clinical evaluation independently of the findings of the neurologic examination.
Summary 2: A case-control study reviewed hospital records of 468 patients evaluated in the emergency department for nontraumatic headache. Neuroimaging (CT scan or cerebral angiogram) was performed for 160 of these patients. Final diagnosis and outcome was obtained at 6 months. The symptoms and their ability to predict intracranial pathology are as follows: abnormal neurologic examination (sensitivity=39%; LR+=19.5), location of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=4.87), age of patient (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), multiple associated symptoms (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), mode of onset of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=2.23), and presence of associated symptoms (sensitivity=89%; LR+=1.41). Again, abnormal neurologic examination was the most significant indicator for imaging. This study did not define associated symptoms nor did it specify what determined which patients were imaged.

Query: Is MRI useful for evaluation of acute low back pain?
Document: The relation between abnormalities in the lumbar spine and low back pain is controversial. We examined the prevalence of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar spine in people without back pain. We performed MRI examinations on 98 asymptomatic people. The scans were read independently by two neuroradiologists who did not know the clinical status of the subjects. To reduce the possibility of bias in interpreting the studies, abnormal MRI scans from 27 people with back pain were mixed randomly with the scans from the asymptomatic people. We used the following standardized terms to classify the five intervertebral disks in the lumbosacral spine: normal, bulge (circumferential symmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), protrusion (focal or asymmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), and extrusion (more extreme extension of the disk beyond the interspace). Nonintervertebral disk abnormalities, such as facet arthropathy, were also documented. Thirty-six percent of the 98 asymptomatic subjects had normal disks at all levels. With the results of the two readings averaged, 52 percent of the subjects had a bulge at at least one level, 27 percent had a protrusion, and 1 percent had an extrusion. Thirty-eight percent had an abnormality of more than one intervertebral disk. The prevalence of bulges, but not of protrusions, increased with age. The most common nonintervertebral disk abnormalities were Schmorl's nodes (herniation of the disk into the vertebral-body end plate), found in 19 percent of the subjects; annular defects (disruption of the outer fibrous ring of the disk), in 14 percent; and facet arthropathy (degenerative disease of the posterior articular processes of the vertebrae), in 8 percent. The findings were similar in men and women. On MRI examination of the lumbar spine, many people without back pain have disk bulges or protrusions but not extrusions. Given the high prevalence of these findings and of back pain, the discovery by MRI of bulges or protrusions in people with low back pain may frequently be coincidental.
Summary:","The lower specificity of MRI for radiculopathy means that MRI can detect disk herniations that do not cause the patient's signs or symptoms. In one study, MRI demonstrated herniated disks in 25% of asymptomatic persons."

Query 1: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 1: Giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis are prevalent in many parts of the world. Application of a single drug for treatment of both giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis is highly desirable. One hundred children of both sexes, ranging from 7 to 12 years old with Giardia intestinalis cysts or trophozoites in their stool samples, were randomly separated into two groups of 50 individuals each. Each group received either mebendazole tablets 200 mg thrice daily for 5 days or metronidazole tablet 15 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, for 7 days. The results were evaluated by microscopic examination of stools on two successive occasions: 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment. Each occasion consisted of three stool examination on 3 successive days. The cure rate of mebendazole-treated children was 43 out of 50 (86 per cent), and for metronidazole it was 45 out of 50 (90 per cent) with no statistical difference between the two groups. No side-effects were observed in the mebendazole-treated group, whereas nausea, anorexia and metallic taste were observed in 4.9, 6 and 24 per cent of metronidazole-treated children, respectively. In conclusion, the use of mebendazole, which is less toxic with no side-effects, is available and effective on Giardia intestinalis as well as intestinal nematodes, is recommended especially in the areas where giardiasis and intestinal nematodiasis are prevalent and overlap.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials comparing 5 days of mebendazole with 7 days of metronidazole in 7- to 12-year-old Iranian children showed no statistical difference in microbiologic cure between the 2 regimens.

Query 2: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 2: There can be a high rate of recurrence of disease after initial drug treatment for giardiasis. These drugs also have a range of adverse effects. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of drug treatments for giardiasis. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, Current Contents, reference lists of articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of drug therapy for giardiasis compared with placebo or another drug. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Thirty-four trials were included. Only one trial was without serious methodological flaws. Compared with placebo, drug treatment was associated with an improved cure rate (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 58). Metronidazole treatment longer than three days had a better parasitological cure rate than other long treatment courses (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. Single dose therapy appeared equally effective as longer treatment courses (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.34). Within the single dose regimens, tinidazole had a comparable parasitological cure rate to other short therapies (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 12), but had a higher clinical cure rate (odds ratio 5.3, 95% 2.7-10.7). A single dose of tinidazole appears to give the highest clinical cure rate for giardiasis with relatively few adverse effects.
Summary 2: A 2006 Cochrane Review compared 34 trials of many drug therapies for giardiasis. The review, which is being updated to include additional publications, evaluated both head-to-head and placebo-controlled studies, looking at dosage as well as length of drug therapy. The review found that a single dose of tinidazole had a higher clinical cure rate than other therapies such as metronidazole (odds ratio [OR]=5.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.66-10.67) along with a comparable side-effect profile. These findings favor tinidazole as the treatment of choice for symptomatic giardiasis.

Query: What is the best portable method of purifying water to prevent infectious disease?
Document: The ability to control water-borne diseases is critical for soldiers, hikers, and others who may need to drink directly from an outdoor source. Water-borne protozoan parasites that are specifically of concern are Giardia and Cryptosporidium because of their resistance to halogen disinfection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of iodine tablets against Giardia and Cryptosporidium under general- and worst-case water conditions that might be found in the field. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were exposed to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions (two tablets/L = 13-18 mg/L for 20 minutes). This dose inactivated 3-log10 of Giardia in general-case water and pH 9. In worst-case water, however, only about 35% of cysts were inactivated at pH 5. Fifty minutes were required to achieve a 3-log10 reduction at pH 5. Cryptosporidium oocysts were more difficult to inactivate. Only 10% were inactivated after a 20-minute exposure to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions; even after 240 minutes of exposure to iodine only 66-81% oocysts were inactivated. These data strongly suggest that iodine disinfection is not effective in inactivating Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Because this organism is common in all surface waters, it is recommended that another method of treatment be used before ingestion.
Summary:","Halogenation does not reduce Cryptosporidium below the microbiological hazard of 99.9%, but it is generally accepted to effectively treat viruses, bacteria, and other protozoa after filtering through a cloth to remove large particles."

Query 1: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document 1: Clinicians recognize the importance of monitoring aberrant medication-related behaviors of chronic pain patients while being prescribed opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) for those pain patients already on long-term opioid therapy. An initial pool of 177 items was developed with input from 26 pain management and addiction specialists. Concept mapping identified six primary concepts underlying medication misuse, which were used to develop an initial item pool. Twenty-two pain and addiction specialists rated the items on importance and relevance, resulting in selection of a 40-item alpha COMM. Final item selection was based on empirical evaluation of items with patients taking opioids for chronic, noncancer pain (N=227). One-week test-retest reliability was examined with 55 participants. All participants were administered the alpha version of the COMM, the Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) interview, and submitted a urine sample for toxicology screening. Physician ratings of patient aberrant behaviors were also obtained. Of the 40 items, 17 items appeared to adequately measure aberrant behavior, demonstrating excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Cutoff scores were examined using ROC curve analysis and reasonable sensitivity and specificity were established. To evaluate the COMM's ability to capture change in patient status, it was tested on a subset of patients (N=86) that were followed and reassessed three months later. The COMM was found to have promise as a brief, self-report measure of current aberrant drug-related behavior. Further cross-validation and replication of these preliminary results is pending.
Summary 1: The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is used to monitor aberrant behaviors in patients on opioid therapy. Scoring for the 17-item, self-administered test is similar to the SOAPP-R. In a study of 86 patients at a multidisciplinary pain center, a score of ≥9 detected opioid misuse with an LR- of 0.08 and an LR+ of 3.48, at a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 66%.

Query 2: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document 2: The original Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP) is a conceptually derived self-report questionnaire designed to predict aberrant medication-related behaviors among chronic pain patients considered for long-term opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an empirically derived version of the SOAPP (SOAPP-R) that addresses some limitations of the original SOAPP. In successive steps, items were reduced from an initial pool of 142 to a 97-item beta version. The beta version was administered to 283 chronic pain patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. Items were evaluated based on data collected at follow-up, including correlation with the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index (ADBI), derived from interview data, physician ratings, and urine toxicology screens. Twenty-four items were retained and comprise the final SOAPP-R. Coefficient alpha was .88, and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of .81 (P < .001). A cutoff score of 18 showed adequate sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.68). The obtained psychometrics, along with the use of a predictive criterion that goes beyond self-report, suggest that the SOAPP-R is an improvement over the original version in screening risk potential for aberrant medication-related behavior among persons with chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: There is a need for a screener for abuse risk in patients prescribed opioids for pain. This study presents a revised version of the SOAPP-R that is empirically derived with good reliability and validity but is less susceptible to overt deception than the original SOAPP version 1.
Summary 2: The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP-R) is a 24-item, self-administered questionnaire that stratifies patients being considered for opioid therapy into lower or higher risk for future opioid-related aberrant behaviors. Each item queries frequency of behaviors and emotions consistent with opioid misuse and can be scored as 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The items on the SOAPP-R were developed by a consensus panel of pain and addiction experts. In a multidisciplinary pain center study, the SOAPP-R was administered to 283 chronic pain patients who were followed for 5 months. At a cutoff score of ≥18, the test had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.80 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.29 for detecting opioid misuse. At this cutoff, the SOAPP-R was 81% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting patients at high risk for aberrant behavior.

Query: What is the addiction risk associated with tramadol?
Document: To assess the drug dependence and abuse liability of tramadol. Subjects of opiate addicts with history of tramadol abuse were 219. Physical dependence of tramadol was assessed using opiate withdrawal scale (OWS), psychic dependence was assessed by association test of Addiction Research Center Inventory-Chinese Version (ARCI-CV); the degrees of craving experienced for tramadol was self-reported on visual analogue scale (VAS). The scores of OWS of tramadol were 0.05-1.07; 3 scores on scales in particular being used the identify euphoric effects--MBG, sedative effects--PCAG, and psychotomimetic effects--LSD of ARCI were 7.3, 6.1, and 3.4, respectively (F = 38.1, P < 0.01); 57.1% of tramadol abuse subjects had craving for tramadol (chi 2 = 75.86, P < 0.01). Tramadol produced high abuse potential among opiate addicts.
Summary:","Another prospective study assessed the subjective tramadol withdrawal experience in 219 patients with a diagnosis of ""Tramadol misuse"" who were attending 6 drug detoxification centers in China. Validated drug dependence symptom scales found that while the degree of physical dependence reported was uniformly mild, the majority of patients reported the psychic dependence symptom of tramadol craving."

Query 1: How should a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan be used to evaluate bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis?
Document 1: Antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. We report the results of a multinational randomized, double-blind study, in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated with alendronate for up to 10 years. The initial three-year phase of the study compared three daily doses of alendronate with placebo. Women in the original placebo group received alendronate in years 4 and 5 and then were discharged. Women in the original active-treatment groups continued to receive alendronate during the initial extension (years 4 and 5). In two further extensions (years 6 and 7, and 8 through 10), women who had received 5 mg or 10 mg of alendronate daily continued on the same treatment. Women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. Randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. We report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study. Treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit. The therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in the gradual loss of its effects.
Summary 1: Alendronate continues to increase BMD: following 10 years of treatment, it increased bone mineral density by 13.7% in the lumbar spine, 6.7% in the total hip, and 5.4 % in the femoral neck.

Query 2: Should we screen women for hypothyroidism?
Document 2: Osteoporosis is the main cause of spine and hip fractures. Morbidity, mortality, and costs arising from hip fractures have been well documented. Thyroid hormones (TH) are widely prescribed, mainly in the elderly. Some studies (but not all) found a deleterious effect of suppressive TH therapy on bone mass. These conflicting data raised a controversy as to the safety of current prescribing and follow-up habits, which, in turn, raised major health-care issues. To look for a detrimental effect on bone of TH therapy, we performed a meta-analysis (by pooling standardized differences, using a fixed effect model) of all published controlled cross-sectional studies (41, including about 1250 patients) concerning the impact of TH therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Studies with women receiving estrogen therapy were excluded a priori, as were studies with a high percentage of patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism, when no separate data were available. We decided to stratify the data according to anatomical site, menopausal status, and suppressive or replacement TH therapy, resulting in 25 meta-analysis on 138 homogeneous subsets of data. The main sources of heterogensity between studies that we could identify were replacement or suppressive TH therapy, menopausal status, site (lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, greater trochanter, midshaft and distal radius, with various percentages of cortical bone), and history of hyperthyroidism, which has recently been found to impair bone mass in a large epidemiological survey. To improve homogeneity, we excluded a posteriori 102 patients from 3 studies, who had a past history of hyperthyroidism and separate BMD data, thus allowing assessment of the TH effect in almost all 25 subset meta-analyses. However, controls were usually not matched with cases for many factors influencing bone mass, such as body weight, age at menarche and at menopause, calcium dietary intake, smoking habits, alcohol intake, exercise, etc. For lumbar spine and hip (as for all other sites), suppressive TH therapy was associated with significant bone loss in postmenopausal women (but not in premenopausal women), whereas, conversely, replacement therapy was associated with bone loss in premenopausal women (spine and hip), but not in postmenopausal women. The detrimental effect of TH appeared more marked on cortical bone than on trabecular bone. Only a large long term prospective placebo-controlled trial of TH therapy (e.g. in benign nodules) evaluating BMD (and ideally fracture rate) would provide further insight into these issues.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 41 controlled, cross-sectional studies involving 1250 women treated with thyroid replacement for all causes (ie, not specifically subclinical hypothyroidism) found that replacement therapy (mean duration of treatment, 7 to 9 years) was associated with bone loss in premenopausal women, but not in postmenopausal women.

Query: How should a DEXA scan be used to evaluate bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis?
Document: The ability of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) has been well documented in epidemiologic and pharmaceutical trials. However, its application to monitoring of patients in clinical practice has been subject to recent controversies. Despite these controversies, most clinical centers rely on DXA for monitoring of patients, and therefore guidance is needed. In this article, we report the positions developed by an expert panel of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry on the use of densitometry for the serial measurement of bone mass for monitoring change in BMD. The panel found DXA to be a precise method of measuring change in BMD if used with an appropriate level of least significant change (LSC), at anatomic sites with good precision and response to therapy, and at 1- to 2-yr time intervals. Monitoring is acceptable for determining when therapy is indicated, and if an agent is not therapeutically effective (i.e., when bone loss occurs despite treatment). Each densitometry center should perform an in vivo precision study on individuals similar to the patient population at the center and determine LSC at a 95% confidence level. If such a precision study cannot be performed, benchmark precision might be used, although there was no agreement on what values should be used. The PA spine is the preferred anatomic site for monitoring. The total hip can be used when the spine study is technically invalid. We conclude with recommendations for further research.
Summary:","In summary, limitations in DEXA precision mean any changes in BMD of less than 5.6% at the femoral neck may be due to measurement error, and BMD response to bisphosphonates vacillates in the first few years of use but can be expected to increase femoral neck BMD 3% to 6% over 3 years. Therefore, if serial DEXA scanning is preformed on patients prescribed bisphosphonate therapy, it should be considered no earlier than 2 to 3 years after therapy begins. When monitoring osteoporosis therapy, a BMD change within the LSC should be interpreted as ""no change"" and should not lead to changes in patient management. If the BMD has decreased beyond the LSC there is cause for concern and reevaluation of diagnosis and treatment are warranted."

Query 1: Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke?
Document 1: To determine the effectiveness of a cotinine-feedback, behaviorally based education intervention in reducing environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and health-care utilization of children with asthma. Randomized controlled trial of educational intervention vs usual care. The pediatric pulmonary service of a regional pediatric hospital. ETS-exposed, Medicaid/Medi-Cal-eligible, predominantly minority children who were 3 to 12 years old and who were seen for asthma in the hospital's emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services departments (n = 87). Three nurse-led sessions employing behavior-changing strategies and basic asthma education and that incorporated repeated feedback on the child's urinary cotinine level. The primary measurements were the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR) and the number of acute asthma medical visits. The secondary measurements were number of hospitalizations, smoking restrictions in home, amount smoked, reported exposures of children, and asthma control. The intervention was associated with a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) for more than one acute asthma medical visit in the follow-up year, after adjusting for baseline visits (total visits, 87; OR, 0.32; p = 0.03), and a comparably sized but nonsignificant OR for one or more hospitalization (OR, 0.34; p = 0.14). The follow-up CCR measurement and the determination of whether smoking was prohibited inside the home strongly favored the intervention group (n = 51) (mean difference in CCR adjusted for baseline, -0.38; p = 0.26; n = 51) (60; OR [for proportion of subjects prohibiting smoking], 0.24; p = 0.11; n = 60). This intervention significantly reduced asthma health-care utilization in ETS-exposed, low-income, minority children. Effects sizes for urine cotinine and proportion prohibiting smoking were moderate to large but not statistically significant, possibly the result of reduced precision due to the loss of patients to active follow-up. Improving ETS reduction interventions and understanding their mechanism of action on asthma outcomes requires further controlled trials that measure ETS exposure and behavioral and disease outcomes concurrently.
Summary 1: A 2001 trial randomized 81 families with a smoking parent and an asthmatic child between 3 and 12 years of age to 3 sessions of behavioral and educational counseling or usual care at an outpatient asthma clinic. Parental education included information on second-hand smoke, basic asthma education, and feedback about urine cotinine levels (a marker of nicotine absorption). Behavioral counseling focused on reducing second-hand smoke exposure by caregivers. The education group had a significantly reduced risk of 2 or more asthma-related clinic visits in the following 12 months compared with usual care (odds ratio=0.32; P=.03; number needed to treat=5). No significant decrease was noted in mean urine cotinine levels between groups (adjusted mean difference=-0.38 ng/mg favoring education; P=.26).

Query 2: Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke?
Document 2: To examine the long-term maintenance of a previously reported behavioral counseling intervention to reduce asthmatic children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Families of asthmatic children (6 to 17 years), including at least one parent who smoked in the home, recruited from four pediatric allergy clinics. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: behavioral counseling to reduce ETS exposure, self-monitoring control, and usual medical care control. Counseling concluded at month 6, and the original trial ended at month 12. Two follow-up interviews occurred at months 20 and 30. The originally reported analysis of baseline to 12 months was reanalyzed with a more robust restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The 2-year follow-up period was analyzed similarly. Significantly greater change occurred in the counseling group than the control groups and was sustained throughout the 2 years of follow-up. Further exploratory analyses suggested that printed counseling materials given to all participants at month 12 (conclusion of the original study) were associated with decreased exposure in the control groups. Such long-term maintenance of behavior change is highly unusual in the general behavioral science literature, let alone for addictive behaviors. We conclude that ETS exposure can be reduced and that a clinician-delivered treatment may provide substantial benefit.
Summary 2: A trial that measured changes in urine cotinine randomized 91 families with a smoking parent and an asthmatic child into 3 groups: A control group received usual care (regular office visits at an asthma clinic and medication management); A monitoring group used a parental smoking diary and a children's asthma symptom diary; And a counseling group received 5 counseling sessions and also kept diaries. An environmental monitor in the home was used to assess exposure to secondhand smoke. In the counseling group, 21.4% of patients (6 of 28) maintained 0% exposure throughout the 30-month trial period compared with 3.6% and 3.8% in the monitoring and control groups, respectively (P<.05 for comparison of counseling group to monitoring and control).

Query 1: How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis?
Document 1: To determine whether intranasal corticosteroids are superior to oral H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing intranasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamines. Randomised controlled trials conducted worldwide and published between 1966 and 1997. 2267 subjects with allergic rhinitis in 16 randomised controlled trials. Nasal blockage, nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal itch, postnasal drip, nasal discomfort, total nasal symptoms, nasal resistance, and eye symptoms and global ratings. Outcomes measured on different scales were combined to determine pooled odds ratios (categorical outcomes) or standardised mean differences (continuous outcomes). Assessment of heterogeneity between studies, and subgroup analyses of eye symptoms, were undertaken. Intranasal corticosteroids produced significantly greater relief than oral antihistamines of nasal blockage (standardised mean difference 0.63, 95% confidence interval - 0.73 to - 0.53), nasal discharge (-0.5, - 0.6 to - 0.4), sneezing (- 0.49, - 0.59 to - 0.39), nasal itch (- 0.38,- 0.49 to - 0.21), postnasal drip (- 0.24,- 0.42 to - 0.06), and total nasal symptoms (- 0.42,- 0.53 to - 0.32), and global ratings gave an odds ratio for deterioration of symptoms of 0.26 (0.08 to 0.8). There were no significant differences between treatments for nasal discomfort, nasal resistance, or eye symptoms. The effects on sneezing, total nasal symptoms, and eye symptoms were significantly heterogeneous between studies. Other combined outcomes were homogeneous between studies. Subgroup analysis of the outcome of eye symptoms suggested that the duration of assessment (averaged mean score over the study period versus mean score at end of study period) might have accounted for the heterogeneity. The results of this systematic review, together with data on safety and cost effectiveness, support the use of intranasal corticosteroids over oral antihistamines as first line treatment for allergic rhinitis.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs compared the efficacy of intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines for alleviating nasal, eye, and global allergy symptoms. Intranasal steroids were superior to oral antihistamines for all patient-oriented nasal symptom and global symptom ratings. Eye symptom scores and adverse events were similar in each treatment group.

Query 2: How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis?
Document 2: The anti-inflammatory activity of corticosteroids has prompted the exploration of their use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The development of intranasal steroids has resulted in several agents with quick actions, localized effects, and great efficacy in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the prophylactic management of perennial rhinitis. This article presents a concise review of the preclinical and clinical evidence with these new agents and provides data-based guidance for the selection of optimal agents. The survey reveals that mometasone furoate, a new inhaled steroid with topical activity, has the greatest binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by fluticasone propionate, budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, and dexamethasone. Mometasone furoate also has strong anti-inflammatory activity, with IL-4 and IL-5 inhibition activities equivalent to those of fluticasone propionate. Clinically, both mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate appear to be well tolerated, to have quick onsets of action, and to be equivalent in efficacy in the treatment of seasonal allergic and perennial rhinitis. Of the intranasal steroids currently available, mometasone furoate has been shown to have the least systemic availability and, consequently, is expected to have the fewest systemic side effects. Some suppression of overnight cortisol levels has been reported with fluticasone propionate (indicative of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression).
Summary 2: The newer nasal steroids such as fluticasone may be more effective because of their stronger affinities to glucocorticoid receptors, but no clinical evidence confirms this hypothesis.

Query: Do nasal decongestants relieve symptoms?
Document: The aims of the study were to determine: 1) how mucociliary activity in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is affected; 2) how this activity is changed by therapy; 3) the effects of topical agents on mucociliary clearance, and 4) the most appropriate topical agent(s) to be used in the therapy of sinusitis. Five groups of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis were studied prospectively. All patients had 500 mg oral amoxicillin and 125 mg oral clavulanic acid preparations given three times daily for 3 weeks. According to the topical agent applications, these groups included: group I (n = 12), no topical treatment was given; group II (n = 14), two puffs for each nostril once daily of 50 microg/100 mL fluticasone propionate was given; group III (n = 9), one puff for each nostril three times daily of 0.05% oxymetazoline was given; group IV (n =12), 3% sodium chloride (NaCl) (buffered to pH 6.5-7 at room temperature) was given; and group V (n =13), 10-mL solutions of 0.9% NaCl (buffered to pH 6.5--7 at room temperature) were given for nasal irrigations three times daily. All patients had medication for 3 weeks and were controlled each week. The saccharin method was used to measure nasal mucociliary clearance. To investigate the early effects of the topical agents for groups II to V, an additional test was repeated 20 minutes after the basal mucociliary clearance recordings. The test was repeated in the first, second, and third weeks of the treatment. The mucociliary clearance was significantly slower in the acute bacterial rhinosinusitis group than in the control group. There was no significant difference between the basal mucociliary clearance and the 20th minute mucociliary clearance of the fluticasone propionate and 0.9% NaCl solution groups. The mean values of the basal and the 20 minute's mucociliary clearance of the oxymetazoline group were 24.72 +/- 6.16 and 15.5 +/- 7.45 minutes, respectively, which were statistically significant. The mean values of the basal and the 20th minute mucociliary clearance of the 3% NaCl solution groups were 19.45 +/- 9.35 and 15.45 +/- 8.20 minutes, respectively, which were also statistically significant. In the first group (without topical treatment), the basal mucociliary clearance became significantly shorter after the second week of treatment. In the first and second weeks of the treatment of the oxymetazoline group, the mucociliary clearance did not change significantly, but after the third week the mucociliary clearance was significantly shorter. In the 3% NaCl solution group, significant improvement began from the first week and continued through the third week. Comparing the basal and the third weeks' mucociliary clearance values among the groups, the oxymetazoline and 3% NaCl solution groups revealed more significant improvement than the other groups, but this improvement was not different from the improvement of group I. There was still a statistically significant difference in the mucociliary clearance of the post-treatment sinusitis groups from the control group. The oxymetazoline and 3% NaCl solution groups seemed to be more effective in mucociliary clearance, but there was no significant difference in improvement among the groups. The improvement of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis takes more than 3 weeks, according to the mucociliary clearance values of the groups.
Summary:","One placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect on mucociliary clearance from adding nasal saline, nasal steroids, or oxymetazoline to antibiotics in acute bacterial sinusitis. The group using oxymetazoline increased mucociliary clearance immediately (within 20 minutes). However, at 3 weeks, the improvement in mucociliary clearance in the oxymetazoline group was not significantly different than in the other groups."

Query 1: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 1: The efficacy and safety of salmeterol alone was compared with the combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium and with placebo during long-term treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, the single-dose effect in response to the first dose of treatment was studied over 12 h. The patients (n=144; age 64+/-7 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 44+/-11% pred) participated in a three-centre double-blind double-placebo parallel group study and were randomized after a run-in period of 2 weeks to receive either salmeterol 50 microg b.i.d., salmeterol 5 microg b.i.d. plus ipratropium 40 microg q.i.d. or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The single-dose study demonstrated that salmeterol produced a significant increase in FEV1 (peak of 7% pred) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) (maximum of 60% baseline) for > or =12 h. The combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium elicited a greater bronchodilator response (11% and 94% increases respectively) than salmeterol alone during the first 6 h after inhalation. During treatment there were significant improvements in daytime symptom scores and morning peak expiratory flow in both the salmeterol and the salmeterol plus ipratropium groups (p<0.001), with an associated decrease in the use of rescue salbutamol. Improvements in FEV1 and sGaw were greater in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group than in the patients receiving only salmeterol. Thirty-five patients had an exacerbation; 11 (23%) in the salmeterol group (versus placebo NS), six (13%) in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group (versus placebo p<0.01) and 18 (36%) in the placebo group. In conclusion, in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term treatment with either salmeterol alone or salmeterol plus ipratropium is safe and effective. There was added benefit from the combination therapy in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol.
Summary 1: A 12-week double-blind, double-placebo-controlled parallel group study published in 2000 followed 144 patients (age 64 ± 7 years with a FEV1of 44 ±11% predicted) randomized to receive salmeterol 50 µg twice daily alone, salmeterol 50 µg twice daily plus ipratropium 40 µg 4 times daily, or placebo. Patients were assessed for changes in FEV1, daytime symptom scores, specific airway conductance, and the need for rescue medication. The study demonstrated a significant benefit from the addition of ipratropium to salmeterol in terms of reduction of airway obstruction, but not in symptom control or need for rescue medication. However, no patients were randomized to receive ipratropium alone, so comparison of the relative contribution of the 2 classes is limited.

Query 2: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 2: Inhaled bronchodilators form the mainstay of treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. Two types of agent are used routinely, either singly or in combination: anticholinergic agents and beta2-sympathomimetic agonists. To assess the effect of anti-cholinergic agents on lung function and dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, compared with placebo or short-acting beta-2 agonists. A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD Trials Register, using the terms: bronchodilator* OR ipratropium OR oxitropium. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Studies were included if the participants were adult patients with a known diagnosis of COPD and had symptoms consistent with criteria for acute exacerbation of COPD. All randomized controlled trials that compared inhaled ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide to appropriate controls were considered. Appropriate control treatments included placebo, other bronchodilating agents, or combination therapies. Studies of acute asthma or ventilated patients were excluded. All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. Four trials compared the short-term effects of ipratropium bromide vs. a beta2-agonist. Short-term changes in FEV1 (up to 90 minutes) showed no significant difference between beta2-agonist and ipratropium bromide treated patients. The differences were similar among the studies and when combined: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.0 liters (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) -0.19, 0.19). There was no significant additional increase in change in FEV1 on adding ipratropium to beta2-agonist: WMD 0.02 liter (95% CI -0.08, 0.12). Long-term effects (24 hours) of the ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist treatment combination were similar: WMD 0.05 liters (95%CI -0.14, 0.05). Neither of two studies found significant changes in PaO2, either short- or long-term, with ipratropium vs. beta-agonist, although one showed an increase in PaO2 in subjects receiving ipratropium bromide at 60 minutes. Adverse drug reactions included dry mouth and tremor. There was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation achieved with ipratropium bromide was greater than that using a short-acting beta2-agonist. The combination of a beta2-agonist and ipratropium did not appear to increase the effect on FEV1 more than either used alone.
Summary 2: A recent Cochrane Review comparing the short-term effects of ipratropium to β2-agonists in changes in FEV1and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) concluded there was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation from ipratropium was greater than that from short-acting β2-agonists. Subjective endpoints such as dyspnea and quality of life were not assessed, and neither of the above reviews included studies focusing on long-term outcomes.

Query: Do nasal decongestants relieve symptoms?
Document: The efficacy of a new administration form of oxymetazoline, a nasal bellows container, was investigated in two separate studies by means of a combined treatment with phenoxymethyl-penicillin for acute maxillary sinusitis. In the first study (study 1), oxymetazoline administered with a bellows (OXBE) was compared both with a placebo belows (PLBE) as well as with oxymetazoline and placebo administered with a conventional nasal spray (OXSP respective PLSP) in 73 patients. In the second study (study 2), OXBE was compared only with PLBE in 48 patients. Objective evaluation was made by comparing the radiographical improvement in conventional plain sinus X-ray images. A scoring system corresponding to the outcome of antral irrigation was used for evaluating the X-ray pictures. Subjective symptoms; nasal stuffiness and pain, were assessed by registrations on visual analogue scales. Neither with regard to radiographical improvement nor to decrease in subjective symptoms could any significant differences be found between the different treatment modes. Oxymetazoline administered with a nasal bellows thus did not accelerate the rate of healing of acute maxillary sinusitis in these two studies. It is inferred from these results that decongestion of the sinus ostia is not of primary importance for the course of healing of a manifest acute sinusitis.
Summary:","A prospective, placebo-controlled study evaluated improvement in x-ray findings as well as subjective symptoms in acute sinusitis using phenoxymethyl-penicillin (penicillin V) in combination with oxymetazoline or placebo administered via a variety of nasal delivery systems. Oxymetazoline was not significantly different from placebo. Controlled prospective studies are lacking to support the use of decongestants in acute sinusitis."

Query 1: Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure?
Document 1: Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure are associated with increased rates of overall mortality and sudden death. Amiodarone is now used widely to prevent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conducted a trial to determine whether amiodarone can reduce overall mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 674 patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement, 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients). The primary end point was overall mortality, and the median follow-up was 45 months (range, 0 to 54). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups (P = 0.6). The two-year actuarial survival rate was 69.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 64.2 to 74.6) for the patients in the amiodarone group and 70.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 65.7 to 75.9) for those in the placebo group. At two years, the rate of sudden death was 15 percent in the amiodarone group and 19 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.43). There was a trend toward a reduction in overall mortality among the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received amiodarone (P = 0.07). Amiodarone was significantly more effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction by 42 percent at two years. Although amiodarone was effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and improving ventricular function, it did not reduce the incidence of sudden death or prolong survival among patients with heart failure, except for a trend toward reduced mortality among those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Summary 1: The largest placebo-controlled trial in heart failure failed to detect a significant decrease in sudden death.

Query 2: Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure?
Document 2: The role of cardiac glycosides in treating patients with chronic heart failure and normal sinus rhythm remains controversial. We studied the effect of digoxin on mortality and hospitalization in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. In the main trial, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.45 or less were randomly assigned to digoxin (3397 patients) or placebo (3403 patients) in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (median dose of digoxin, 0.25 mg per day; average follow-up, 37 months). In an ancillary trial of patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.45, 492 patients were randomly assigned to digoxin and 496 to placebo. In the main trial, mortality was unaffected. There were 1181 deaths (34.8 percent) with digoxin and 1194 deaths (35.1 percent) with placebo (risk ratio when digoxin was compared with placebo, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.07; P=0.80). In the digoxin group, there was a trend toward a decrease in the risk of death attributed to worsening heart failure (risk ratio, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.01; P=0.06). There were 6 percent fewer hospitalizations overall in that group than in the placebo group, and fewer patients were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (26.8 percent vs. 34.7 percent; risk ratio, 0.72; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.79; P<0.001). In the ancillary trial, the findings regarding the primary combined outcome of death or hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were consistent with the results of the main trial. Digoxin did not reduce overall mortality, but it reduced the rate of hospitalization both overall and for worsening heart failure. These findings define more precisely the role of digoxin in the management of chronic heart failure.
Summary 2: Increased rates of supraventricular dysrhythmias (RR=2.08; 95% CI, 1.44-2.99; number needed to harm [NNH]=77) and second- and third-degree heart block were demonstrated for patients receiving digoxin (RR=2.93; 95% CI, 1.61-5.34; NNH=125).

Query: Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure?
Document: In severe heart failure many deaths are sudden and are presumed to be due to ventricular arrhythmias. The GESICA trial evaluated the effect of low-dose amiodarone on two-year mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Our prospective multicentre trial included 516 patients on optimal standard treatment for heart failure. Patients were randomised to 300 mg/day amiodarone (260) or to standard treatment (256). Intention-to-treat analysis showed 87 deaths in the amiodarone group (33.5%) compared with 106 in the control group (41.4%) (risk reduction 28%; 95% CI 4%-45%; log rank test p = 0.024). There were reductions in both sudden death (risk reduction 27%; p = 0.16) and death due to progressive heart failure (risk reduction 23%; p = 0.16). Fewer patients in the amiodarone group died or were admitted to hospital due to worsening heart failure (119 versus 149 in the control group; risk reduction 31%; 95% CI 13-46%; p = 0.0024). The decrease in mortality and hospital admission was present in all subgroups examined and independent of the presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Side-effects were reported in 17 patients (6.1%); amiodarone was withdrawn in 12. Low-dose amiodarone proved to be an effective and reliable treatment, reducing mortality and hospital admission in patients with severe heart failure independently of the presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias.
Summary:","A randomized controlled trial in heart failure showed a significant ARR of 2.9% for sudden death, but was unblinded."

Query 1: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document 1: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.
Summary 1: nicotine replacement therapy reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by partially replacing nicotine in the blood. Abstinence rates are superior to placebo based on a Cochrane review (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.66-1.88; NNT=20; 95% CI, 17-23).

Query 2: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document 2: There are at least two theoretical reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Alternatively, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways underlying nicotine addiction, (e.g. blocking nicotine receptors) independent of their antidepressant effects. The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long-term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in September 2006. We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smoking cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow up. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the pharmacotherapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. Seventeen new trials were identified since the last update in 2004 bringing the total number of included trials to 53. There were 40 trials of bupropion and eight trials of nortriptyline. When used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion (31 trials, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72 to 2.19) and nortriptyline (four trials, OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.41) both doubled the odds of cessation. There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion or nortriptyline to nicotine replacement therapy provides an additional long-term benefit. Three trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation did not find evidence of a significant long-term benefit. From the available data bupropion and nortriptyline appear to be equally effective and of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement therapy. Pooling three trials comparing bupropion to varenicline showed a lower odds of quitting with bupropion (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78). There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Concerns that bupropion may increase suicide risk are currently unproven. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side-effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation. There were six trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; four of fluoxetine, one of sertraline and one of paroxetine. None of these detected significant long-term effects, and there was no evidence of a significant benefit when results were pooled. There was one trial of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor moclobemide, and one of the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine. Neither of these detected a significant long-term benefit. The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Adverse events with both medications are rarely serious or lead to stopping medication.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review assessing the efficacy of antidepressants for smoking cessation showed that, when used as monotherapy, bupropion (31 trials; OR=1.94; 95% CI, 1.72-2.19) and nortriptyline (4 trials; OR=2.34; 95% CI, 1.61-3.41) both doubled the odds of smoking cessation.

Query: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document: Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials have now been published or are currently underway. The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The latest search was in September 2010. We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and nicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment. We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up.The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to produce a risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. We found 11 trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these included a bupropion experimental arm. We also found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo, and two open-label trials comparing varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We also include one trial in which all the participants were given varenicline, but received behavioural support either online or by phone calls, or by both methods. This trial is not included in the analyses, but contributes to the data on safety and tolerability. The included studies covered >10,300 participants, 6892 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion.The pooled risk ratio (RR) (10 trials, 4443 people, excluding one trial evaluating long term safety) for continuous abstinence at six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 2.66). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be effective, with an RR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 trials, 1272 people). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year was 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.88; 3 trials, 1622 people). The RR for varenicline versus NRT for point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 2 trials, 778 people). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Post-marketing safety data raised questions about a possible association between varenicline and depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling of varenicline was amended in 2008, and the manufacturers produced a Medication Guide. Thus far, surveillance reports and secondary analyses of trial data lend little support to a causal relationship.The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08). Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts, have been reported but are so far not substantiated.There is a need for further independent community-based trials of varenicline, to test its efficacy and safety in smokers with varying co-morbidities and risk patterns. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of treatment extended beyond 12 weeks. Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.
Summary:","Varenicline, a partial agonist at the Α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, aids smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms. A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that varenicline resulted in significantly greater continuous abstinence at 12 months than placebo (OR=3.22; 95% CI, 2.43-4.27; NNT=8; 95% CI, 5-11)."

Query 1: Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression?
Document 1: To test whether a cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program reduces the prevalence of depression during the first postnatal year in mothers of very preterm babies. Prospective, single blind, randomised, controlled study. Perinatal centre in Western Australia. One hundred and ninety-nine out of 673 English-speaking mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal unit. A six-session cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program provided by a research midwife between weeks two and six after birth. Women in the control group received standard care. Depression and anxiety disorders occurring in the first year assessed by a clinical psychologist at structured interview using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) at 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months. One hundred and one women were randomised to the intervention group and 98 to the control group. Fifty-four mothers (27%) in the trial were diagnosed with minor or major depression in the 12 months following very preterm delivery, 29 (29%) in the intervention group and 25 (26%) in the control group (relative risk 1.1 [95% CI 0.80-1.5]). There were no differences in the time of onset or the duration of the episodes of depression between the groups. Overall, 74 mothers (37%) of the 199 met criteria for a diagnosis of psychological morbidity during the first year. Our intervention program did not alter the prevalence of depression in these mothers. Rates of depression and stress reactions are high in these mothers.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials of a 6-session cognitive-behavioral, midwife-administered intervention in mothers of preterm infants showed no preventive benefit (N=176; RR=1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.20).

Query 2: Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers?
Document 2: to study the effect of birth centre care on the duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications, and women's experiences of breast feeding. randomised controlled trial. in-hospital birth centre at South Hospital, Stockholm, and standard obstetric care in the Greater Stockholm area. 1230 women with expected date of birth between October 1989 and February 1992, interested in participating in a birth centre trial, and meeting medical low-risk criteria. 617 women were allocated to the experimental group offered birth centre care (EG), and 613 to the control group offered standard obstetric care (CG). duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications such as sore nipples, engorgement, milk stasis, and mastitis, and women's experiences of breast feeding. no difference was found between EG and CG in the duration of breast feeding. Ninety-three per cent in both groups were breast feeding exclusively two months post partum. The average number of months of breast feeding, exclusively or partly, when investigated one year after the birth was 8.6 in EG and 8.5 in CG. No difference was observed in women's experiences of breast feeding, but rather more women in EG than in CG reported sore nipples, 36% and 30% respectively (p = 0.03), and milk stasis, 26% and 19% respectively (p = 0.002). birth centre care had no effect on the duration of breast feeding, or on women's experiences of breast feeding. Prenatal attitudes were probably more significant predictors of these outcomes than differences in the two modes of maternity care in this population of highly breast feeding-motivated women. The larger proportion of sore nipples and milk stasis in the EG might have been due to earlier discharge, or to midwives less skilled in assisting with breast feeding at the birth centre than in the postpartum wards.
Summary 2: In another randomized controlled trials performed in Sweden, women who received peripartum care in a birthing center had more nipple pain than women who delivered in a traditional hospital setting (NNT=16).

Query: Does antepartum perineal massage reduce intrapartum lacerations?
Document: To study the effects of antenatal perineal massage on subsequent perineal outcomes at delivery. A randomised, single-blind prospective study. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Watford General Hospital. Eight hundred and sixty-one nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy and fulfilling criteria for entry to the trial between June 1994 and October 1995. Comparison of the group assigned to massage with the group assigned to no massage showed a reduction of 6.1% in second or third degree tears or episiotomies. This corresponded to tear rates of 75.1% in the no-massage group and 69.0% in the massage group (P = 0.073). There was a corresponding reduction in instrumental deliveries from 40.9% to 34.6% (P = 0.094). After adjustment for mother's age and infant's birthweight these reductions achieved statistical significance (P = 0.024 and P = 0.034, respectively). Analysis by mother's age showed a much larger benefit due to massage in those aged 30 and over and a smaller benefit in those under 30. Antenatal perineal massage appears to have some benefit in reducing second or third degree tears or episiotomies and instrumental deliveries. This effect was stronger in the age group 30 years and above.
Summary:","Beginning at 34 weeks, women or their partners performed perineal massage for 4 minutes, 3 to 4 times a week. Massage was performed by inserting 1 or 2 fingers 3 to 5 cm into the vagina and sweeping downward and from side to side, using almond oil for lubrication."

Query 1: What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants?
Document 1: Augmentation mammaplasty has become more popular in Taiwan. Therefore, clinical imaging is necessary to evaluate those patients who develop breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detection of breast diseases after augmentation mammaplasty by means of mammography and sonography. A retrospective follow-up study and analysis of diagnostic methods including mammography, sonography, physical examination, and aspiration cytology was conducted on 105 patients who underwent augmentation mammaplasty at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between 1989 and 2001. A total of 105 patients were identified in this study, and mean follow-up was 4 years. Two tumors from 8 cancer patients were visible on standard mammograms, and seven tumors were diagnosed as cancer by sonography. One of 15 benign breast tumors was interpreted as a suspected cancer, and 7 tumors were interpreted as normal findings on mammograms. Fourteen of 15 benign breast tumors were diagnosed correctly except for one suspicious case examined by sonography. Sonography showed the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy (91.3%) and mammograms had the lowest rate (73.9%). The accuracy rate of physical examination was 73.9%, and aspiration cytology was 90.0% accurate. This study affirms that sonography is a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty.
Summary 1: Although studies comparing screening methods have not been performed in the United States, a small Taiwanese study directly compared ultrasound to mammography in 105 women without breast implants. This retrospective cohort study found sonography to be a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women. Sonography had the highest sensitivity (87.5%) compared to physical examination (50.0%) and mammography (25.5%). Sonography was recommended as the imaging tool for Asian women with smaller, denser breasts. However, it is unclear whether this result applies to US women or women who have undergone breast augmentation surgery.

Query 2: When should we stop mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women?
Document 2: Screening mammography is effective in reducing breast cancer mortality in women between the ages of 50 and 69 years. We sought to determine whether older women who undergo screening mammography have a decreased risk of metastatic breast cancer. We studied 690,993 women aged 66 to 79 years who were California Medicare beneficiaries from January 1992 to December 1993, and who chose the fee-for-service plan. Health Care Financing Administration part B billing records were used to determine the use of screening mammography. The extent of breast cancer (in situ, local, regional, or metastatic) was ascertained for the 6,767 women who were diagnosed with the disease in 1993, using data from the California State Cancer Registry. For each type (extent) of breast cancer, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence (CI) of developing breast cancer was estimated by dividing the risk of its development in screened women by the risk in women who were not screened. A total of 46% of women had mammography during the 2-year study period. In situ, local, and regional breast cancer were more likely to be detected among women who underwent screening mammography. For example, the relative risk of detecting local breast cancer in screened women was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.1 to 3.5). The risk of detecting metastatic breast cancer, on the other hand, was significantly reduced among women aged 66 to 79 years who underwent screening mammography (RR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.72). Screening mammography is associated with a decreased risk of detecting metastatic breast cancer among elderly women. Public health recommendations need to weigh the benefit of screening elderly women against the cost and potential harm from screening and treating early lesions that may have no effect on mortality.
Summary 2: A retrospective cohort study studied studied 690,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California and found a 43% reduction in the risk of metastatic breast cancer in the screened group. A 13-year Dutch study found a 20% breast cancer mortality reduction that first appeared 7 years after initiating screening. The cohorts were not randomly assigned in either study, leading to possible differences in baseline risk.

Query: What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants?
Document: It is thought that implants interfere with breast cancer diagnosis and that cancers in women who have had breast augmentation carry a worse prognosis. A prospective breast cancer database was reviewed, comparing augmented and nonaugmented patients for details of histology, palpability, tumor size, nodal status, mammographic status, receptor status, nuclear grade, stage, and outcome. Ninety-nine cancers in augmented women and 2857 cancers in nonaugmented women were identified. Among these women, mammography was normal in 43% of those who had had augmentation and in 5% of those who had not. Augmented women were more likely to have palpable cancers (83% vs. 59%) and nodal involvement (48% vs. 36%), and less likely to have ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (18% vs. 28%). When comparing only women younger than 50, the differences in invasiveness and nodal status lost significance. Cancers diagnosed in the 1990s were more likely to be nonpalpable and noninvasive than those diagnosed in the 1980s. This trend was more pronounced in the augmented population. Augmented patients were more likely to have palpable cancers, although the overall stage and outcome were similar to those of nonaugmented women. Although there have been significant improvements in our ability to diagnose early breast cancer over the past two decades, mammography continues to be suboptimal in augmented women.
Summary:",A study of 2956 cancer patients found that mammography detected an abnormal breast mass in 66.3% of augmented women compared with 94.6% of nonaugmented women (P=.001). No significant differences were noted in cancer characteristics at diagnosis or survival rates (P=.78). The authors of this study concluded that mammography should be used for augmented women until a more effective screening tool is found.

Query 1: What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants?
Document 1: Augmentation mammaplasty has become more popular in Taiwan. Therefore, clinical imaging is necessary to evaluate those patients who develop breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detection of breast diseases after augmentation mammaplasty by means of mammography and sonography. A retrospective follow-up study and analysis of diagnostic methods including mammography, sonography, physical examination, and aspiration cytology was conducted on 105 patients who underwent augmentation mammaplasty at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between 1989 and 2001. A total of 105 patients were identified in this study, and mean follow-up was 4 years. Two tumors from 8 cancer patients were visible on standard mammograms, and seven tumors were diagnosed as cancer by sonography. One of 15 benign breast tumors was interpreted as a suspected cancer, and 7 tumors were interpreted as normal findings on mammograms. Fourteen of 15 benign breast tumors were diagnosed correctly except for one suspicious case examined by sonography. Sonography showed the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy (91.3%) and mammograms had the lowest rate (73.9%). The accuracy rate of physical examination was 73.9%, and aspiration cytology was 90.0% accurate. This study affirms that sonography is a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty.
Summary 1: Although studies comparing screening methods have not been performed in the United States, a small Taiwanese study directly compared ultrasound to mammography in 105 women without breast implants. This retrospective cohort study found sonography to be a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women. Sonography had the highest sensitivity (87.5%) compared to physical examination (50.0%) and mammography (25.5%). Sonography was recommended as the imaging tool for Asian women with smaller, denser breasts. However, it is unclear whether this result applies to US women or women who have undergone breast augmentation surgery.

Query 2: Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer?
Document 2: Screening for breast cancer with mammography in women aged 50 years or more has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, the extent to which mammography contributes to the reduction of mortality in women who also undergo physical examination of the breasts is not known. This study was designed to compare breast cancer mortality following annual screening consisting of two-view mammography and physical examination of the breasts with mortality following annual screening by physical examination only. Breast self-examination was taught to all participants. This trial randomly and individually assigned 39 405 women aged 50-59 years, recruited from January 1980 through March 1985, to one of the study arms. The women were followed by record linkage with the Canadian National Cancer Registry and National Mortality Database to December 31, 1993, and by active follow-up of breast cancer patients to June 30, 1996. Randomization achieved virtually equal distribution of demographic and breast cancer risk variables. At the first annual screen, 21% of the cancers found by mammography alone (in the mammography plus physical examination group) were 20 mm or more in size compared with 46% of those found by physical examination in the mammography plus physical examination group and 56% in the physical examination-only group. The corresponding percentages for screens 2-5 were 10%, 42%, and 50%, respectively. Screening detected 267 invasive breast cancers in the mammography plus physical examination group compared with 148 in the physical examination-only group. By December 31, 1993, 622 invasive and 71 in situ breast carcinomas were ascertained in the mammography plus physical examination group, and 610 and 16 were ascertained in the physical examination-only group. At 13-year follow-up, with 107 and 105 deaths from breast cancer in the respective groups, the cumulative rate ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval = 0.78-1.33). In women aged 50-59 years, the addition of annual mammography screening to physical examination has no impact on breast cancer mortality.
Summary 2: No trials comparing screening clinical breast examinations alone to no screening have been reported, but good indirect evidence of efficacy comes from the results of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 (CNBSS-2). A total of 39,405 women aged 50 to 59 years were randomized to screening with clinical exams plus mammography or clinical exams alone.

Query: What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants?
Document: Recent years have witnessed growing concerns about the possible adverse effects of implants on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Numerous reports describe how implants might interfere with mammography and impair the ability to detect cancer. Several publications document the diminished sensitivity of mammography in augmented patients with palpable tumors. However, epidemiologic studies comparing stage of disease at time of diagnosis in augmented and nonaugmented women are equivocal. The purpose of this study was to review the authors' experience with a large number of breast cancer patients to determine whether implants impair early diagnosis or adversely affect prognosis. The authors reviewed their prospective database, which contains detailed information on 3953 nonaugmented and 129 augmented breast cancer patients. Various parameters of the two groups were compared and differences were analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology. The authors' data reveal that augmented patients present with a statistically greater frequency of palpable lesions, have a slightly greater risk of invasive tumors, and have an increased likelihood of axillary lymph node metastases. Despite this, there was no statistically significant difference in stage of disease between augmented and nonaugmented patients; mean tumor size, recurrence rates, and breast cancer-specific survival were virtually identical in both groups. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that despite the diminished sensitivity of mammography in women with implants, augmented and nonaugmented patients are diagnosed at a similar stage and have a comparable prognosis. While implants may impair mammography, they appear to facilitate detection of palpable breast cancers on physical examination.
Summary:","A 2006 study of 4082 breast cancer patients concluded that mammography yielded a false-negative rate of 41.4% in augmented patients compared with 8.8% in nonaugmented patients (P<.0001). However, both augmented (n=129) and nonaugmented (n=3953) women had a comparable prognosis at diagnosis. The authors of the studies suggested diagnostic mammography for augmented patients and correlation with physical exam findings."

Query: What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants?
Document: Breast augmentation is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer; however, implants may interfere with the detection of breast cancer thereby delaying cancer diagnosis in women with augmentation. To determine whether mammography accuracy and tumor characteristics are different for women with and without augmentation. A prospective cohort of 137 women with augmentation and 685 women without augmentation diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 1995, and October 15, 2002, matched (1:5) by age, race/ethnicity, previous mammography screening, and mammography registry, and 10 533 women with augmentation and 974 915 women without augmentation and without breast cancer among 7 mammography registries in Denver, Colo; Lebanon, NH; Albuquerque, NM; Chapel Hill, NC; San Francisco, Calif; Seattle, Wash; and Burlington, Vt. Comparison between women with and without augmentation of mammography performance measures and cancer characteristics, including invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor stage, nodal status, size, grade, and estrogen-receptor status. Among asymptomatic women, the sensitivity of screening mammography based on the final assessment was lower in women with breast augmentation vs women without (45.0% [95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3%-61.5%] vs 66.8% [95% CI, 60.4%-72.8%]; P =.008), and specificity was slightly higher in women with augmentation (97.7% [95% CI, 97.4%-98.0%] vs 96.7% [95% CI, 96.6%-96.7%]; P<.001). Among symptomatic women, both sensitivity and specificity were lower for women with augmentation compared with women without but these differences were not significant. Tumors were of similar stage, size, estrogen-receptor status, and nodal status but tended to be lower grade (P =.052) for women with breast augmentation vs without. Breast augmentation decreases the sensitivity of screening mammography among asymptomatic women but does not increase the false-positive rate. Despite the lower accuracy of mammography in women with augmentation, the prognostic characteristics of tumors are not influenced by augmentation.
Summary:","A 2004 prospective cohort study of 986,270 women found that, among asymptomatic women diagnosed with breast cancer (40 augmented, 238 nonaugmented), the sensitivity of screening mammograms was lower in women with breast implants (45%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3%-61.5%) than those without (66.8%; 95% CI, 60.4%-72.8%); P=.008). Similarly, in symptomatic women diagnosed with breast cancer (41 augmented, 145 nonaugmented), screening sensitivity was lower in the augmented women (73.2%) than the nonaugmented women (81.4%)-although the results weren't significant (P=.25). Despite lower screening sensitivity, breast tumors in asymptomatic women, whether augmented or not, had similar characteristics, except for larger tumor size (3 mm) at diagnosis in augmented women. Symptomatic women with breast implants had cancers that were smaller, lower-grade, and more likely to be estrogen receptor dependent and invasive (P=.052) compared with nonaugmented women. The authors concluded that augmentation doesn't influence the prognostic characteristics of tumors, and they recommended screening mammography at appropriate intervals."

Query 1: Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment?
Document 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-motor program in patients with early Alzheimer disease (AD) who are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI). Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (12), mild AD (48), and moderate AD (24) (Global Deterioration Scale stages 3, 4, and 5) were randomized to receive psychosocial support plus cognitive-motor intervention (experimental group) or psychosocial support alone (control group). Cognitive-motor intervention (CMI) consisted of a 1-year structured program of 103 sessions of cognitive exercises, plus social and psychomotor activities. The primary efficacy measure was the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Secondary efficacy measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Evaluations were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months by blinded evaluators. Patients in the CMI group maintained cognitive status at month 6, whereas patients in the control group had significantly declined at that time. Cognitive response was higher in the patients with fewer years of formal education. In addition, more patients in the experimental group maintained or improved their affective status at month 12 (experimental group, 75%; control group, 47%; p = 0.017). A long-term CMI in ChEI-treated early Alzheimer disease patients produced additional mood and cognitive benefits.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials of galantamine showed initial cognitive improvement in mild cognitive impairment patients.

Query 2: Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia?
Document 2: Dementia affects an estimated 10% of the population older than 65 years. Because vascular and lipid-related mechanisms are thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, we did an epidemiological study of the potential effect of HMGCoA (3 hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) and other lipid-lowering agents on dementia. We used a nested case-control design with information derived from 368 practices which contribute to the UK-based General Practice Research Database. The base study population included three groups of patients age 50 years and older: all individuals who had received lipid-lowering agents (LLAs); all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of untreated hyperlipidaemia; and a randomly selected group of other individuals. From this base population, all cases with a computer-recorded clinical diagnosis of dementia were identified. Each case was matched with up to four controls derived from the base population on age, sex, practice, and index date of case. The study encompassed 284 cases with dementia and 1080 controls. Among controls 13% had untreated hyperlipidaemia, 11% were prescribed statins, 7% other LLAs, and 69% had no hyperlipidaemia or LLA exposure. The relative risk estimates of dementia adjusted for age, sex, history of coronary-artery disease, hypertension, coronary-bypass surgery and cerebral ischaemia, smoking and body mass index for individuals with untreated hyperlipidaemia (odds ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.45-1.14]), or treated with nonstatin LLAs (0.96 [0.47-1.97], was close to 1.0 and not significant compared with people who had no diagnosis of hyperlipidaemia or exposure to other lipid-lowering drugs. The adjusted relative risk for those prescribed statins was 0.29 (0.13-0.63; p=0.002). Individuals of 50 years and older who were prescribed statins had a substantially lowered risk of developing dementia, independent of the presence or absence of untreated hyperlipidaemia, or exposure to nonstatin LLAs. The available data do not distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
Summary 2: A nested case-control study of 1364 patients found an adjusted relative risk for dementia of 0.29 95% CI, 0.013-0.063; P=.002 among those taking statins. This study did not distinguish between Alzheimer's dementia and other forms of dementia. These studies do not demonstrate a causal relationship between statins and Alzheimer's dementia.

Query: Does treatment with donepezil improve memory for patients with mild cognitive impairment?
Document: Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease. In a double-blind study, we evaluated subjects with the amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2000 IU of vitamin E daily, 10 mg of donepezil daily, or placebo for three years. The primary outcome was clinically possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; secondary outcomes were cognition and function. A total of 769 subjects were enrolled, and possible or probable Alzheimer's disease developed in 212. The overall rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease was 16 percent per year. As compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences in the probability of progression to Alzheimer's disease in the vitamin E group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41; P=0.91) or the donepezil group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.13; P=0.42) during the three years of treatment. Prespecified analyses of the treatment effects at 6-month intervals showed that as compared with the placebo group, the donepezil group had a reduced likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of the study (P=0.04), a finding supported by the secondary outcome measures. Among carriers of one or more apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles, the benefit of donepezil was evident throughout the three-year follow-up. There were no significant differences in the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. Vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Although donepezil therapy was associated with a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of treatment, the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease after three years was not lower among patients treated with donepezil than among those given placebo.
Summary:","The donepezil group had significantly higher rates diarrhea, muscle cramps, insomnia, nausea, and abnormal dreams (P<.01). There was no difference in discontinuation rates between the groups."

Query 1: Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document 1: Additive hemodynamic effects of combined blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II antagonist have been observed in sodium-depleted normotensive volunteers and in patients with congestive heart failure. To investigate whether the same additive hemodynamic effects occur in patients with hypertension and to verify the safety of such an approach. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, pilot study. 177 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 95-115 mmHg after a 4-week placebo run-in period] were included in the study. Combination therapy consisting of 50 mg losartan daily and 10 mg enalapril daily was administered for 6 weeks. The effects of this therapeutic regimen was compared with similar groups of patients who received either 50 mg losartan daily or 10 mg enalapril daily. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP and clinic DBP measured at trough after 6 weeks of treatment. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP did not significantly differ between treatment groups although the combination tended to lower BP more. The combination therapy was more effective on clinic DBP measured at trough than was losartan by 3.2 mmHg [confidence interval (95%, CI) 0.7-5.7 mmHg, P = 0.012], and more effective than enalapril by 4.0 mmHg (95% CI, 1.5-6.4 mmHg, P = 0.002). In a subgroup of 28 patients, higher plasma active renin and angiotensin I levels during blockade by the combination therapy were observed. This finding confirmed that the combination of the two agents inhibited the renin-angiotensin system to a greater extent than did either agent alone. A combination of 10 mg enalapril daily and 50 mg losartan daily safely induces a supplementary, although modest, fall in clinic DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.
Summary 1: One trial of 177 patients found no significant difference in 24-hour ambulatory mean diastolic blood pressure with combination therapy vs angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or ARB monotherapy, but did show a decrease in clinic diastolic blood pressure.

Query 2: How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics?
Document 2: Thirty-five patients with mild hypertension (WHO Class I) participated in a double-blind cross-over study involving two 8-week periods of treatment with cilazapril 2.5-5 mg once daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg once daily, in each case preceded by a 4-week placebo period. Thirty-two patients completed the study, the aim of which was to compare the effects of the drugs on serum electrolyte levels, left ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias, as assessed by echocardiography and 48-h Holter monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.01) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures (comparisons with placebo periods). Cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide had opposite effects on ventricular ectopic activity. The beneficial effect of cilazapril on ventricular extrasystole counts correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with the reduction of left ventricular mass index. Hydrochlorothiazide had no effects on left ventricular mass or diastolic function. Serum potassium values were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by hydrochlorothiazide but there was no correlation between changes in potassium levels and changes in ventricular ectopic activity. The results of the study suggest that hydrochlorothiazide and cilazapril were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, but only cilazapril reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and suppressed ventricular ectopic activity.
Summary 2: Recent studies have found that hydrochlorothiazide in doses above 12.5 to 25 mg do not result in significantly lower blood pressure and only lead to more electrolyte abnormalities.

Query: Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction?
Document: The effect of ibopamine and furosemide in 130 patients with NYHA Class I and II heart failure were studied in a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial. Ibopamine 200 mg b.i.d. was compared to furosemide 40 mg q.d. and placebo. A 1- to 2-week single-blind run-in period was followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Reproducible treadmill exercise test times with the modified Naughton-Balke protocol were required for randomization. Exercise times increased significantly in comparison to the placebo group after 8 weeks of therapy for both the furosemide group (1.2 min, P < 0.035) and the ibopamine group (1.3 min, P < 0.025). Neither furosemide nor ibopamine affected quality of life assessments. Adverse clinical experiences were generally mild and similar in frequency amongst the three treatment groups. The results of this study show the usefulness of both ibopamine and furosemide as monotherapy in patients with mild congestive heart failure.
Summary:","A placebo-controlled trial assessed quality of life, edema, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and demonstrated no change in these outcomes in the treatment and placebo groups."

Query 1: Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction?
Document 1: Background-Treatment with diuretics has been reported to increase the risk of arrhythmic death in patients with hypertension. The effect of diuretic therapy on arrhythmic death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is unknown. Methods and Results-We conducted a retrospective analysis of 6797 patients with an ejection fraction <0.36 enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) to assess the relation between diuretic use at baseline and the subsequent risk of arrhythmic death. Participants receiving a diuretic at baseline were more likely to have an arrhythmic death than those not receiving a diuretic (3.1 vs 1.7 arrhythmic deaths per 100 person-years, P=0.001). On univariate analysis, diuretic use was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (relative risk [RR] 1.85, P=0.0001). After controlling for important covariates, diuretic use remained significantly associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 1.37, P=0.009). Only non-potassium-sparing diuretic use was independently associated with arrhythmic death (RR 1.33, P=0.02). Use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, alone or in combination with a non-potassium-sparing diuretic, was not independently associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 0.90, P=0.6). Conclusions-In SOLVD, baseline use of a non-potassium-sparing diuretic was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death, whereas baseline use of a potassium-sparing diuretic was not. These data suggest that diuretic-induced electrolyte disturbances may result in fatal arrhythmias in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction.
Summary 1: A retrospective study of SOLVD patients found a significant and independent association with increased risk of arrhythmic death among patients taking non-potassium-sparing diuretics (RR=1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69).

Query 2: Does a low-salt diet reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure?
Document 2: To review the management of congestive heart failure (CHF), with emphasis on older adults. A computer-assisted search of the English language literature (MEDLINE database) followed by a manual search of the bibliographies of pertinent articles. Studies on the management of CHF were screened for review. Studies in older people and recent studies were emphasized. Pertinent data were extracted from the reviewed articles. Emphasis was on studies involving the older persons. Relevant articles were reviewed in depth. Available data about the management of CHF, with emphasis on studies involving older people, were summarized. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be measured in all older persons with CHF. Underlying causes of CHF should be treated when possible. Precipitating causes of CHF should be treated. Older persons with CHF associated with an abnormal LVEF should be treated with a low sodium diet and with diuretics plus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. If CHF persists, digoxin should be added to the therapeutic regimen. If CHF still persists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added. If CHF still persists, a beta blocker should also be used. Calcium channel blockers should not be used. Older persons with CHF associated with a normal LVEF should be treated with a low sodium diet and with diuretics plus ACE inhibitors. If CHF persists, a beta blocker or isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine or a calcium channel blocker should be added to the therapeutic regimen. If sinus rhythm is present, digoxin should not be used. The role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as losartan in the treatment of CHF is under investigation.
Summary 2: Sodium restriction is a mainstay of nonpharmacologic therapy for congestive heart failure, although no evidence proves that sodium restriction alone reduces morbidity and mortality.

Query: Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction?
Document: To summarise the current evidence from randomised controlled trials for diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). English-language randomised controlled trials and review papers referenced in Medline, Embase between 1966 and 1999. General literature review of pertinent journals was carried out and reference lists of papers were inspected. REVIEW METHOD: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of diuretic therapy in patients with CHF. Studies were included if they were randomised comparisons of loop or thiazide diuretics and control, or one diuretic and another active agent (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ibopamine and digoxin). Using a standardised protocol, two reviewers independently abstracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of each paper. The odds ratio (OR) of treated group compared with control was estimated for each end-point outcome and plotted against each other using the fixed-effects model. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes of our analysis were effects of diuretics on mortality and morbidity. Eighteen trials met our criteria and were eligible for analysis, involving 928 patients. Eight trials were placebo-controlled. We analysed the data for mortality and for worsening heart failure. A further ten trials compared diuretics against other agents such as ACE inhibitors, ibopamine, and digoxin. Mortality data were available in three of the placebo-controlled trials (n=221); the mortality rate was lower for patients treated with diuretics than for control [the odds ratio for death, 0.25; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.07-0.84; P=0.03]. Admissions for worsening heart failure in the four small trials (n=448) showed an odds ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.15-0.62; P=0.001). In six studies of diuretics compared to active control, diuretics significantly improved exercise capacity in patients with CHF [OR: 0.37; CI: 0.10-0.64, P=0.007]. Compared to active control, diuretics appear to reduce the risk of worsening disease and improve exercise capacity. The available data from small studies show that in CHF conventional diuretics reduce the risk of death and worsening heart failure compared to placebo.
Summary:","Faris et al conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that used diuretics (pertanide, furosemide, furosemide-hydrochlorothiazide) in congestive heart failure (TABLE).4 Of the 18 trials, 8 were placebo-controlled and 10 used active controls (diuretics vs angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, digoxin, or ibopamine, a dopamine agonist). Three placebo-controlled trials (N=221) showed an absolute risk reduction in death of 8% in diuretic-treated patients (number needed to treat [NNT]=12.5). Four placebo-controlled trials (N=448) showed a significantly lower rate of admissions for worsening failure among diuretic-treated patients (NNT=8.5), and 4 of the active-controlled trials (N=150) showed a nonsignificant trend toward decreased admissions. Six active-controlled studies (N=174) showed significantly increased exercise capacity for patients on diuretics. The studies used in this meta-analysis had numerous shortcomings: the individual trials had small numbers of patients (N=14-139), short follow-up periods (typically 4-8 weeks), and inadequate statistical power to clearly demonstrate morbidity/mortality reductions. There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Crossover studies were included, some studies did not clearly report masking and assessment of outcome measures, and assessment of study validity was not clear. Studies employed a variety of diuretic types and doses, used different controls, and did not clarify whether patients' congestive heart failure was caused primarily by diastolic or systolic dysfunction."

Query 1: Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression?
Document 1: The cause of postpartum depression remains unclear, with extensive research suggesting a multi-factorial aetiology. However, epidemiological studies and meta-analyses of predictive studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of psychosocial and psychological variables. While interventions based on these variables may be effective treatment strategies, theoretically they may also be used in pregnancy and the early postpartum period to prevent postpartum depression. Primary: to assess the effect of diverse psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum care to reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression. Secondary: to examine (1) the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial and psychological interventions, (2) the effectiveness of individual versus group-based interventions, (3) the effects of intervention onset and duration, and (4) whether interventions are more effective in women selected with specific risk factors. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 27 2004), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (October 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (October 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), EMBASE (1980 to 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to 2004). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field. All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of acceptable quality comparing a psychosocial or psychological intervention with usual antenatal, intrapartum, or postpartum care. Both reviewers participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction. Additional information was sought from several trial researchers. Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for continuous data. Fifteen trials, involving over 7600 women, were included. Overall, women who received a psychosocial intervention were equally likely to develop postpartum depression as those receiving standard care (relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.02). One promising intervention appears to be the provision of intensive postpartum support provided by public health nurses or midwives (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84). Identifying mothers 'at-risk' assisted the prevention of postpartum depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89). Interventions with only a postnatal component appeared to be more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than interventions that also incorporated an antenatal component. While individually-based interventions may be more effective (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) than those that are group-based, women who received multiple-contact intervention were just as likely to experience postpartum depression as those who received a single-contact intervention. Overall psychosocial interventions do not reduce the numbers of women who develop postpartum depression. However, a promising intervention is the provision of intensive, professionally-based postpartum support.
Summary 1: A Cochrane meta-analysis of pooled data from 15 RCTs (7697 women) found that psychological interventions did not prevent PPD based on comparison of initial depression scores with scores at the conclusion of the studies (relative risk [RR]=0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.02).1 Although some studies suggested short-term benefit (N=4091; RR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-1.00), benefits diminished over time and were not noted when the definition of depression was limited to an Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) score below 12 (out of a maximum of 30). Some differences were found when the data were stratified. Certain interventions were found to prevent depressive symptoms (defined differently in the various studies). They were: home visits provided by healthcare professionals (2 RCTs, N=1663; RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.55-0.84), interventions targeting at-risk women (7 RCTs, N=1162; RR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.89), and interventions begun postnatally (10 RCTs, N=6379; RR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Notably, the level of training of providers of psychological interventions included in the meta-analysis was highly variable.

Query 2: Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression?
Document 2: First, to establish the efficacy of psychological interventions versus routine primary care for the management of postnatal depression (PND). Secondly, to provide a direct comparison of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) versus counselling and, finally, to compare the relative value of group and individual delivery formats. The study involved 192 depressed women drawn from a large community screening programme in Melbourne, Australia and allocated to cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling, or routine primary care. Baseline and post-intervention measures of depression and anxiety were collected in the form of validated self-report inventories. Women were screened in the community and diagnosis of depression confirmed with a standardized psychiatric interview. Interventions were of 12 weeks duration, including three partner sessions, and adhered to a structured manual. Psychological intervention per se was superior to routine care in terms of reductions in both depression and anxiety following intervention. For those women with PND, psychological intervention is a better option than routine care, leading to clinically significant reduction of symptoms. Counselling may be as effective as group cognitive behaviour therapy. The benefits of psychological intervention may be maximized by being delivered on a one-to-one basis.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials (N=121) also found psychological interventions (group cognitive-behavioral treatment and group and individual counseling) to be superior to routine primary care, with individual counseling yielding the greatest improvement in PPD symptoms (P<.05).

Query: Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression?
Document: Approximately 10% to 16% of women experience a major depressive episode after childbirth. A significant proportion of these women also suffer from comorbid anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to standard antidepressant therapy offers additional benefits in the treatment of post-partum depression with comorbid anxiety disorders. Thirty-five women referred to a tertiary care hospital outpatient program with a DSM-IV diagnosis of postpartum depression with comorbid anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups-paroxetine-only monotherapy group (N = 16) or paroxetine plus 12 sessions of CBT combination therapy group (N = 19)-for a 12-week trial. Progress was monitored by a psychiatrist blinded to treatment group, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Clinical Global Impressions scale, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Data were analyzed using 2-tailed statistical tests at an alpha level of.05. The study was conducted from April 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003. Both treatment groups showed a highly significant improvement (p <.01) in mood and anxiety symptoms. Groups did not differ significantly in week of recovery, dose of paroxetine at remission, or measures of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms at outcome. Antidepressant monotherapy and combination therapy with antidepressants and CBT were both efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms. However, in this sample of acutely depressed/anxious postpartum women, there were no additional benefits from combining the 2 treatment modalities. Further research into the efficacy of combination therapy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe depression with comorbid disorders in postpartum women is recommended.
Summary:","A small RCT (N=35) compared 12 weeks of paroxetine with a combination of paroxetine and CBT. Significant improvements-defined as percentage of patients in each group demonstrating at least a 50% score reduction on the HAM-D (paroxetine, 87.5%; combination, 78.9%) and EPDS (paroxetine, 61.5%; combination, 58.3%)-occurred in both groups (P<.01), but no difference was found between the groups. The study didn't include a placebo control group."

Query 1: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document 1: Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools.
Summary 1: A Systematic Review concluded that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for PHN. It found gabapentin to be effective, with a range of number needed to treat from 2.8 to 5.3 for as much as 50% pain reduction based on the visual analog score (VAS).

Query 2: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document 2: A systematic review of the literature on postherpetic neuralgia was performed. The authors identified studies using the National Library of Medicine's Medline database and Cochrane Library database. The authors determined absolute reduction rate, number needed to treat (NNT), 95% CI for NNT, and number needed to harm (NNH) for successful therapies of postherpetic neuralgia. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine patch were found to be effective in reducing the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.
Summary 2: Capsaicin, a topical counterirritant, reduced pain in fewer than 20% of patients in 2 RCTs reported in systematic reviews, with an number needed to treat of 3.26 (95% CI, 2.26-5.85). Blinding was limited in these studies because of the stinging associated with treatment.

Query: What is the best way to manage phantom limb pain?
Document: New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.
Summary:","Although PLP is typically treated as neuropathic pain, only a few medications have been critically evaluated for treating it."

Query 1: What is appropriate fetal surveillance for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes?
Document 1: Gestational diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in pregnancy affects between 3 and 6% of all pregnancies and both have been associated with pregnancy complications. A lack of conclusive evidence has led clinicians to equate the risk of adverse perinatal outcome with pre-existing diabetes. Consequently, women are often intensively managed with increased obstetric monitoring, dietary regulation, and in some cases insulin therapy. However, there has been no sound evidence base to support intensive treatment. The key issue for clinicians and consumers is whether treatment of gestational diabetes and IGT will improve perinatal outcome. The objective of this review was to compare alternative policies of care for women with gestational diabetes and IGT in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (12 September 2002) and the bibliographies of relevant papers. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was also searched (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002). Randomised controlled trials comparing alternative management strategies for women with gestational diabetes and IGT in pregnancy. Quality was assessed according to the criteria defined by the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook. Data were extracted and checked independently by two reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Three studies with a total of 223 women were included. All three included studies involved women with IGT. No trials reporting treatments for gestational diabetes met the criteria. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effect of treatments for IGT on perinatal outcome. The difference in abdominal operative delivery rates is not statistically significant (relative risk (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 1.45) and the effect on special care baby unit admission is also not significant (RR 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 1.24). Reduction in birthweight greater than 90th centile (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61) was not found to be significant. This review suggests that an interventionist policy of treatment may be associated with a reduced risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.86). No other statistically significant differences were detected. A number of outcomes are only reported by one study resulting in a small sample and wide confidence intervals. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effects of treatments for impaired glucose tolerance on perinatal outcome.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review found no evidence for or against increased surveillance in A1 gestational diabetes: ""A lack of conclusive evidence has lead clinicians to equate the risk of adverse perinatal outcome with pre-existing diabetes. Consequently women are often managed with increased obstetrical monitoring, dietary regulation, and [pharmacological] treatment. However, no sound evidence base supports such intensive treatment.""

Query 2: What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes?
Document 2: Fetuses of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk to develop perinatal complications mainly due to macrosomia. However, in view of the marked heterogeneity of this disease, it seems difficult to set guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. This complicates the choice of assigning patients either to diet or to insulin therapy. Also of concern is how much benefit could be expected from insulin therapy in preventing fetal complications in these patients. In a systematic review of the literature assessing the efficacy of insulin in preventing macrosomia in fetuses of mothers with gestational diabetes, we found six randomized controlled trials comparing diet alone to diet plus insulin. The studies included a total of 1281 patients (644 in the diet plus insulin group and 637 in the diet group), with marked differences among trials concerning diagnostic criteria, randomization process and treatment goals. Meta-analysis of the data resulted in a risk difference of -0.098 (95%CI: -0.168 to -0.028), and a number-necessary-to-treat of 11 (95%CI: 6 to 36), which means that it is necessary to treat 11 patients with insulin to prevent one case of macrosomia. This indicates a potential benefit of insulin, but not significantly enough to set treatment guidelines. Because of the heterogeneous evidence available in the literature about this matter, we conclude that larger trials addressing the efficacy of these two therapeutic modalities in preventing macrosomia are warranted.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis combined 6 RCTs comparing diet alone with diet plus insulin in a total of 1281 women. Insulin was moderately superior to diet in preventing fetal macrosomia (NNT=11; 95% confidence interval, 6-36), but not in rates of hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or congenital malformations.

Query: What is appropriate fetal surveillance for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes?
Document: Pregnancy in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased perinatal morbidity. Whether the perinatal mortality rate, particularly the fetal death rate, is greater in these patients remains controversial. The present study was undertaken to review the role of antepartum fetal monitoring in 69 patients with GDM controlled by diet only (class A) and 28 women requiring insulin therapy (class AB). Hypertension complicated 21.6% of these pregnancies. Antepartum fetal surveillance included outpatient nonstress testing, urinary estriol assays, maternal assessment of fetal activity, and clinical estimation of fetal weight. All insulin-requiring patients as well as fourteen class A patients with identifiable risk factors underwent testing. No perinatal deaths occurred. Only six patients required intervention for suspected fetal jeopardy and four of these women had hypertension. Macrosomia was correctly identified in only 6 of 16 infants weighing 4000 g or more. This study suggests that, in GDM, an outpatient program of fetal testing, using primarily the nonstress test and maternal assessment of fetal activity, can be employed in patients requiring insulin as well as class A patients with identifiable risk factors. This protocol resulted in a low rate of unnecessary intervention and good perinatal outcome. The risks for abnormal antepartum testing results appear increased in GDM with hypertension and prolonged pregnancy.
Summary:","A retrospective study followed 97 pregnant patients with gestational diabetes, 69 of whom were diet-controlled (class A1, fasting glucose <105 mg/dL).5 Antepartum surveillance consisted of maternal monitoring and non-stress testing. At 28 weeks, pregnant patients assessed daily fetal activity; reassuring fetal well-being was defined as 10 fetal movements in a 12-hour period. At 40 weeks, a non-stress test was performed weekly. Contraction stress testing was performed for those with nonreactive non-stress tests. To observe for macrosomia, serial ultrasonography was performed every 4 to 6 weeks, starting at 28 weeks. Forty-four patients (64%) had spontaneous labors without intervention, while the rest required induction of labor or cesarean section (primary or failed induction). Five patients had primary cesarean section for suspected macrosomia, 3 patients had intervention for suspected intrauterine growth restriction, and only 4 (5.7%) patients were delivered due to fetal indications, defined as decreased fetal movement or a nonreactive nonstress test. No stillbirths or neonatal deaths occurred. Perinatal complications included hypoglycemia (n=13; 19%), hyperbilirubinemia (n=12; 17%), and macrosomia (n=11; 16%). The study did not compare complication rates between diet-controlled and insulin-requiring patients."

Query 1: What treatment works best for tennis elbow?
Document 1: Lateral epicondylitis is generally treated with corticosteroid injections or physiotherapy. Dutch clinical guidelines recommend a wait-and-see policy. We compared the efficacy of these approaches. Patients with lateral epicondylitis of at least 6 weeks' duration were recruited by family doctors. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 6 weeks of treatment with corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see policy. Outcome measures included general improvement, severity of the main complaint, pain, elbow disability, and patient satisfaction. Severity of elbow complaints, grip strength, and pressure pain threshold were assessed by a research physiotherapist who was unaware of treatment allocation. We assessed all outcomes at 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The principal analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. We randomly assigned 185 patients. At 6 weeks, corticosteroid injections were significantly better than all other therapy options for all outcome measures. Success rates were 92% (57) compared with 47% (30) for physiotherapy and 32% (19) for wait-and-see policy. However, recurrence rate in the injection group was high. Long-term differences between injections and physiotherapy were significantly in favour of physiotherapy. Success rates at 52 weeks were 69% (43) for injections, 91% (58) for physiotherapy, and 83% (49) for a wait-and-see policy. Physiotherapy had better results than a wait-and-see policy, but differences were not significant. Patients should be properly informed about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options for lateral epicondylitis. The decision to treat with physiotherapy or to adopt a wait-and-see policy might depend on available resources, since the relative gain of physiotherapy is small.
Summary 1: I a randomized study with 3 treatment arms, 185 patients were treated with a corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see approach (ergonomic advice, rest, and oral anti-inflammatory medication). Corticosteroid injections were significantly more effective for the patients' main complaint at 6 weeks compared with wait-and-see (mean difference in improvement [MDI] on a 100-point scale=24; 95% CI, 14-35; NNT=2) or physiotherapy (MDI=20; 95% CI, 10-31; NNT=2). By contrast, at 26 and 52 weeks' follow-up, physiotherapy was more effective than steroid injections (MDI=15; 95% CI, 5-25) but statistically equivalent to a wait-and-see approach (MDI=7; 95% CI, -4 to 17).

Document 2: To evaluate the available evidence of the effectiveness of physiotherapy for lateral epicondylitis of the elbow. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference checking. Two independent reviewers selected RCTs that included a physiotherapy intervention, patients with lateral epicondylitis, and at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. No language restrictions were made. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two blinded reviewers. A best evidence synthesis, including a quantitative and qualitative analysis, was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. 23 RCTs were included in the review, evaluating the effects of lasertherapy, ultrasound treatment, electrotherapy, and exercises and mobilisation techniques. Fourteen studies satisfied at least 50% of the internal validity criteria. Except for ultrasound, pooling of data from RCTs was not possible because of insufficient data, or clinical or statistical heterogeneity. The pooled estimate of the treatment effects of two studies on ultrasound compared to placebo ultrasound, showed statistically significant and clinically relevant differences in favour of ultrasound. There is insufficient evidence either to demonstrate benefit or lack of effect of lasertherapy, electrotherapy, exercises and mobilisation techniques for lateral epicondylitis. Despite the large number of studies, there is still insufficient evidence for most physiotherapy interventions for lateral epicondylitis due to contradicting results, insufficient power, and the low number of studies per intervention. Only for ultrasound, weak evidence for efficacy was found. More better designed, conducted and reported RCTs are needed.
Summary 2: Pooling 2 studies in a different systematic review showed weak evidence that ultrasound reduced pain at 13 weeks compared with placebo (standardized mean difference=-0.98; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.33).

Query: What treatment works best for tennis elbow?
Document: To investigate the efficacy of physiotherapy compared with a wait and see approach or corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in tennis elbow. Single blind randomised controlled trial. Community setting, Brisbane, Australia. 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks' duration, who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous six months. Eight sessions of physiotherapy; corticosteroid injections; or wait and see. Global improvement, grip force, and assessor's rating of severity measured at baseline, six weeks, and 52 weeks. Corticosteroid injection showed significantly better effects at six weeks but with high recurrence rates thereafter (47/65 of successes subsequently regressed) and significantly poorer outcomes in the long term compared with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy was superior to wait and see in the short term; no difference was seen at 52 weeks, when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome. Participants who had physiotherapy sought less additional treatment, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, than did participants who had wait and see or injections. Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise has a superior benefit to wait and see in the first six weeks and to corticosteroid injections after six weeks, providing a reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term. The significant short term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after six weeks, with high recurrence rates, implying that this treatment should be used with caution in the management of tennis elbow.
Summary:","In an RCT, physiotherapy and exercise were significantly better than a wait-and-see approach at 6 weeks for pain-free grip force, rating of pain severity, and global improvement (RR=0.5; 99% CI, 0.2-0.8; NNT=3), but by 52 weeks the outcomes were statistically equal."

Query 1: Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery?
Document 1: Our purpose was to compare the controlled cord traction technique with the minimal intervention technique for delivery of the placenta. The primary outcome was the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes included duration of third stage of labor, frequency of retained placenta, hemorrhagic shock, the need for blood transfusion, and the need for uterotonic agents to control postpartum hemorrhage. A total of 1648 women who were delivered vaginally were randomly allocated during labor to the controlled cord traction group (n = 827) or the minimal intervention group (n = 821). In the controlled cord traction group women received oxytocin, 10 units intramuscularly, with delivery of the baby's anterior shoulder, after which the placenta was delivered actively by controlled cord traction (Brandt-Andrews method). In the minimal intervention group the placenta was delivered by maternal pushing. Continuous intravenous oxytocin was given after delivery of the placenta. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each variable. The overall incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was significantly lower in the controlled cord traction group (5.8% vs 11%; odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.73). The incidence of retained placenta (> or = 30 minutes) was 1.6% in the controlled cord traction group and 4.5% in the minimal intervention group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.63). Significantly more patients in the minimal intervention group required additional uterotonic agents to control hemorrhage (5.1% vs 2.3%; odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.78). The controlled cord traction technique for delivery of the placenta results in a significantly lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and retained placenta, as well as less need for uterotonic agents, compared with the minimal intervention technique.
Summary 1: A randomized controlled trials concluded that oxytocin is more effective in reducing postpartum hemorrhage when given before placental delivery (after delivery of the anterior shoulder and head, respectively). The study was neither blinded nor controlled for nonpharmacologic interventions, however.

Query 2: Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery?
Document 2: The objective of this study was to compare the administration of oxytocin at the beginning and end of the third stage of labor for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. Patients with documented singleton pregnancies were randomly assigned to two groups. The first received 10 units of oxytocin intramuscularly at delivery of the anterior shoulder of the fetus and an identical appearing placebo injection following delivery of the placenta. The second received the opposite medication sequence. The study was double blinded. Blood loss was measured by weighing all fluids collected, visual estimation, and serial blood counts. 27 women received oxytocin at the delivery of the fetal shoulder and 24 after the placenta. Oxytocin given after placenta delivery resulted in lower blood loss (345 vs. 400 ml, p = 0.28), lower collection bag weight (763 vs. 833 g, p = 0.55), lower change in HgB (-1.26 vs. -1.32 g, p = 0.86), lower DeltaHCT (-3.43 vs. -3.64%, p = 0.85), and a shorter third stage of labor duration (8.6 vs. 9.2 min, p = 0.75). The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, defined as estimated blood loss >500 ml (0 vs. 14.8%) was significantly lowered with oxytocin following placental delivery (p = 0.049). In our study, postpartum hemorrhage was less frequent when oxytocin administration was delayed until after placenta delivery.
Summary 2: A double-blinded randomized controlled trials found that postpartum hemorrhage occurred significantly less often when oxytocin was delayed until after delivery of the placenta. The study comprised 51 patients; 27 received 10 units of oxytocin on delivery of the anterior shoulder and 24 received an identical dose after delivery of the placenta. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage ≥500 mL was 0% when oxytocin was given after delivery of the placenta vs 14.8% when it was given on delivery of the anterior shoulder (P=.049). However, the study was limited by its size and potential inaccuracies in estimating blood loss.

Query: Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery?
Document: To determine if the timing of the administration of prophylactic oxytocin influences the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage caused by uterine atony, retained placenta, and third-stage duration. Parturients who presented for vaginal delivery were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive oxytocin, 20 units in a 500-mL crystalloid intravenous bolus, beginning upon delivery of either the fetal anterior shoulder or placenta. For all patients, the third stage of labor was managed with controlled cord traction until placental expulsion, followed by at least 15 seconds of fundal massage. Patients were excluded if they had a previous cesarean section, multiple gestation, antepartum hemorrhage, or bleeding disorder. A total of 1486 patients were enrolled: 745 in the before-placenta group and 741 in the after-placenta group. The groups were similar with respect to gestational age, fetal weight, labor duration, maternal age, parity, and ethnicity. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (5.4% vs 5.8%; crude OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.43). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to incidence of retained placenta (2.4% vs 1.6%; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.72 to 3.08), or third-stage duration (7.7 minutes vs 8.1 minutes; P =.23). The administration of prophylactic oxytocin before placental delivery does not reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage or third-stage duration, when compared with giving oxytocin after placental delivery. Early administration, however, does not increase the incidence of retained placenta.
Summary:","A well-constructed double-blinded RCT found no significant difference in the incidence of PPH when oxytocin was given after delivery of the anterior shoulder or the placenta. The study included 1486 patients; 745 received 20 units of oxytocin on delivery of the anterior shoulder, and 741 received an identical dose of oxytocin on delivery of the placenta. The incidence of PPH was 5.4% for the anterior shoulder group and 5.8% for the placenta group (P=.72). Likewise, no significant difference between the groups was noted in the proportion of women with estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥500 mL (7.5% vs 9.7%; P=.15)."

Query 1: What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level?
Document 1: Low serum thyrotropin concentrations are a sensitive indicator of hyperthyroidism but can also occur in persons who have no clinical manifestations of the disorder. We studied whether low serum thyrotropin concentrations in clinically euthyroid older persons are a risk factor for subsequent atrial fibrillation. We studied 2007 persons (814 men and 1193 women) 60 years of age or older who did not have atrial fibrillation in order to determine the frequency of this arrhythmia during a 10-year follow-up period. The subjects were classified according to their serum thyrotropin concentrations: those with low values (< or = 0.1 mU per liter; 61 subjects); those with slightly low values (> 0.1 to 0.4 mU per liter; 187 subjects); those with normal values (> 0.4 to 5.0 mU per liter; 1576 subjects); and those with high values (> 5.0 mU per liter; 183 subjects). During the 10-year follow-up period, atrial fibrillation occurred in 13 persons with low initial values for serum thyrotropin, 23 with slightly low values, 133 with normal values, and 23 with high values. The cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation at 10 years was 28 percent among the subjects with low serum thyrotropin values (< or = 0.1 mU per liter), as compared with 11 percent among those with normal values; the age-adjusted incidence of atrial fibrillation was 28 per 1000 person-years among those with low values and 10 per 1000 person-years among those with normal values (P = 0.005). After adjustment for other known risk factors, the relative risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly subjects with low serum thyrotropin concentrations, as compared with those with normal concentrations, was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 5.5; P < 0.001). The 10-year incidence of atrial fibrillation in the groups with slightly low and high serum thyrotropin values was not significantly different from that in the group with normal values. Among people 60 years of age or older, a low serum thyrotropin concentration is associated with a threefold higher risk that atrial fibrillation will develop in the subsequent decade.
Summary 1: In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism aged >60 years, the cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation after 10 years varied with the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level: it was 28% in those with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone <0.1 mIU/L; 16% in those with values between 0.1 and 0.4 mIU/L, and 11 % in those with normal values.

Query 2: What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level?
Document 2: Low serum thyrotropin, in combination with normal concentrations of circulating thyroid hormones, is common, especially in elderly people and in individuals with a history of thyroid disease. We aimed to assess the long-term effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism on mortality. We did a population-based study of mortality in a cohort of 1191 individuals not on thyroxine or antithyroid medication. All participants were aged 60 years or older. We measured concentration of thyrotropin in serum at baseline in 1988-89. We recorded vital status on June 1, 1999, and ascertained causes of death for those who had died. We compared data for causes of death with age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific data for England and Wales. We also compared mortality within the cohort according to initial thyrotropin measurement. During 9733 person-years of follow-up, 509 of 1191 people died, the expected number of deaths being 496 (standardised mortality ratio [SMR] 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1). Mortality from all causes was significantly increased at 2 (SMR 2.1), 3 (2.1), 4 (1.7), and 5 (1.8) years after first measurement in those with low serum thyrotropin (n471). These increases were largely accounted for by significant increases in mortality due to circulatory diseases (SMR 2.1, 2.2, 1.9, 2.0, at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Increases in mortality from all causes in years 2-5 were higher in patients with low serum thyrotropin than in the rest of the cohort (hazard ratios for years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.1, 2.2, 1.8, and 1.8, respectively). This result reflects an increase in mortality from circulatory diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.3, 2.6, 2.3, 2.3), and specifically from cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 3.3, 3.0, 2.3, 2.2). A single measurement of low serum thyrotropin in individuals aged 60 years or older is associated with increased mortality from all causes, and in particular mortality due to circulatory and cardiovascular diseases.
Summary 2: Patients aged >60 years with at least 1 suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone value have an increase in mortality over 5 years (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]=1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.7). At 10 years, the SMR was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.7). It appears that this is primarily related to cardiovascular mortality.

Query: What causes a low TSH level with a normal free T4 level?
Document: To investigate the effects of long term thyroid hormone suppressive therapy on the heart, 20 patients were evaluated by noninvasive techniques. Of them, 10 were athyreotic after surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer, and 10 had diffuse or nodular goiter. The mean age of the group was 39 +/- 11 yr. Twenty age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls. The mean dose of levothyroxine was 163 +/- 34 micrograms daily. Plasma TSH was undetectable in all patients. Mean serum T4, free T4, and sex hormone-binding globulin were significantly higher (P < 0.001), whereas mean serum T3, free T3, and osteocalcin did not differ from control levels. Cardiac evaluation consisted of a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, an ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter), and an echocardiographic study. Two patients showed abnormal electrocardiograms for left ventricular hypertrophy. Holter demonstrated an increase in average heart rate (84 +/- 7 vs. 70 +/- 6 beats/min; P < 0.01). Prevalence of atrial premature beats was higher in the patient group than in the control group (100% vs. 60%; P < 0.006). The echocardiogram showed an increased left ventricular mass index in the patient group (97 +/- 24 vs. 80 +/- 18 g/m2; P < 0.02). Furthermore, left ventricular systolic function was enhanced, with higher values of fractional shortening (38 +/- 7% vs. 34 +/- 4%; P < 0.05) and rate-adjusted velocity of shortening (1.2 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.14 circumferences/sec; P < 0.01). These findings indicate that long term levothyroxine therapy at suppressive doses markedly affects cardiac function.
Summary:","Patients with SCH have been reported to have increased heart rate, contractility, left ventricular mass, and increased risk of diastolic dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias."

Query 1: Are antibiotics effective in preventing pneumonia for nursing home patients?
Document 1: Vaccination of health care workers (HCWs) is recommended as a strategy for preventing influenza in elderly patients in long-term care. However, there have been no controlled studies to show whether this approach is effective. During the winter of 1994-1995, 1059 patients in 12 geriatric medical long-term-care sites, randomized for vaccination of HCWs, were studied. In hospitals where HCWs were offered vaccination, 653 (61%) of 1078 were vaccinated. Vaccination of HCWs was associated with reductions in total patient mortality from 17% to 10% (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.80) and in influenza-like illness (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.94). Vaccination of patients was not associated with significant effects on mortality (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81-1.64). Results of this study support recommendations for vaccination against influenza of HCWs in long-term geriatric care. Vaccination of frail elderly long-term-care patients may not give clinically worthwhile benefits.
Summary 1: A cluster randomized trial in British long-term care facilities demonstrated that influenza vaccination of health care workers (61% of 1078 workers) reduced the total nursing home mortality rate (odds ratio [OR]=0.56 [95% CI, 0.4-0.8]) for a drop in mortality rate from 17% to 10% (number needed to treat [NNT]=14.3).

Query 2: What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B?
Document 2: To determine whether repeated screening can lead to early detection of primary liver cancer (PLC) and in turn to an improved clinical result. In this randomized controlled study, Shanghai urban residents aged 35-55 years and with serum evidence of HBV infection or chronic liver disease were eligible for recruitment. Using cluster sampling, these subjects were allocated into two groups-the screening group and the control group: there were 8109 subjects in the screening group and 9711 in the control group. Subjects in the screening group were tested with serum AFP and real-time ultrasound every 6 months. One to four rounds of screening were completed. Liver cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis. All subjects enrolled were followed up and classed at the end-point as alive without liver cancer, alive with liver cancer, dead from liver cancer, or dead from another cause. The mean follow-up was 1.2 years; total follow-up was 12,038 person-years in the screening group and 9,573 person-years in the control group. We detected 38 patients with PLC in the screening group and 18 patients with PLC in the control group. In the patients in the screening group 76.8% of patients were at a subclinical stage, and 70.6% of them underwent resection, the 1- and 2-year survival rates being 88.1% and 77.5%, respectively. However, in the control group, none of the patients was at a subclinical stage when diagnosed, none of them underwent resection, and none of them survived over 1 year. The lead time was estimated at 0.45 years. The cost of detecting PLC at an early stage was RMB 12,600 (US$1,500). The study proved that screening the high-risk population for PLC with a serum AFP test and real-time ultrasound examination can detect patients in the early stages, increase the resection rate and prolong the survival time. It is therefore recommended that screening for PLC be advocated in any high-risk area.
Summary 2: A trial was performed in Shanghai, China and included 18,816 HBsAg+ patients aged 35 to 55 years. Subjects were recruited from their place of employment and randomized to either AFP/US every 6 months (n=9373) or to no screening (n=9443). Fifty-one hepatocellular carcinomas were diagnosed in the control group and 86 in screened group. Screened subjects had a significantly higher percentage of tumors that were less than 5 cm at the time of diagnosis and a higher number of patients who underwent resection. While the 5-year survival for those with hepatocellular carcinoma in the screened group was higher, the disease-specific mortality rate was not statistically different between the 2 groups.

Query: Who should get hepatitis A vaccination?
Document: Travelers to developing countries participated in a follow-up study of the health risks associated with short (less than three months) visits to these nations. Travelers to the Greek or Canary Islands served as a control cohort. Participants completed a questionnaire to elicit information regarding pretravel vaccinations, malaria prophylaxis, and health problems during and after their journey. Relevant infections were confirmed by the respondent's personal physician. The questionnaire was completed by 10,524 travelers; the answer rate was 73.8%. After a visit to developing countries, 15% of the travelers reported health problems, 8% consulted a doctor, and 3% were unable to work for an average of 15 days. The incidence of infection per month abroad was as follows: giardiasis, 7/1,000; amebiasis, 4/1,000; hepatitis, 4/1,000; gonorrhea, 3/1,000; and malaria, helminthiases, or syphilis, less than 1/1,000. There were no cases of typhoid fever or cholera.
Summary:",Prospective studies indicate that persons traveling in areas with high rates of HAV are themselves at 44 times increased risk.

Query 1: What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes?
Document 1: Differentiation between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in adults is difficult at diagnosis. In this study we tested the hypothesis that autoantibodies at diagnosis are predictive for insulin treatment within 3 years in patients initially not classified as Type 1 diabetes. In a nationwide population-based study, blood samples were obtained from 764 patients, all diagnosed with diabetes during a 2-year period. At diagnosis, 583 (76%) were classified as Type 1, 110 (14%) as Type 2 and 71 (9.3%) could not be classified. Among patients not classified as Type 1 diabetes, 52 (47%) of Type 2 and 42 (59%) of unclassified patients were positive for islet cell antibodies (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) or tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2A). These patients (n=94) had lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001) and lower C-peptide (p<0.001) compared to the autoantibody negative patients (n=87). Compared to clinically classified Type 1 diabetes patients positive for autoantibodies (n=477), they have higher BMI (p<0.001), higher C-peptide (p<0.001) and the same levels of ICA, GADA and IA-2A. After 3 years, 93% of autoantibody positive patients initially not classified as Type 1 were on insulin. When ICA, GADA, IA-2A, BMI and C-peptide were tested in a multiple logistic regression, only GADA was significant for insulin treatment within 3 years (OR=18.8; 95% CI 1.8-191) in patients treated with diet or oral drugs at diagnosis. A correct classification is difficult in adult diabetic patients. The presence of pancreatic autoantibodies, especially GADA, at diagnosis of diabetes are highly predictive for insulin therapy within 3 years from diagnosis.
Summary 1: A study in young adults with type 2 or unclassified diabetes from Sweden found 93% of patients who were GADAb+ required insulin at 3 years, compared with 51% who were GADAb-(OR=18.8; 95% CI, 1.8-191).

Query 2: What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes?
Document 2: This study was undertaken to examine the trends in the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents with new-onset diabetes seen from 1994 through 1998 at the three university-based diabetes centers in Florida. Data were abstracted from medical records and patients were categorized as having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. There were 569 patients classified with Type 1 diabetes and 92 with Type 2 diabetes. The proportion of patients diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes increased over the five years from 9.4% in 1994 to 20.0% in 1998 (chi-square test for trend = 8.2; p=0.004). There was not an associated net increase in the total number of new diabetes patients referred over time (chi-square test for trend = 0.6, p=0.4). Those with Type 2 diabetes were more likely to have a body mass index in the 85th-94th percentile [odds ratio (OR) = 8.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5, 28.8], have a body mass index >or=95th percentile (OR = 6.8; 95% CI 2.6, 17.7), Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 6.2; 95% CI 2.2, 17.9), black race (OR = 2.8; 95% CI 1.3, 6.2), female gender (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.2, 4.3), and older age (OR = 1.4 for each one-year increment in age; 95% CI 1.3, 1.6), compared with those having Type 1 diabetes. From 1994 through 1998, there was a significant overall increase in the percentage of children referred with new-onset diabetes who were considered to have Type 2 diabetes. Factors associated with the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes relative to Type 1 diabetes include body mass index >/=85th percentile, Hispanic ethnicity, black race, female gender, and older age.
Summary 2: A patient's age may suggest, but does not reliably distinguish, diabetes types. A study of 569 new-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetic children and adolescents showed that older age was only weakly associated with type 2 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]= 1.4 for each 1-year increment in age; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.6).

Query: What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes?
Document: To clarify whether random C-peptide is a valuable test in the classification of diabetes. All C-peptide measurements conducted in the diabetic population of Skaraborg (280,539 inhabitants and 3.2% diabetes) between 1995 and 1998 (3,115 samples) were considered, but only patients with well-defined diabetes type (1,449 samples from 1,093 patients) were analyzed for the correlation between diabetes type and C-peptide concentration. Serum C-peptide was measured after fasting over night (fCP), after glucagon stimulation (gCP), and randomly (rCP) without considering previous meals at an ordinary visit to the diabetic clinic (rCP). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to illustrate the power of the different C-peptide protocols and to determine the optimal cut-off values. Although all three tests had high discriminative power, the ROC curves demonstrated that rCP was superior to fCP and gCP in discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetes. The optimal cut-off value for rCP was 0.50 nmol/L, for fCP 0.42 nmol/L, and for gCP 0.60 nmol/L. rCP is more powerful than fCP and gCP in distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes and can therefore be recommended as a classification tool, particularly in outpatients.
Summary:","Although daily variation in serum insulin levels limits its use, C-peptide levels show more promise. Random C-peptide levels were superior to fasting or glucagon stimulated levels in 1093 patients, who were followed for 3 years to confirm insulin requirements. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve for random C-peptide levels to distinguish diabetes types was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.99). For patients under the optimal cutoff of 0.5 nmol/L, the positive predictive value was 96% for diagnosing type 1 and the likelihood ratio was 22.5."

Query 1: What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetes?
Document 1: Renal function declines progressively in patients who have diabetic nephropathy, and the decline may be slowed by antihypertensive drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether captopril has kidney-protecting properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy. We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing captopril with placebo in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom urinary protein excretion was > or = 500 mg per day and the serum creatinine concentration was < or = 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 mumol per liter). Blood-pressure goals were defined to achieve control during a median follow-up of three years. The primary end point was a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration. Two hundred seven patients received captopril, and 202 placebo. Serum creatinine concentrations doubled in 25 patients in the captopril group, as compared with 43 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.007). The associated reductions in risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration were 48 percent in the captopril group as a whole, 76 percent in the subgroup with a baseline serum creatinine concentration of 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mumol per liter), 55 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 mumol per liter), and 17 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.0 mg per deciliter (88.4 mumol per liter). The mean (+/- SD) rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 11 +/- 21 percent per year in the captopril group and 17 +/- 20 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.03). Among the patients whose base-line serum creatinine concentration was > or = 1.5 mg per deciliter, creatinine clearance declined at a rate of 23 +/- 25 percent per year in the captopril group and at a rate of 37 +/- 25 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Captopril treatment was associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of the combined end points of death, dialysis, and transplantation that was independent of the small disparity in blood pressure between the groups. Captopril protects against deterioration in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy and is significantly more effective than blood-pressure control alone.
Summary 1: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Query 2: For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy?
Document 2: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial comparing tight control of blood pressure aiming at a blood pressure of <150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a beta blocker atenolol as main treatment) with less tight control aiming at a blood pressure of <180/105 mm Hg. 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median follow up of 8.4 years. Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinal photography. Mean blood pressure during follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013), and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99% confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%) (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. Tight blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration in visual acuity.
Summary 2: In the UKPDS-Hypertension in Diabetes study (a multicenter randomized study in patients with type 2 diabetes that evaluated the effects of different levels of blood pressure control on diabetic complications), researchers found that patients assigned to the tight-control group (blood pressure goal <150/85 mm Hg) had 37% risk reduction in microvascular endpoints (nephropathy and advanced retinopathy). There was no difference in study endpoints between the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril and the beta-blocker atenolol.

Query: What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes?
Document: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure, despite the lack of data from randomised intervention trials to show that such treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths. Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044). Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.
Summary:",There is no evidence that ACE inhibitors are superior to b-blockers or diuretics in preventing cardiovascular outcomes at similar levels of blood pressure reduction.

Query 1: What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy?
Document 1: To determine the relative efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the treatment of diabetic neuroapathy and postherpetic neuralgia, published reports were identified from a variety of electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and from two previously published reviews. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. The relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief was calculated from available dichotomous data, as was the relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-harm (NH) for minor adverse effects and drug related study withdrawal. In diabetic neuropathy, 16 reports compared antidepressants with placebo (491 patient episodes) and three compared anticonvulsants with placebo (321). The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief with antidepressants was 3.4 (95 % confidence interval 2.6-4. 7) and with anticonvulsants 2. 7 (2. 2-3. 8). In postherpetic neuralgia, three reports compared antidepressants with placebo (145 patient episodes) and one compared anticonvulsants with placebo (225), giving an NNT with antidepressants of 2.1 (1. 7-3) and with anticonvulsants 3.2 (2.4-5). There was little difference in the incidence of minor adverse effects with either antidepressants or anticonvulsants compared with placebo, with 1VH (minor) values of about 3. For drug-related study withdrawal, antidepressants had an NNH (major) of 17 (11-43) compared with placebo, whereas with anticonvulsants there was no significant difference from placebo. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants had the same efficacy and incidence of minor adverse effects in these tzoo neuropathic pain conditions. There was no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were better than older antidepressants, and no evidence that gabapentin was better than older anticonvulsants. In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.
Summary 1: Limited evidence suggests that SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo.

Query 2: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document 2: A systematic review of the literature on postherpetic neuralgia was performed. The authors identified studies using the National Library of Medicine's Medline database and Cochrane Library database. The authors determined absolute reduction rate, number needed to treat (NNT), 95% CI for NNT, and number needed to harm (NNH) for successful therapies of postherpetic neuralgia. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine patch were found to be effective in reducing the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.
Summary 2: Capsaicin, a topical counterirritant, reduced pain in fewer than 20% of patients in 2 RCTs reported in systematic reviews, with an number needed to treat of 3.26 (95% CI, 2.26-5.85). Blinding was limited in these studies because of the stinging associated with treatment.

In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.
Summary:","A well-done meta-analysis summarized available randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (including tricyclics and SSRIs) and anticonvulsants (including phenytoin, carbamazepine, and gabapentin). Almost all trials compare individual agents against placebo, and there have been no head-to-head trials that address functional outcomes, quality of life, patient satisfaction, or cost. Most trials do not describe diagnostic criteria, consider causes of pain other than diabetes or address diabetic control, which is known to predict frequency of neuropathy. Finally, very few trials include typical primary care patients in a primary care setting or control for important confounding variables such as over-the-counter medications or comorbid illnesses. Within the constraints of this literature, placebos have a substantial impact, with an aggregate 32% of patients receiving placebo reporting at least 50% reduction in pain. A total of 16 trials have addressed the efficacy of antidepressants for diabetic neuropathy. Compared with placebo, tricyclic antidepressants have an aggregate NNT of 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-4.7) for patients reporting at least 50% reduction of pain, along with an NNH of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1-3.9) for minor adverse effects (typically the muscarinic effects of dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision) and 17 (95% CI, 10-43) for side effects severe enough to cause withdrawal from a trial. Dosages were in the low to middle range of those used to treat depression; there was no significant difference in efficacy between trials less than 3 weeks and those greater than 3 weeks. A total of 4 randomized placebo-controlled trials (1 each for phenytoin [Dilantin], carbamazepine [Tegretol], gabapentin [Neurontin], and valproate [Depakote]) have extractable data about the efficacy of anticonvulsants for the pain of diabetic neuropathy. As a class, the NNT for patients reporting at least a 50% reduction in pain was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.2-3.8); the NNH for minor adverse effects (typically transient central nervous system effect such as dizziness, somnolence, or disturbance in gait) was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.2-3.4)."

Query 1: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 1: Inhaled bronchodilators form the mainstay of treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. Two types of agent are used routinely, either singly or in combination: anticholinergic agents and beta2-sympathomimetic agonists. To assess the effect of anti-cholinergic agents on lung function and dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, compared with placebo or short-acting beta-2 agonists. A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD Trials Register, using the terms: bronchodilator* OR ipratropium OR oxitropium. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Studies were included if the participants were adult patients with a known diagnosis of COPD and had symptoms consistent with criteria for acute exacerbation of COPD. All randomized controlled trials that compared inhaled ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide to appropriate controls were considered. Appropriate control treatments included placebo, other bronchodilating agents, or combination therapies. Studies of acute asthma or ventilated patients were excluded. All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. Four trials compared the short-term effects of ipratropium bromide vs. a beta2-agonist. Short-term changes in FEV1 (up to 90 minutes) showed no significant difference between beta2-agonist and ipratropium bromide treated patients. The differences were similar among the studies and when combined: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.0 liters (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) -0.19, 0.19). There was no significant additional increase in change in FEV1 on adding ipratropium to beta2-agonist: WMD 0.02 liter (95% CI -0.08, 0.12). Long-term effects (24 hours) of the ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist treatment combination were similar: WMD 0.05 liters (95%CI -0.14, 0.05). Neither of two studies found significant changes in PaO2, either short- or long-term, with ipratropium vs. beta-agonist, although one showed an increase in PaO2 in subjects receiving ipratropium bromide at 60 minutes. Adverse drug reactions included dry mouth and tremor. There was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation achieved with ipratropium bromide was greater than that using a short-acting beta2-agonist. The combination of a beta2-agonist and ipratropium did not appear to increase the effect on FEV1 more than either used alone.
Summary 1: A recent Cochrane Review comparing the short-term effects of ipratropium to β2-agonists in changes in FEV1and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) concluded there was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation from ipratropium was greater than that from short-acting β2-agonists. Subjective endpoints such as dyspnea and quality of life were not assessed, and neither of the above reviews included studies focusing on long-term outcomes.

Query 2: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 2: One of the major goals of bronchodilator therapy in patients with COPD is to decrease airflow limitation in the airways and, as a consequence, improve dyspnea and exercise tolerance. The focus of this systematic review is to assess the effects of treatment with beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and theophyllines on dyspnea, and steady-state and incremental exercise capacity. Thirty-three, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies written in English were selected. This review shows that approximately half of the studies showed a significant effect of bronchodilator therapy on exercise capacity. Anticholinergic agents have significant beneficial effects in the majority of studies, especially when measured by steady-state exercise protocols. There is a trend toward a better effect of high-dose compared to low-dose anticholinergics. Short-acting beta(2)-mimetics have favorable effects on exercise capacity in more than two thirds of the studies; surprisingly, the situation is less clear for long-acting beta(2)-agents. The majority of the results of the published reports on theophyllines and their effects on exercise are negative. Direct comparisons of different classes of bronchodilators have not been made in a sufficient number of studies for a rational preference. The addition of a second bronchodilator has no proven advantage for improving exercise test results, but this has not been studied extensively and not in sufficiently large studies. The majority of studies reporting a measure of dyspnea found improvements, even in the absence of improvement in exercise capacity.
Summary 2: A review of 33 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled studies showed a significant effect of bronchodilator therapy on exercise capacity in COPD patients in about one half of studies. Anticholinergic agents had significant beneficial effects in the majority, and these effects tended to be somewhat dose-dependent. Short-acting β2-agonists improved exercise capacity in more than two thirds of the studies, but long-acting agents led to mixed outcomes. The researchers identified no superior agent between the 2 classes, citing a lack of adequate studies making a direct comparison.

Query: Do inhaled beta-agonists control cough in URIs or acute bronchitis?
Document: The optimal treatment for acute bronchitis is not clear. Because many patients with acute bronchitis have airflow limitation as well as cough, beta2-agonists may be useful. To determine whether beta2-agonists improve the symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease. The Cochrane Library (through August 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1974 to 2000), and Conference Proceedings using ""bronchodilator (exp)"", ""adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)"", or ""sympathomimetics (exp)"" and ""bronchitis"" or ""cough""; Science Citation Index for referenced publications; and letters to manufacturers of beta2-agonists. An updated search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 3, 2003); MEDLINE (January 2000 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 2000 to July 2003) was run in July 2003. Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) without known pulmonary disease who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough without other cause were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment. Three reviewers independently first selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, and then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately. Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the number of patients still coughing after seven days (control rate 73%; RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.54-1.09). Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists in one trial; and the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than patients in the control groups (for trials in children control rate 0%; RR 6.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 53.12, NNH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; for trials in adults, control rate 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94, NNH 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3). There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction; but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.
Summary:","A systematic review looking at beta-agonists for acute bronchitis included the clinical diagnoses of both acute bronchitis and acute cough because a standard definition of bronchitis is lacking. Only two trials in this review examined inhaled beta-agonists. When results from these trials were combined for the outcome of productive cough at 7 days, inhaled beta-agonists showed no benefit. However, the authors note that details of the individual trials may help to clarify the effect of inhaled beta-agonists."

Query 2: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 2: Tiotropium, a once-daily anticholinergic, and salmeterol represent two inhaled, long-acting bronchodilators from different pharmacologic classes. A trial was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of both compounds with multiple outcome measures, including lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with COPD. A 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study of tiotropium, 18 microg once daily via dry-powder inhaler, compared with salmeterol, 50 microg bid via metered-dose inhaler, was conducted in patients with COPD. Efficacy was assessed by 12-h monitoring of spirometry, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). A total of 623 patients participated (tiotropium, n= 209; salmeterol, n = 213; and placebo, n = 201). The groups were similar in age (mean, 65 years), gender (75% men), and baseline FEV(1) (mean, 1.08 +/- 0.37 L; percent predicted, 40 +/- 12% [+/- SD]). Compared with placebo treatment, the mean predose morning FEV(1) following 6 months of therapy increased significantly more for the tiotropium group (0.14 L) than the salmeterol group (0.09 L; p < 0.01). The average FEV(1) (0 to 12 h) for tiotropium was statistically superior to salmeterol (difference, 0.08 L; p < 0.001). Tiotropium improved TDI focal score by 1.02 U compared with placebo (p = 0.01), whereas there was no significant change in TDI focal score with salmeterol (0.24 U). Tiotropium was superior to salmeterol in improving TDI focal score (p < 0.05). At 6 months, the mean improvement in SGRQ total score vs baseline was tiotropium, - 5.14 U (p < 0.05 vs placebo); salmeterol, - 3.54 U (p = 0.4 vs placebo); and placebo, - 2.43 U. A statistically higher proportion of patients receiving tiotropium achieved at least a 4-U change in SGRQ score compared to patients receiving placebo. Both active drugs reduced the need for rescue albuterol (p < 0.0001). Tiotropium once daily produces superior bronchodilation, improvements in dyspnea, and proportion of patients achieving meaningful changes in HRQoL compared to twice-daily salmeterol in patients with COPD.
Summary 2: A 6-month, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of salmeterol 50 µg twice daily vs tiotropium (a new long-acting inhaled anticholinergic) 18 µg once daily was published in 2002. Endpoints in 623 patients were assessed using 12-hour spirometric performance, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). (SGRQ is a validated disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being. It measures activity limitations, symptoms, and psychosocial impact.) Tiotropium showed superiority over salmeterol in all endpoints assessed (0.14 L increase in morning FEV1vs 0.09 L, 1.02 U improvement in TDI score vs 0.24, and -5.14 U improvement of SGRQ total score from baseline vs -3.54). However, it should be noted that a difference of 1 on the TDI score was necessary to suggest a clinical benefit. While the overall difference in SGQR between tiotropium and salmeterol did not reach statistical significance, the proportion of patients in the tiotropium group that reached the clinically significant threshold of 4 units improvement in SGRQ score was significantly higher than in the salmeterol group (51% vs 40%; P<.05).

Query: Do inhaled beta-agonists control cough in URIs or acute bronchitis?
Document: Previous research has suggested that cough associated with acute bronchitis is more likely to subside within 7 days when treated with albuterol than with an antibiotic. This study examines the effectiveness of aerosolized albuterol for the treatment of acute bronchitis in patients treated with erythromycin or placebo. A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) was conducted in a primary care setting with healthy adult patients who presented with a productive cough of fewer than 30 days' duration. In addition to randomization for albuterol, patients were also randomized to receive erythromycin or placebo. Outcomes were assessed at follow-up after 7 days. Patients treated with albuterol MDI were less likely to be coughing after 7 days of treatment than were patients using a placebo inhaler (61% still coughing vs 91%, P = .02). When analysis was stratified by cigarette smoking status and the use of erythromycin, the differences observed between albuterol MDI patients and controls persisted. Albuterol appears to reduce the likelihood that patients with acute bronchitis will be coughing after 7 days following initiation of treatment. This effect appears to be independent of cigarette smoking or the concomitant use of antibiotics.
Summary:","One trial, a randomized controlled trial of adult patients with acute bronchitis in 2 community-based family practices, compared 23 patients receiving albuterolin a multidose inhaler (MDI) with 23 patients receiving placebo inhaler. Patients were also randomized to receive erythromycin or placebo tablets. Patients with pneumonia or a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were excluded. At 7 days, 61% of patients in the albuterol group reported cough compared with 91% in the control group (P=.02, NNT=3). No statistically significant difference was seen in productive cough or night cough. Smokers responded to inhaled albuterol similarly to nonsmokers. Erythromycin had no effect on cough and side effects were similar among all groups."

Query 1: Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches?
Document 1: To compare the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and pharmaceutical treatment (amitriptyline) for chronic tension-type headache. Randomized controlled trial using two parallel groups. The study consisted of a 2-wk baseline period, a 6-wk treatment period and a 4-wk posttreatment, follow-up period. Chiropractic college outpatient clinic. One hundred and fifty patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with a diagnosis of tension-type headaches of at least 3 months' duration at a frequency of at least once per wk. 6 wk of spinal manipulative therapy provided by chiropractors or 6 wk of amitriptyline treatment managed by a medical physician. Change in patient-reported daily headache intensity, weekly headache frequency, over-the-counter medication usage and functional health status (SF-36). A total of 448 people responded to the recruitment advertisements; 298 were excluded during the screening process. Of the 150 patients who were enrolled in the study, 24 (16%) dropped out: 5 (6.6%) from the spinal manipulative therapy and 19 (27.1%) from the amitriptyline therapy group. During the treatment period, both groups improved at very similar rates in all primary outcomes. In relation to baseline values at 4 wk after cessation of treatment, the spinal manipulation group showed a reduction of 32% in headache intensity, 42% in headache frequency, 30% in over-the-counter medication usage and an improvement of 16% in functional health status. By comparison, the amitriptyline therapy group showed no improvement or a slight worsening from baseline values in the same four major outcome measures. Controlling for baseline differences, all group differences at 4 wk after cessation of therapy were considered to be clinically important and were statistically significant. Of the patients who finished the study, 46 (82.1%) in the amitriptyline therapy group reported side effects that included drowsiness, dry mouth and weight gain. Three patients (4.3%) in the spinal manipulation group reported neck soreness and stiffness. The results of this study show that spinal manipulative therapy is an effective treatment for tension headaches. Amitriptyline therapy was slightly more effective in reducing pain at the end of the treatment period but was associated with more side effects. Four weeks after the cessation of treatment, however, the patients who received spinal manipulative therapy experienced a sustained therapeutic benefit in all major outcomes in contrast to the patients that received amitriptyline therapy, who reverted to baseline values. The sustained therapeutic benefit associated with spinal manipulation seemed to result in a decreased need for over-the-counter medication. There is a need to assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy beyond four weeks and to compare spinal manipulative therapy to an appropriate placebo such as sham manipulation in future clinical trials.
Summary 1: Two trials investigated the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy on tension-type headaches. The first, an randomized controlled trials with 150 patients with recurrent headaches, compared spinal manipulative therapy (2 sessions per week) with amitriptyline (10 mg daily week 1, 20 mg daily week 2, then 30 mg daily) for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, the spinal manipulative therapy group reported a nonsignificant trend toward more headache pain (ES for spinal manipulative therapy vs amitriptyline= -0.4; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.0), but fewer side effects. They had similar headache frequency and medication use.

Query 2: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 2: The efficacy of an integrated, psychological treatment program was tested in a controlled study involving 27 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (fibromyalgia). The experimental treatment program consisted of instruction in various self-help techniques (e.g., cognitive behavioral strategies, relaxation, physical exercises) as well as information on chronic pain. Control groups were instructed only in autogenic training. Measures of pain, daily activities, general symptoms, and psychological functioning were assessed before and after treatment, as well as at 4 months after termination of therapy (follow-up). At the end of treatment, 7 patients from the experimental group and 2 from the control group showed significant clinical improvement in 3 of 6 parameters (NS). At follow-up, the improvement was still present in 5 experimental cases but in none of the controls (p = 0.024). Successful patients had been sick for a shorter period of time and were less impaired by their condition. Psychological interventions in combination with physiotherapy can be effective in treating fibromyalgia patients, especially if applied early.
Summary 2: Keel and colleagues found no immediate treatment benefit following 15 weeks of education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exercise vs relaxation training in their small randomized controlled trial.

Query: Does yoga speed healing for patients with low back pain?
Document: The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate a possible design for a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol to study the effects on participants with chronic low back pain. Twenty-two participants (M = 4; F = 17), between the ages of 30 and 65, with chronic low back pain (CLBP) were randomized to either an immediate yoga based intervention, or to a control group with no treatment during the observation period but received later yoga training. A specific CLBP yoga protocol designed and modified for this population by a certified yoga instructor was administered for one hour, twice a week for 6 weeks. Primary functional outcome measures included the forward reach (FR) and sit and reach (SR) tests. All participants completed Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. Guiding questions were used for qualitative data analysis to ascertain how yoga participants perceived the instructor, group dynamics, and the impact of yoga on their life. To account for drop outs, the data were divided into better or not categories, and analyzed using chi-square to examine differences between the groups. Qualitative data were analyzed through frequency of positive responses. Potentially important trends in the functional measurement scores showed improved balance and flexibility and decreased disability and depression for the yoga group but this pilot was not powered to reach statistical significance. Significant limitations included a high dropout rate in the control group and large baseline differences in the secondary measures. In addition, analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following frequency of responses (1) group intervention motivated the participants and (2) yoga fostered relaxation and new awareness/learning. A modified yoga-based intervention may benefit individuals with CLB, but a larger study is necessary to provide definitive evidence. Also, the impact on depression and disability could be considered as important outcomes for further study. Additional functional outcome measures should be explored. This pilot study supports the need for more research investigating the effect of yoga for this population.
Summary:","A randomized controlled trial studied a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol with 22 patients. The yoga group spent an hour with a certified instructor twice weekly, while the control group received the same intervention delayed until the study phase was completed. This underpowered pilot study found trends in functional measurement scores for improved balance and flexibility, as well as decreased disability and depression in the yoga group, but the sample size was too small to detect significant changes."

Query 1: Should we screen women for hypothyroidism?
Document 1: Treatment of hypercholesterolemia can reduce the risk of developing premature atherosclerosis. The hypercholesterolemia caused by hypothyroidism is potentially reversible by thyroid hormone replacement therapy. We determined the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients referred to a university lipid research clinic and studied the changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels on restoration of the euthyroid state. A retrospective follow-up study was performed. In all 1509 consecutive referrals for severe dyslipidemia, thyrotropin levels were measured. Patients with hypothyroidism were identified by means of a computed database, from January 1, 1989, to July 1, 1993, first by levothyroxine sodium medication and second by serum thyrotropin values greater than 5 mU/L. Twenty-one patients were available to evaluate the effect of restoration of the euthyroid state on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. The observed prevalence of hypothyroidism proved to be 4.2% (64/1509). The disorder was previously known in 25 patients and newly diagnosed in 39 patients (11 with overt hypothyroidism and 28 with subclinical hypothyroidism). Significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurred only in patients with pretreatment thyrotropin values of 10 mU/L or more. The prevalence of newly diagnosed cases of overt hypothyroidism in patients referred to a lipid clinic is approximately two times that in the general population. The absence of significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels on levothyroxine treatment in patients with minor subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, < 10 mU/L) does not support the view that this condition is a risk factor for atherosclerosis mediated by an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. All patients referred for diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia should be screened for hypothyroidism by measurement of thyrotropin values.
Summary 1: A retrospective study of 709 women referred to an endocrine clinic for evaluation of abnormal lipoprotein levels identified 34 (4.8%) with undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with initial thyroid-stimulating hormone >10, but not in those with a thyroid-stimulating hormone <10.

Query 2: Should we screen women for hypothyroidism?
Document 2: Increasing use of assays for TSH with improved sensitivity as a first-line test of thyroid function has raised questions regarding prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal results, especially values below normal. We have assessed the thyroid status of 1210 patients aged over 60 registered with a single general practice by measurement of serum TSH using a sensitive assay. High TSH values were more common in females (11.6%) than males (2.9%). TSH values below normal were present in 6.3% of females and 5.5% of males, with values below the limit of detection of the assay present in 1.5% of females and 1.4% of males. Anti-thyroid antibodies were found in 60% of those with high TSH but only 5.6% of those with subnormal TSH. Eighteen patients were hypothyroid (high TSH, low free thyroxine) and one thyrotoxic (low TSH, raised free thyroxine) at initial testing. Seventy-three patients with elevated TSH but normal free T4 were followed for 12 months; 13 (17.8%) developed low free T4 levels and commenced thyroxine, TSH returned to normal in four (5.5%) and 56 (76.7%) continued to have high TSH values. Sixty-six patients with TSH results below normal were followed. Of the 50 subjects with low but detectable TSH at initial testing, 38 (76%) returned to normal at 12 months; of those 16 with undetectable TSH followed, 14 (87.5%) remained low at 12 months. Only one subject (who had an undetectable TSH) developed thyrotoxicosis. In view of the marked prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly, we suggest that screening of all patients over 60 should be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: Among 1210 primary care patients (700 women) aged >60 years, 73 women with subclinical hypothyroidism were identified and followed for 12 months. Of these, 13 (18%) progressed to overt disease.

Query: Should we screen women for hypothyroidism?
Document: In a study at a primary care centre in a predominantly rural area of Sweden the records of all patients with established thyroid disease were scrutinised and 2000 consecutive adult patients screened with an immunoenzymometric thyroid stimulating hormone assay. The aims of the study were fourfold: firstly, to assess the total burden of thyroid disease in primary care centres in Sweden; secondly, to assess the efficacy of clinical diagnosis of the disease in unselected populations of patients; thirdly, to assess the efficacy of clinical evaluation of treatment with thyroxine; and, lastly, to see whether a single analysis of the serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration by recent methods would be enough to identify an abnormality of thyroid function. Of the roughly 17,400 adults in the study community, 111 women and 10 men were being treated for thyroid disease. Screening detected 68 patients (3.5%) not receiving thyroxine who had a serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration of 0.20 mU/l or less, all of whom were followed up clinically. Fifty of these patients were also studied biochemically during follow up. Only nine of the 68 patients had thyroid disease (three with thyrotoxicosis requiring treatment), no evidence of the disease being found in the remainder. Sixteen patients had spontaneous hypothyroidism requiring treatment, and neither these nor three patients with thyrotoxicosis had been detected at the preceding clinical examination. Of 35 patients in whom thyroid disease was suspected clinically at screening, none had laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In this series 1.3% of all women in the study community (2.6% of all 50-59 year olds) and 0.1% of the men were being treated for thyroid disease at the primary care centre, roughly 1.0% of adults subjected to screening were found to have thyroid disease requiring treatment, and most patients with a thyroid stimulating hormone concentration of 0.20 mU/l or less did not have thyroid dysfunction. It is concluded that measuring the basal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration by present methods is insufficient for the biochemical assessment of thyroid dysfunction in unselected populations.
Summary:","In a cohort study, 2000 adults from a primary care population underwent history and physical and TSH testing. The TSH screen identified 19 cases of hypothyroidism not found by history and physical, while the history and physical prompted evaluation of 35 patients without abnormal TSH."

Query 1: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 1: The optimal treatment for mild asthma is uncertain. We assessed the effects of adding a long-acting inhaled beta-agonist, formoterol, to low doses of an inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, for 1 yr in subjects with mild asthma, receiving no or only a small dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The 698 corticosteroid free patients (Group A) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, or placebo. The 1,272 corticosteroid-treated patients (Group B) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, 200 microg budesonide, or 200 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol. The main outcome variables were time to the first severe asthma exacerbation and poorly controlled asthma days. In Group A, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. By contrast, in Group B, adding formoterol reduced the risk for the first severe exacerbation and for poorly controlled days by 43 and 30%, respectively. Thus, in corticosteroid-free patients, low dose inhaled budesonide alone reduced severe exacerbations and improved asthma control, and in patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid, adding formoterol was more effective than doubling the corticosteroid dose.
Summary 1: Evidence does not support use of long-acting beta-agonists as monotherapy or in combination with other medications for children with mild persistent asthma. Although 1 study showed an improvement in lung function for children taking budesonide plus formoterol compared with budesonide alone, the rate of severe exacerbations was lower for those taking budesonide alone (62% decrease vs 55.8% decrease; P=.001). Both groups had a 32% decrease in the number of rescue inhalations per day when compared with placebo (P=.0008).

Query 2: Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma?
Document 2: The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer. We conclude that spacers and nebulizers are equally effective means of delivering beta 2-agonists to children with acute asthma.
Summary 2: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 33 children aged 6 to 14 years showed no difference in metered dose inhaler spacer vs nebulizer, as measured by clinical score, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1). The researchers calculated the study had 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in FEV1 of 12% of the predicted value between the groups.

Query: Is there a role for theophylline in treating patients with asthma?
Document: To determine whether children with severe acute asthma treated with large doses of inhaled salbutamol, inhaled ipratropium, and intravenous steroids are conferred any further benefits by the addition of aminophylline given intravenously. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 163 children admitted to hospital with asthma who were unresponsive to nebulised salbutamol. The placebo and treatment groups of children were similar at baseline. The 48 children in the aminophylline group had a greater improvement in spirometry at six hours and a higher oxygen saturation in the first 30 hours. Five subjects in the placebo group were intubated and ventilated after enrollment compared with none in the aminophylline group. Aminophylline continues to have a place in the management of severe acute asthma in children unresponsive to initial treatment.
Summary:",The largest RCT of aminophylline in children demonstrated a reduced intubation rate (NNT = 14 CI: 7.8-77). Children receiving aminophylline experienced more vomiting (RR = 3.69; 95%CI: 2.15-6.33).

Query 2: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 2: Anti-leukotrienes agents are currently being studied as alternative first line agents to inhaled corticosteroids in mild to moderate chronic asthma. To compare the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotriene agents with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and to determine the dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes to daily dose of ICS. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Aug 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Aug 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Aug 2003), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2003), abstract books, and reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers. Randomised controlled trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids during a minimal 30-day intervention period in asthmatic patients aged 2 years and older. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality or trials and extracted trial data. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included lung function, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects and withdrawal rates. 27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration varied from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Twenty six (95% CI: 17 to 47) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra exacerbation. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes where()the improvement in FEV(1) reached 130 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL ]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Twenty nine (95% CI 20 to 48) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not different between groups. Inhaled steroids at a dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent are more effective than anti-leukotriene agents given in the usual licensed doses. The exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotriene agents in mcg of ICS remains to be determined. Inhaled glucocorticoids should remain the first line monotherapy for persistent asthma.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 15 trials reported that the protective effect of leukotriene receptor antagonists is inferior to inhaled corticosteroids for adults (relative risk [RR]=1.71; 95% CI, 1.40-2.09); however, evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to children.

Query: Is there a role for theophylline in treating patients with asthma?
Document: Inhaled glucosteroids and oral theophylline are widely used to treat asthma. We compared the benefits of adding theophylline to inhaled glucosteroid with those of doubling the dose of inhaled glucosteroid in patients with persistent symptoms despite the use of inhaled glucosteroid. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 62 patients to receive either 400 microg of inhaled budesonide (low-dose budesonide) with 250 or 375 mg of theophylline (depending on body weight) or 800 microg of inhaled budesonide (high-dose budesonide). All doses were given twice daily for three months. Lung function was measured serially, and patients kept records of peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and albuterol use. The effects of treatment on endogenous cortisol levels were also assessed. Both treatments resulted in improvements in lung function that were sustained throughout the study. As compared with treatment with high-dose budesonide, treatment with low-dose budesonide plus theophylline resulted in greater improvements in forced vital capacity (P=0.03) and forced expiratory volume in one second (P= 0.03). There were significant and similar reductions in beta2-agonist use and the variability of peak expiratory flow, a correlate of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the severity of asthma. Serum cortisol concentrations were significantly reduced in the group given high-dose budesonide (from a mean [+/-SE] of 18.4+/-2.4 microg per deciliter to 15.9+/-2.1 microg per deciliter, P=0.02) but were unchanged in the other group. The median serum theophylline concentration was 8.7 microg per milliliter (therapeutic range, 10 to 20) among those who received theophylline. Both treatments were well tolerated. For patients with moderate asthma and persistent symptoms, low-dose inhaled budesonide with theophylline and high-dose inhaled budesonide produced similar benefits. Effects were achieved at theophylline concentrations below the recommended therapeutic range. The addition of low-dose theophylline to inhaled glucosteroid may be preferable to and cheaper than increasing the dose of inhaled glucosteroid.
Summary:","When added to low-dose ICS for maintenance, theophylline was as effective as high-dose ICS alone in improving FEV 1 , decreasing day and night symptoms, and reducing the need for rescue medications and the incidence of attacks. This suggests theophylline has utility as a steroid sparing agent."

Query 1: Are any oral iron formulations better tolerated than ferrous sulfate?
Document 1: Absolute iron deficiency is treated by correcting the causative lesion and then, traditionally, administering sufficient amounts of ferrous salt to return the haemoglobin level to normal and replenish body stores. The bioavailability of ferric compounds has been questioned and accordingly their therapeutic role remains controversial. A special problem is posed by regular blood donation, where the frequency of phlebotomy is limited by the haemoglobin level, which, in turn, requires maintenance of an adequate supply of iron from dietary sources. Since this latter situation may not always occur, it would be of practical benefit to have a form of supplementation that is effective and can be taken without side effects. These issues were prospectively examined in a consecutive series of otherwise healthy blood donors who developed absolute iron deficiency anaemia and were then randomly allocated to receive 60 mg of this metal as ferrous sulphate twice a day (Group 1: n = 51), 100 mg as chewable ferric polymaltose daily (Group 2: n = 53), or the latter product twice a day (Group 3: n = 55). Serial studies showed that 80% of patients in Groups 1 and 3 had reached normal haemoglobin levels by 12 weeks, but this figure was only 50% in Group 2. Similarly, the proportion of patients improving their percentage saturation of transferrin to within the normal range was significantly better in Groups 1 and 3 than in Group 2 (P < .01). However, body iron stores, reflected in serum ferritin level, was significantly better in Group 1 (P < .01); there was no difference in this respect between Groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 1: A study of 159 subjects found fewer subjects discontinuing the polysaccharide-iron complex taken with meals than ferrous sulfate taken on an empty stomach.

Query 2: What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children?
Document 2: Adherence to treatment of iron-deficiency anemia often is poor in both developed and developing countries. The current standard therapy is ferrous sulfate drops (or syrup) administered 3 times daily. It is possible that adherence would improve with a single-dose daily treatment regimen. We compared the use of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops, at the same total iron dose, on treatment of anemia in infants. To obtain a large enough cohort of anemic subjects, we performed the study in rural Ghana. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled design, we studied 557 anemic children (age range: 6-24 months; hemoglobin values: 70-99 g/L). One group (n = 280) received ferrous sulfate drops once daily (40 mg elemental iron), and the control group (n = 277) received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times per day (total dose, 40 mg elemental iron). Treatment lasted for 2 months. Hemoglobin and serum ferritin values were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin >100 g/L) occurred in 61% of the single-dose and in 56% of the 3-times-daily group. Geometric mean ferritin levels increased significantly in each group from baseline to the final visit. Side effects were minimal and similar between the 2 groups. A single versus a 3-times-daily dose of ferrous sulfate drops over 2 months resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia, without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of a single-dose daily regimen to treat anemia. Although not examined in the current study, use of a single-dose daily regimen may improve adherence to treatment of anemia in infants.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials of 557 anemic children under 24 months of age in Ghana demonstrated that ferrous sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) given once daily was equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing in terms of effectiveness (61% vs 56%) and tolerance. Less frequent dosing has been studied in developing countries with mixed results.

Query: Are any oral iron formulations better tolerated than ferrous sulfate?
Document: The effectiveness of orally administered iron was investigated using three different iron preparations in a randomized study with 3 patient groups, each consisting of 20 subjects with iron deficiency anaemia. Group A received a ferric(III)-dextrin complex, group B Fe(II)-sulfate, and group C Fe(II)-fumarate with vitamins. For all three preparations the increase in the number of erythrocytes as well as hemoglobin and hematocrit values ran absolutely parallel for a period of 12 weeks. A relevant difference between the trivalent ferric-dextrin complex and the two bivalent iron preparations could not be detected on evaluation of the parameters measured except for a moderate increase in the transaminase values in the patients group who received the Fe(II)-sulfate preparation. No differences were found among the preparations with respect to tolerance. The results are discussed with respect to a possible overloading of the iron transport system by highly absorptive Fe(II)-preparations.
Summary:",A study of 60 subjects taking both preparations on an empty stomach found no difference in side-effect rates.

Query 1: Other than anticoagulation, what is the best therapy for those with atrial fibrillation?
Document 1: There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended. We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. A total of 4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic. Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.
Summary 1: The AFFIRM trial, the largest (n=4060), was a nonblinded, randomized, multicenter study with an average follow-up of 3.5 years. The patients were aged 65 years or older and had at least 1 other risk factor for stroke. The rhythm-control group was given an antiarrhythmic medication chosen by the treating physician, while the rate-control group was given either a beta-blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, digoxin, or a combination of these as needed. Heart-rate goals were a resting pulse under 80 beats per minute, and a pulse after a 6-minute walk under 110 beats per minute. An intention-totreat analysis was followed. There was no difference between the 2 groups for the composite endpoints of death, disabling stroke, disabling anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest. A nonsignificant trend was observed for mortality favoring the rate-control group (relative risk [RR]=1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.34). Quality-of-life measures were equivalent in the 2 groups at all points in the study.

Query 2: What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension?
Document 2: Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit. To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality. We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls. Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common. Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63-0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77-0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments. Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.
Summary 2: Several other clinical trials have subsequently compared the effect of thiazide diuretics with that of other antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers) on patient-oriented outcomes. These were analyzed in a recent meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials that included 192,478 patients randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo.

Query: Other than anticoagulation, what is the best therapy for those with atrial fibrillation?
Document: This review summarizes the available evidence regarding the efficacy of medications used for ventricular rate control, stroke prevention, acute conversion, and maintenance of sinus rhythm, as well as the efficacy of electrical cardioversion and the use of echocardiography in patients with atrial fibrillation. The Cochrane Collaboration's database of controlled clinical trials and MEDLINE. Primarily randomized, controlled trials of medications. Paired reviewers obtained data on efficacy and safety. Strength of evidence was assessed. Recent clinical trial results showed that most patients with atrial fibrillation have similar outcomes with strategies for controlling ventricular rate compared with strategies for restoring sinus rhythm. For efficacy of primary stroke prevention, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for warfarin and suggestive for aspirin. The evidence for an increased risk for major bleeding was suggestive for warfarin and inconclusive for aspirin. For ventricular rate control, verapamil, diltiazem, atenolol, and metoprolol were qualitatively superior to digoxin and placebo, particularly during exercise. For efficacy of acute conversion, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, amiodarone, and quinidine. For efficacy of maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion from atrial fibrillation, evidence was strong for amiodarone, propafenone, disopyramide, and sotalol. Echocardiography was found to be useful in estimating risk for thromboembolism and potentially useful in estimating likelihood of successful cardioversion and maintenance. For several key questions in the pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation, strong evidence exists to support 1 or more treatment options.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 60 RCTs evaluated 8 drugs for acute cardioversion. Ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, and amiodarone were found to have the strongest evidence of efficacy. There was moderate evidence for quinidine and insufficient evidence for disopyramide and sotalol. Studies of pharmacologic conversion suffer from small ample size, short follow-up, and variable duration of atrial fibrillation. A review of limited research reveals an 80% to 85% immediate success rate for DC cardioversion, with rare side-effects of ventricular tachycardia, transient AV node dysfunction, and significant skin blistering."

Query 1: What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear?
Document 1: To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newer diagnostic imaging tests as an addition to clinical examination and patient history for the diagnosis of soft tissue shoulder disorders. Literature was identified from several sources including general medical databases. Studies were identified that evaluated clinical examination, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in patients suspected of having soft tissue shoulder disorders. Outcomes assessed were clinical impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tear (full, partial or any). Only cohort studies were included. The methodological quality of included test accuracy studies was assessed using a formal quality assessment tool for diagnostic studies and the extraction of study findings was conducted in duplicate using a pre-designed and piloted data extraction form to avoid any errors. For each test, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each study. Where possible pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated using random effects methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by conducting subgroup analyses. In the included studies, the prevalence of rotator cuff disorders was generally high, partial verification of patients was common and in many cases patients who were selected retrospectively because they had undergone the reference test. Sample sizes were generally very small. Reference tests were often inappropriate with many studies using arthrography alone, despite problems with its sensitivity. For clinical assessment, 10 cohort studies were found that examined either the accuracy of individual tests or clinical examination as a whole: individual tests were either good at ruling out rotator cuff tears when negative (high sensitivity) or at ruling in such disorders when positive (high specificity), but small sample sizes meant that there was no conclusive evidence. Ultrasound was investigated in 38 cohort studies and found to be most accurate when used for the detection of full-thickness tears; sensitivity was lower for detection of partial-thickness tears. For MRI, 29 cohort studies were included. For full-thickness tears, overall pooled sensitivities and specificities were fairly high and the studies were not statistically heterogeneous; however for the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, the pooled sensitivity estimate was much lower. The results from six MRA studies suggested that it may be very accurate for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although its performance for the detection of partial-thickness tears was less consistent. Direct evidence for the performance of one test compared with another is very limited. The results suggest that clinical examination by specialists can rule out the presence of a rotator cuff tear, and that either MRI or ultrasound could equally be used for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although ultrasound may be better at picking up partial tears. Ultrasound also may be more cost-effective in a specialist hospital setting for identification of full-thickness tears. Further research suggestions include the need for large, well-designed, prospective studies of the diagnosis of shoulder pain, in particular a follow-up study of patients with shoulder pain in primary care and a prospective cohort study of clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI, alone and/or in combination.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies found the overall sensitivity and specificity of a clinical exam to rule out a full-thickness rotator cuff tear to be 0.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.47-0.61). However, no single physical exam finding provided comparable accuracy.

In these studies, diagnosis of partial-thickness tears with magnetic resonance arthrography was inconsistent. The invasiveness of magnetic resonance arthrography limits its utility as compared with magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound.

For partial-thickness tears, ultrasound sensitivity was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.73). Positive and negative predictive values of a test depend on the prevalence of the condition in the study population. In the case of rotator cuff tears, such differences in prevalence of rotator cuff tears in the 38 cohort studies left it unclear whether a negative ultrasound could reliably rule out a tear."

Query 1: What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children?
Document 1: Two groups of infants, one fed whole cow milk commencing at 6 months of age (n = 69) and the other continuing to receive iron-fortified infant formula (n = 98), were closely observed over their second 6 months of life. At 12 months of age, infants fed cow milk had significantly lower mean serum ferritin levels and mean corpuscular volume, higher free erythrocyte protoporphyrin values, and greater incidence of hemoglobin values less than 11 g/dl than did formula-fed infants. There were no significant differences in frequency of otitis media, wheezing episodes, nasal discharge or congestion, diaper dermatitis, constipation, guaiac-positive stools, or hospital admissions between the two groups. These data suggest that, to avoid iron deficiency, infants should continue to receive iron-fortified formula throughout the first year of life or a daily iron supplement if they are fed whole cow milk before their first birthday.
Summary 1: In a cohort study, infants given iron-fortified formula (n=98) were less likely to become iron-deficient by their 12-month visit than infants fed whole cow milk (n=69) (11.2% vs 24.6%, number needed to treat [NNT]=8).

Query 2: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 2: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in infants worldwide. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation for 3 months to improve the iron status in 4-month-old, exclusively breast-fed healthy infants. Infants 4 months of age were eligible for the open, randomized controlled trial if their mothers intended to continue exclusive breast-feeding until the infants were 6 months of age. Infants or mothers with iron deficiency (ID) or IDA on admission were excluded. The infants (n = 79) were randomly assigned to three groups, the first group receiving daily (1 mg/kg daily), the second group weekly (7 mg/kg weekly), and the third group no iron supplementation. Anthropometric measurements were taken on admission and at 6 and 7 months of age. Iron status was analyzed on admission and monthly for 3 months. Both hematologic parameters and anthropometric measurements were found to be similar among the three groups during the study period. Seven infants (31.8%) in the control group, six (26.0%) in the daily group, and three (13.6%) in the weekly group developed ID or IDA (P > 0.05). Infants whose mothers had ID or IDA during the study period were more likely to develop ID or IDA independently from iron supplementation. Serum ferritin levels decreased between 4 and 6 months of age in the control and daily groups; the weekly group showed no such decrease. In all groups, the mean levels of serum ferritin were significantly increased from 6 months to 7 months of age during the weaning period. In this study, which had a limited number of cases, weekly or daily iron supplementation was not found to decrease the likelihood of IDA. In conclusion, exclusively breast-fed infants with maternal IDA appeared to be at increased risk of developing IDA.
Summary 2: A randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation on iron status in 67 exclusively breastfed infants. At age 4 months the infants were randomized into 3 groups: daily iron, weekly iron, and no iron. No significant differences were detected in the mean weight, height, and head circumference among the groups. The mean values of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, and transferrin saturation were similar among all the groups at ages 5, 6, and 7 months.

Query: What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children?
Document: To compare the effect of unmodified cows' milk and iron supplemented formula milk on psychomotor development in infants from inner city areas when used as the main milk source. Double blind, randomised intervention trial. Birmingham health centre. 100 infants, mean age 7.8 months (range 5.7 to 8.6 months), whose mothers had already elected to use unmodified cows' milk as their infant's milk source. Changing to an iron supplemented formula milk from enrolment to 18 months of age, or continuing with unmodified cows' milk. Developmental assessments using Griffiths scales at enrolment and at 18 and 24 months. 85 participants completed the trial. There were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration between the two groups at enrolment, but by 18 months of age 33% of the unmodified cows' milk group, but only 2% of the iron supplemented group, were anaemic (P<0.001). The experimental groups had Griffiths general quotient scores that were not significantly different at enrolment, but the scores in both groups declined during the study. By 24 months the decrease in the mean scores in the unmodified cows' milk group was 14.7 whereas the decrease in the mean scores in the iron supplemented group was 9.3 (P<0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 10.4). Mean subquotient scores were considerably lower in the unmodified cows' milk group at 24 months; significantly so for personal and social scores (P<0.02, 1.2 to 16.8 [corrected]). Replacing unmodified cows' milk with an iron supplemented formula milk up to 18 months of age in infants from inner city areas prevents iron deficiency anaemia and reduces the decline in psychomotor development seen in such infants from the second half of the first year.
Summary:","In a RCT of innercity children who had been switched to cow's milk by 6 months, half (n=50) were randomized to receive iron-fortified formula for another year, resulting in a decreased risk of anemia at 24 months (0% vs 26%, NNT=4), and smaller declines in developmental functioning compared with those on cow's milk."

Query 2: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 2: Reports of hypovitaminosis D among adults in the United States have drawn attention to the vitamin D status of children. National data on hypovitaminosis D among children are not yet available. Reports from 2000 and 2001 of rickets among children living in North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and the mid-Atlantic region, however, confirmed the presence of vitamin D deficiency among some US children and prompted new clinical guidelines to prevent its occurrence. We reviewed reports of nutritional rickets among US children <18 y of age that were published between 1986 and 2003. We identified 166 cases of rickets in 22 published studies. Patients were 4-54 mo of age, although in 17 studies the maximal age was <30 mo. Approximately 83% of children with rickets were described as African American or black, and 96% were breast-fed. Among children who were breast-fed, only 5% of records indicated vitamin D supplementation during breast-feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently recommended a minimal intake of 200 IU/d vitamin D for all infants, beginning in the first 2 mo of life. AAP recommends a vitamin D supplement for breast-fed infants who do not consume at least 500 mL of a vitamin D-fortified beverage. Given our finding of a disproportionate number of rickets cases among young, breast-fed, black children, we recommend that education regarding AAP guidelines emphasize the higher risk of rickets among these children. Education should also emphasize the importance of weaning children to a diet adequate in both vitamin D and calcium.
Summary 2: Among the 166 published cases of rickets in the US from 1986 to 2003, 83% were categorized as African American or black. Ninety-six percent of cases were breastfed.

Query: What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children?
Document: The pediatrician is faced with a difficult challenge in providing recommendations for optimal nutrition in older infants. Because the milk (or formula) portion of the diet represents 35% to 100% of total daily calories and because WCM and breast milk or infant formula differ markedly in composition, the selection of a milk or formula has a great impact on nutrient intake. Infants fed WCM have low intakes of iron, linoleic acid, and vitamin E, and excessive intakes of sodium, potassium, and protein, illustrating the poor nutritional compatibility of solid foods and WCM. These nutrient intakes are not optimal and may result in altered nutritional status, with the most dramatic effect on iron status. Infants fed iron-fortified formula or breast milk for the first 12 months of life generally maintain normal iron status. No studies have concluded that the introduction of WCM into the diet at 6 months of age produces adequate iron status in later infancy; however, recent studies have demonstrated that iron status is significantly impaired when WCM is introduced into the diet of 6-month-old infants. Data from studies abroad of highly iron-deficient infant populations suggest that infants fed partially modified milk formulas with supplemental iron in a highly bioavailable form (ferrous sulfate) may maintain adequate iron status. However, these studies do not address the overall nutritional adequacy of the infant's diet. Such formulas have not been studied in the United States. Optimal nutrition of the infant involves selecting the appropriate milk source and eventually introducing infant solid foods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary:",The AAP recommends that parents should refrain from feeding cow's milk to infants until after age 12 months and introduce iron-enriched foods between ages 4 and 6 months.

Query 1: What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy?
Document 1: Clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombotic disease in the CAPRIE study and its benefit was amplified in some high-risk subgroups of patients. We aimed to assess whether addition of aspirin to clopidogrel could have a greater benefit than clopidogrel alone in prevention of vascular events with potentially higher bleeding risk. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare aspirin (75 mg/day) with placebo in 7599 high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and at least one additional vascular risk factor who were already receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day. Duration of treatment and follow-up was 18 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death, or rehospitalisation for acute ischaemia (including rehospitalisation for transient ischaemic attack, angina pectoris, or worsening of peripheral arterial disease). Analysis was by intention to treat, using logrank test and a Cox's proportional-hazards model. 596 (15.7%) patients reached the primary endpoint in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel compared with 636 (16.7%) in the clopidogrel alone group (relative risk reduction 6.4%, [95% CI -4.6 to 16.3]; absolute risk reduction 1% [-0.6 to 2.7]). Life-threatening bleedings were higher in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone (96 [2.6%] vs 49 [1.3%]; absolute risk increase 1.3% [95% CI 0.6 to 1.9]). Major bleedings were also increased in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel but no difference was recorded in mortality. Adding aspirin to clopidogrel in high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack is associated with a non-significant difference in reducing major vascular events. However, the risk of life-threatening or major bleeding is increased by the addition of aspirin.
Summary 1: A large-scale randomized controlled trials concluded that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin did not provide additional benefit in reducing a combined endpoint of cardioembolic events in comparison with aspirin alone for patients with prior stroke or TIA. The combination resulted in a significantly greater number of life-threatening and major bleeding complications.

Query 2: What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy?
Document 2: Many clinical trials have evaluated the benefit of long-term use of antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of clinical thrombotic events. Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate. CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years. 19,185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5.32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5.83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statistically significant (p = 0.043) relative-risk reduction of 8.7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% Cl 0.3-16.5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9.4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0.26% vs 0.10%), diarrhoea (0.23% vs 0.11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0.97% vs 1.22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0.33% vs 0.47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0.52% vs 0.72%), respectively. There were ten (0.10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (< 1.2 x 10(9)/L) and 16 (0.17%) in the aspirin group. Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety profile of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of medium-dose aspirin.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials comparing clopidogrel with aspirin found a nonsignificant risk reduction of 0.3% (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.9; P=.26) in occurrence of stroke when compared with aspirin for patients with previous stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial disease. A 0.9% absolute reduction in combined risk of cardioembolic events was reported for patients randomized to clopidogrel (NNT=111; 95% CI, 57-2454; P=.043), but patients with TIA were excluded from the study population.

Query: What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy?
Document: In 1988, we undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), modified-release dipyridamole, and the two agents in combination for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomized to treatment with ASA alone (50 mg daily), modified-release dipyridamole alone (400 mg daily), the two agents in a combined formulation, or placebo. Primary endpoints were stroke, death, and stroke or death together. TIA and other vascular events were secondary endpoints. Patients were followed on treatment for two years. Data from 6,602 patients were analysed. Factorial analysis demonstrated a highly significant effect for ASA and for dipyridamole in reducing the risk of stroke (p < or = 0.001) and stroke or death combined (p < 0.01). In pairwise comparisons, stroke risk in comparison to placebo was reduced by 18% with ASA alone (p = 0.013); 16% with dipyridamole alone (p = 0.039); and 37% with combination therapy (p < 0.001). Risk of stroke or death was reduced by 13% with ASA alone (p = 0.016); 15% with dipyridamole alone (p = 0.015); and 24% with the combination (p < 0.001). The treatment had no statistically significant effect on the death rate alone. Factorial analysis also demonstrated a highly significant effect of ASA (p < 0.001) and dipyridamole (p < 0.01) for preventing TIA. The risk reduction for the combination was 36% (p < 0.001) in comparison with placebo. Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring more frequently in dipyridamole-treated patients. All-site bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding were significantly more common in patients who received ASA in comparison to placebo or dipyridamole. We conclude that (1) ASA 25 mg twice daily and dipyridamole, in a modified-release form, at a dose of 200 mg twice daily have each been shown to be equally effective for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and TIA; (2) when co-prescribed the protective effects are additive, the combination being significantly more effective than either agent prescribed singly; (3) low-dose ASA does not eliminate the propensity for induced bleeding.
Summary:","A large-scale RCT including patients with previous stroke or TIA concluded that the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the occurrence of stroke by 23% (P<.001) compared with aspirin (number needed to treat [NNT]=35; 95% CI, 20-130). In this trial, patients with a prior TIA comprised only one quarter of the patients studied. Subgroup analyses of patients on aspirin prior to experiencing a TIA have not been reported."

Query 1: When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement?
Document 1: Only limited data on the rate of hemodynamic progression and predictors of outcome in asymptomatic patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS) are available. In 123 adults (mean age, 63 +/- 16 years) with asymptomatic AS, annual clinical, echocardiographic, and exercise data were obtained prospectively (mean follow-up of 2.5 +/- 1.4 years). Aortic jet velocity increased by 0.32 +/- 0.34 m/s per year and mean gradient by 7 +/- 7 mm Hg per year; valve area decreased by 0.12 +/- 0.19 cm2 per year. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival, with end points defined as death (n = 8) or aortic valve surgery (n = 48), was 93 +/- 5% at 1 year, 62 +/- 8% at 3 years, and 26 +/- 10% at 5 years. Univariate predictors of outcome included baseline jet velocity, mean gradient, valve area, and the rate of increase in jet velocity (all P < or = .001) but not age, sex, or cause of AS. Those with an end point had a smaller exercise increase in valve area, blood pressure, and cardiac output and a greater exercise decrease in stroke volume. Multivariate predictors of outcome were jet velocity at baseline (P < .0001), the rate of change in jet velocity (P < .0001), and functional status score (P = .002). The likelihood of remaining alive without valve replacement at 2 years was only 21 +/- 18% for a jet velocity at entry > 4.0 m/s, compared with 66 +/- 13% for a velocity of 3.0 to 4.0 m/s and 84 +/- 16% for a jet velocity < 3.0 m/s (P < .0001). In adults with asymptomatic AS, the rate of hemodynamic progression and clinical outcome are predicted by jet velocity, the rate of change in jet velocity, and functional status.
Summary 1: In one prospective study of 123 patients, those who had a greater increase in valve area, cardiac output, and blood pressure and a smaller decrease in stroke volume on stress echocardiogram were more likely to remain asymptomatic for the entire length of their time in the study, an average of 2.5 years.

In adults with asymptomatic AS, the rate of hemodynamic progression and clinical outcome are predicted by jet velocity, the rate of change in jet velocity, and functional status.
Summary 2: One prospective study found the severity of stenosis at baseline to be the strongest prognostic predictor. Patients with a jet velocity of < 3.0 m/s were unlikely to develop symptoms within 5 years; those with a jet velocity of 4.0 m/s had a > 50% likelihood of developing symptoms or dying within 2 years.

Query: When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement?
Document: Whether to perform valve replacement in patients with asymptomatic but severe aortic stenosis is controversial. Therefore, we studied the natural history of this condition to identify predictors of outcome. During 1994, we identified 128 consecutive patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (59 women and 69 men; mean [+/-SD] age, 60+/-18 years; aortic-jet velocity, 5.0+/-0.6 m per second). The patients were prospectively followed until 1998. Follow-up information was available for 126 patients (98 percent) for a mean of 22+/-18 months. Event-free survival, with the end point defined as death (8 patients) or valve replacement necessitated by the development of symptoms (59 patients), was 67+/-5 percent at one year, 56+/-5 percent at two years, and 33+/-5 percent at four years. Five of the six deaths from cardiac disease were preceded by symptoms. According to multivariate analysis, only the extent of aortic-valve calcification was an independent predictor of outcome, whereas age, sex, and the presence or absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia were not. Event-free survival for patients with no or mild valvular calcification was 92+/-5 percent at one year, 84+/-8 percent at two years, and 75+/-9 percent at four years, as compared with 60+/-6 percent, 47+/-6 percent, and 20+/-5 percent, respectively, for those with moderate or severe calcification. The rate of progression of stenosis, as reflected by the aortic-jet velocity, was significantly higher in patients who had cardiac events (0.45+/-0.38 m per second per year) than those who did not have cardiac events (0.14+/-0.18 m per second per year, P<0.001), and the rate of progression of stenosis provided useful prognostic information. Of the patients with moderately or severely calcified aortic valves whose aortic-jet velocity increased by 0.3 m per second or more within one year, 79 percent underwent surgery or died within two years of the observed increase. In asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis, it appears to be relatively safe to delay surgery until symptoms develop. However, outcomes vary widely. The presence of moderate or severe valvular calcification, together with a rapid increase in aortic-jet velocity, identifies patients with a very poor prognosis. These patients should be considered for early valve replacement rather than have surgery delayed until symptoms develop.
Summary:",A study followed 128 patients for 4 years and found that moderate to severe valvular calcification and an increase in jet velocity of 0.3 m/s/year were the best prognostic predictors. Almost 80% of those with both calcification and a rapid change in jet velocity underwent surgery or died within 2 years.

Query 1: Should liver enzymes be checked in a patient taking niacin?
Document 1: To compare escalating doses of immediate-release (IR) and sustained-release (SR) niacin for effectiveness in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and for the occurrence of adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity. Randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of IR and SR niacin administered sequentially at 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mg/d, each for 6 weeks. Cholesterol research center. Forty-six adults, 23 in each group, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) after 1 month of a step 1 National Cholesterol Education Program diet. Fourteen-hour fasting lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, results of clinical laboratory tests, a symptom questionnaire, and withdrawal rates. The SR niacin lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than IR niacin did at the dosage of 1500 mg/d and above, while IR niacin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than SR niacin did at all dosage levels. The reduction in triglyceride levels was similar with IR and SR niacin. Nine (39%) of the 23 patients assigned to the IR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were vasodilatory symptoms, fatigue, and acanthosis nigricans. Eighteen (78%) of the 23 patients assigned to the SR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were gastrointestinal tract symptoms, fatigue, and increases in levels of liver aminotransferases, often with symptoms of hepatic dysfunction. None of the patients taking IR niacin developed hepatotoxic effects, while 12 (52%) of the 23 patients taking SR niacin did. The SR form of niacin is hepatotoxic and should be restricted from use. The IR niacin is preferred for the management of hypercholesterolemia but can also cause significant adverse effects and should be given only to patients who can be carefully monitored by experienced health professionals.
Summary 1: american society of health-system pharmacists recommend more frequent monitoring for high-risk patients-risks include doses >2 g/d for LA/SR and >3 g/d for IR; LA/SR formulations; switching between formulations; taking concomitant drugs that interact ie, sulfonylureas; excessive alcohol use undefined; and preexisting liver disease based on a bivariate analysis of factors associated with increased risk of hepatic toxicity from a single retrospective cohort study.

Query 2: Should liver enzymes be checked in a patient taking niacin?
Document 2: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of controlled-release niacin in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia. A retrospective cohort study. A Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. A consecutive sample of 969 predominantly elderly male veterans treated for dyslipoproteinemia with controlled-release niacin between October 1988 and October 1991. Primary outcomes were lipid levels and lipoprotein cholesterol response, alternations in levels of hepatic enzymes and blood chemistry test results, and characterization of niacin-induced hepatotoxicity abstracted from the patient's medical, laboratory, and pharmacy records. 93% (896 of 969) of the cohort was evaluable. Patients (age, 61.7 years [9.4 years], mean [SD]) were treated for 1 to 36 months (13.0 months [9.7 months]) with an average maintenance dose of 1.67 g/d (0.8 g/d). Niacin was discontinued in 48.5% (435 of 896) of the patients primarily because of adverse effects. Poor glycemic control led to discontinuation in 40.6% (43 of 106) of the patients with diabetes mellitus. The lipoprotein response was dose-related and favorable (levels of total cholesterol, -19.1%; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -24.0%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +5.7%; and triglycerides, -32.5%). Statistically but not clinically meaningful dose-related increases were seen in levels of liver enzymes and serum glucose (aspartate aminotransferase, +29%; alanine aminotransferase, +23%; alkaline phosphatase, +25%; and glucose, +7%; P = 0.0001). Twenty of 896 (2.2%) and 42 of 896 (4.7%) patients met biochemical criteria for probable and for possible or probable niacin-induced hepatotoxicity, respectively. Predisposing factors included high dose, alcohol use, preexisting liver disease, and concurrent oral sulfonylurea therapy. Controlled-release niacin is effective in treating dyslipoproteinemia in selected middle-aged and elderly veterans, but approximately one half of patients discontinued the drug because of adverse effects or other causes including noncompliance. Niacin should be avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction or a history of liver disease, patients with diabetes mellitus, and patients who abuse alcohol. Because controlled-release niacin seems to be more potent than crystalline niacin, product substitution without dose adjustment should be avoided.
Summary 2: In a retrospective cohort of 969 veterans taking LA/SR niacin, those who developed hepatotoxicity had onset between 1 and 28 months of initiating treatment.

In this study, patients receiving 1 g/d of LA/SR niacin had increases in transaminases similar to those of patients on 3 g/d of IR niacin. It is therefore recommended that if a patient cannot tolerate IR niacin and is switched to the LA/SR form, the dosage be reduced by 50% to 70%. At doses >2 g/d of LA/SR niacin, mean transaminases approached 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), supporting recommendations not to exceed this dose for LA/SR niacin."

Query 1: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 1: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in infants worldwide. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation for 3 months to improve the iron status in 4-month-old, exclusively breast-fed healthy infants. Infants 4 months of age were eligible for the open, randomized controlled trial if their mothers intended to continue exclusive breast-feeding until the infants were 6 months of age. Infants or mothers with iron deficiency (ID) or IDA on admission were excluded. The infants (n = 79) were randomly assigned to three groups, the first group receiving daily (1 mg/kg daily), the second group weekly (7 mg/kg weekly), and the third group no iron supplementation. Anthropometric measurements were taken on admission and at 6 and 7 months of age. Iron status was analyzed on admission and monthly for 3 months. Both hematologic parameters and anthropometric measurements were found to be similar among the three groups during the study period. Seven infants (31.8%) in the control group, six (26.0%) in the daily group, and three (13.6%) in the weekly group developed ID or IDA (P > 0.05). Infants whose mothers had ID or IDA during the study period were more likely to develop ID or IDA independently from iron supplementation. Serum ferritin levels decreased between 4 and 6 months of age in the control and daily groups; the weekly group showed no such decrease. In all groups, the mean levels of serum ferritin were significantly increased from 6 months to 7 months of age during the weaning period. In this study, which had a limited number of cases, weekly or daily iron supplementation was not found to decrease the likelihood of IDA. In conclusion, exclusively breast-fed infants with maternal IDA appeared to be at increased risk of developing IDA.
Summary 1: A randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation on iron status in 67 exclusively breastfed infants. At age 4 months the infants were randomized into 3 groups: daily iron, weekly iron, and no iron. No significant differences were detected in the mean weight, height, and head circumference among the groups. The mean values of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, and transferrin saturation were similar among all the groups at ages 5, 6, and 7 months.

Query 2: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 2: The aim of this study is to evaluate the iron nutritional status of infants breast-fed exclusively and for a prolonged period in relation to their growth rate and dietary changes. Forty subjects (25 breast-fed; 15 formula-fed) were studied from 0 to 9 months of age. Milk (human or formula) was the only source of food during the first 6 months. From the sixth month onward mothers were instructed to use iron- and ascorbic acid-rich foods to supplement breast-feeding. At the ninth month, prevalence of anemia was 27.8% in the breast-fed group and 7.1% in the formula-fed group. Storage iron was absent in 27.8% of the breast-fed infants vs none of the formula-fed infants. These findings reinforce the recommendation that breast-fed infants be given supplemental iron from the fourth month of life.
Summary 2: The iron status of exclusively breastfed infants vs formula-fed infants was evaluated in a nonrandomized cohort study. Twenty-five healthy, breastfed infants and 15 healthy infants fed high-iron formula were followed for 9 months. No differences in mean hemoglobin values were seen at any age between the 2 groups.

Query: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document: Iron supplements are often prescribed during infancy but their benefits and risks have not been well documented. We examined whether iron supplements affect growth or morbidity of breast-fed infants. Full-term infants in Sweden (n = 101) and Honduras (n = 131) were randomly assigned to three groups at 4 mo of age: 1) placebo from 4 to 9 mo; 2) placebo from 4 to 6 mo and iron supplements [1 mg/(kg. d)] from 6 to 9 mo; or 3) iron supplements from 4 to 9 mo. All infants were exclusively or nearly exclusively breast-fed to 6 mo and continued to be breast-fed to at least 9 mo. Growth was measured monthly and morbidity data were collected every 2 wk. Among the Swedish infants, gains in length and head circumference were significantly lower in those who received iron than in those given placebo from 4 to 9 mo. The same effect on length was seen in Honduras, but only at 4-6 mo among those with initial hemoglobin (Hb) > or =110 g/L. There was no significant main effect of iron supplementation on morbidity, nor any significant interaction between iron supplementation and site, but for diarrhea (with both sites combined), there was an interaction between iron supplementation and initial Hb. Among infants with Hb < 110 g/L at 4 mo, diarrhea was less common among those given iron than in those given placebo from 4-9 mo, whereas the opposite was true among those with Hb > or = 110 g/L (P < 0.05). We conclude that routine iron supplementation of breast-fed infants may benefit those with low Hb but may present risks for those with normal Hb.
Summary:","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled iron supplementation trial involved 214 exclusively breastfed infants from 4 to 9 months of age in Sweden and Honduras. Iron supplementation did not affect weight gain in the groups, but length gain from ages 4 to 9 months was less in the iron-supplemented groups than in the placebo group (P<.05 for placebo vs Fe). This effect was greater in Sweden, and only existed in Honduras for infants aged 4 to 6 months with initial mean Hgb of at least 11 mg/dL. The researchers conclude that iron supplementation may pose risks in iron-replete infants."

Query 1: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 1: Reports of hypovitaminosis D among adults in the United States have drawn attention to the vitamin D status of children. National data on hypovitaminosis D among children are not yet available. Reports from 2000 and 2001 of rickets among children living in North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and the mid-Atlantic region, however, confirmed the presence of vitamin D deficiency among some US children and prompted new clinical guidelines to prevent its occurrence. We reviewed reports of nutritional rickets among US children <18 y of age that were published between 1986 and 2003. We identified 166 cases of rickets in 22 published studies. Patients were 4-54 mo of age, although in 17 studies the maximal age was <30 mo. Approximately 83% of children with rickets were described as African American or black, and 96% were breast-fed. Among children who were breast-fed, only 5% of records indicated vitamin D supplementation during breast-feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently recommended a minimal intake of 200 IU/d vitamin D for all infants, beginning in the first 2 mo of life. AAP recommends a vitamin D supplement for breast-fed infants who do not consume at least 500 mL of a vitamin D-fortified beverage. Given our finding of a disproportionate number of rickets cases among young, breast-fed, black children, we recommend that education regarding AAP guidelines emphasize the higher risk of rickets among these children. Education should also emphasize the importance of weaning children to a diet adequate in both vitamin D and calcium.
Summary 1: Among the 166 published cases of rickets in the US from 1986 to 2003, 83% were categorized as African American or black. Ninety-six percent of cases were breastfed.

Query 2: What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants?
Document 2: Widespread use of fluoride has been a major factor in the decline in the prevalence and severity of dental caries (i.e., tooth decay) in the United States and other economically developed countries. When used appropriately, fluoride is both safe and effective in preventing and controlling dental caries. All U.S. residents are likely exposed to some degree to fluoride, which is available from multiple sources. Both health-care professionals and the public have sought guidance on selecting the best way to provide and receive fluoride. During the late 1990s, CDC convened a work group to develop recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States. This report includes these recommendations, as well as a) critical analysis of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of fluoride modalities in preventing and controlling dental caries, b) ordinal grading of the quality of the evidence, and c) assessment of the strength of each recommendation. Because frequent exposure to small amounts of fluoride each day will best reduce the risk for dental caries in all age groups, the work group recommends that all persons drink water with an optimal fluoride concentration and brush their teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste. For persons at high risk for dental caries, additional fluoride measures might be needed. Measured use of fluoride modalities is particularly appropriate during the time of anterior tooth enamel development (i.e., age <6 years). The recommendations in this report guide dental and other health-care providers, public health officials, policy makers, and the public in the use of fluoride to achieve maximum protection against dental caries while using resources efficiently and reducing the likelihood of enamel fluorosis. The recommendations address public health and professional practice, self-care, consumer product industries and health agencies, and further research. Adoption of these recommendations could further reduce dental caries in the United States and save public and private resources.
Summary 2: No infant under 6 months of age should receive fluoride supplementation to prevent dental caries because of the risk of enamel fluorosis.

Document: This report represents a departure from the chapter on Oral Health that appeared in the 1996 edition of the Guide to Clinical and Preventive Services. That chapter focused on counseling for the prevention of dental diseases in all ages. This summary of evidence focuses exclusively on the evidence of effectiveness for procedures applied by physicians and other primary care clinicians to prevent carious lesions in young children.
Summary:","A systematic review that evaluated fluoride for preventing dental caries in primary teeth in children aged <5 years found 6 small clinical trials. Although the studies were not of high quality, they consistently showed that the incidence of caries was reduced by 32% to 72%."

Query 1: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 1: Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of exercise training as an treatment for FMS. We searched 6 electronic bibliographies for studies of exercise training in FMS: MEDLINE (1966-12/2000), CINAHL (1982-12/2000), HealthSTAR (1990-12/2000), Sports Discus (1975-05/2000), EMBASE (1974-05/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 4). We also reviewed the reference lists from identified articles including reviews and meta-analyses of treatment studies. Randomized trials focused on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength and/or flexibility as treatment for FMS were selected. Two reviewers independently identified trials meeting inclusion criteria, rated the methodologic quality using 2 standardized validated instruments, evaluated the adequacy of the exercise training stimulus using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria and evaluated the results. Disagreements were resolved through active discussion and consensus. High quality training studies had scores of 50% or greater on van Tulder methodologic criteria and met the minimum training standards of ACSM. Outcome variables were grouped into 7 constructs: pain, tender points, physical function, global well being, self efficacy, fatigue & sleep, and psychological function. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, results and point estimates for selected variables, and used consensus to address discrepancies. Sixteen trials involving a total of 724 participants were assigned at random to: exercise intervention groups (n=379), control groups (n=277), or groups receiving an alternate treatment (n=68). Seven studies were high quality training studies: 4 aerobic training, 1 a mixture of aerobic, strength and flexibility training, 1 strength training and 2 with exercise training as part of a composite treatment. Flexibility protocols were never described in sufficient detail to allow evaluation. The four high quality aerobic training studies reported significantly greater improvements in the exercise groups versus control groups in aerobic performance (17.1% increase in aerobic performance with exercise versus 0.5% increase in the control groups), tender point pain pressure threshold (28.1% increase versus 7.0% decrease) and improvements in pain (11.4% decrease in pain versus 1.6% increase). Poor description of exercise protocols was common, with insufficient information on intensity, duration, frequency and mode of exercise. Adverse events were also poorly reported. Supervised aerobic exercise training has beneficial effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms. Strength training may also have benefits on some FMS symptoms. Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed. Research on the long-term benefit of exercise for FMS is needed.
Summary 1: We examined the results of a systematic review of exercise for treating fibromyalgia. The authors found 7 high-quality studies, 4 of aerobic training, and concluded that supervised aerobic exercise training had beneficial effects on physical capacity, tender-point threshold, and pain. Other investigators have questioned the usefulness of aerobic exercise because long-term benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor.

Query 2: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 2: Non-malignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries. Fibromyalgia syndrome is an increasing recognised chronic musculoskeletal disorder. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. An electronic search was conducted and included Medline from 1966, PsycLIT from 1967 and EMBASE from 1980 to April 1998. The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register was searched as well as, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). The references of identified articles and reviews were checked, studies published in the Finnish medical database Medic from 1978 to 1998 screened and the Science Citation Index searched. Content experts were also contacted for additional or unpublished studies. From all references found in our original search, we selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients suffering from fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary; that is, it had to consist of a physician's consultation, plus a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of both. Four reviewers independently selected the RCTs and CCTs that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies to actual clinical use. Two other reviewers extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only seven relevant studies (1050 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. None of these were considered, methodologically, a high quality randomized controlled trial. Four of the included RCTs on fibromyalgia were graded low quality and suggest no quantifiable benefits. The three included RCTs on widespread musculoskeletal pain showed that based on limited evidence, overall, no evidence of efficacy was observed. However, behavioral treatment and stress management appear to be important components. Education combined with physical training showed some positive effects in long term follow up. We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these musculoskeletal disorders. However, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic musculoskeletal disorders, which cause much personal suffering and substantial economic loss to the society. There is a need for high quality trials in this field.
Summary 2: In a systematic review of 7 studies fulfilling inclusion criteria (a total of 1050 patients), Karjalainen and colleagues concluded that although education combined with physical training seemed to have some positive results at long-term follow-up, the level of scientific evidence required for recommending these programs for fibromyalgia was lacking.

Three of these trials included long-term follow-up of the exercise group participants. Patients who continued exercising maintained their improved physical functioning."

Query 1: Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 1: To assess separately the effectiveness and safety of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) and that of surgery in comparison to conservative management in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). DESIGN. A randomized study with 1-year follow-up. A university hospital acting as a referral center for OSAS. Symptomatic patients with OSAS (72 male and 4 female patients aged 18 to 65 years), who had oxygen desaturations in the overnight recording. After the initial diagnostic workup, patients were considered to be candidates for either N-CPAP (44 patients) or surgical treatment (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP] with or without mandibular osteotomy) (32 patients). Within the groups, the patients were then randomized to either the assigned treatment or conservative management. The number of nocturnal oxygen desaturation events of 4% or more per hour in bed (ODI4); daytime somnolence; side effects. N-CPAP Group: Compliance with N-CPAP therapy at 1 year was 13 of 21. The most common reason for noncompliance was general intolerance of CPAP. All compliant patients had a normal ODI4 ( < 10), whereas 1 of 20 of their control subjects had a normal finding. Patients receiving active treatment were significantly less somnolent than their control subjects at 1 year (p < 0.05). SURGERY GROUP: At 1 year, 7 of 18 of the surgically treated and 1 of 14 of the conservatively treated patients had a normal ODI4 (p < 0.001). Daytime somnolence was significantly less severe in the surgically treated patients compared with their control subjects (p < 0.001) both at 3 and 12 months. The overall postoperative complication rate was 22%. N-CPAP is an effective therapy for OSAS, but compliance is a problem. Surgical therapy (UPPP with or without mandibular osteotomy) needs further evaluation.
Summary 1: Lojander et al compared uvulopharyngopalatoplasty (UPPP) to conservative management (weight loss, smoking cessation, and alcohol avoidance advice) in 32 patients. Patients were excluded if they had asthma, obesity (body mass index >40), restless leg syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or intolerance of missed work because of somnolence. Remaining patients were selected as possible surgical candidates by a team of hospital-based experts then randomized to surgery or conservative therapy. At 1 year of follow-up, they found no change in nocturnal oxygen desaturation but some improvement in the mean score of a visual analog scale of daytime sleepiness and in the mean self-report of out-of-bed sleeping episodes. Unfortunately these subjective outcome measures have not been validated and are subject to bias. This, in addition to lack of intention-to-treat analysis, renders these results uninterpretable.

Query 2: Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 2: This paper, which has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Sleep Disorders Association, provides the background for the Standards of Practice Committee's parameters for the practice of sleep medicine in North America. The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, to provide the basis for the American Sleep Disorders Association's practice parameters on this subject and to share our findings of metanalysis of previously published studies regarding uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. We searched MEDLINE from January 1966 through April 1993, with an update in February 1995, to provide a review of the application of surgical modifications of the upper airway to treat adults with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Operations to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome include nasal septal reconstruction; uvulopalatopharyngoplasty; uvulopalatopharyngoglossoplasty; laser midline glossectomy; lingualplasty; inferior sagittal mandibular osteotomy and genioglossal advancement, with hyoid myotomy and suspension (the entire process is referred to as GAHM); maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement, and tracheotomy. Papers included in metanalysis provided preoperative and postoperative polysomnographic data on at least nine patients treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for their obstructive sleep apnea. Analysis of the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty papers revealed that this procedure is, at best, effective in treating less than 50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The site of pharyngeal narrowing or collapse, although identified by different and unvalidated methods, has a marked effect on the probability of success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Patients who achieve a favorable response with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty tend to have less severe obstructive sleep apnea than those who do not. For patients who demonstrate retrolingual narrowing or collapse, other surgical modifications have been described, such as lingualplasty, GAHM, and maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement. The studies to support the use of the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome contain biases related to small sample size, limited follow-up and patient selection.
Summary 2: the most optimistic review estimates that less than 50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea will benefit from surgery.

Query: Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea?
Document: Obstructive sleep apnoea is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of airflow during sleep. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Beside conservative treatments there are a range of 8 broad categories of operative treatments for this condition. Surgical treatments aim to relieve the obstruction by either increasing the surface area Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea aims to relieve the obstruction by increasing the surface area of the airway, bypassing the pharyngeal airways or removing a lesion. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnoea with other surgical or non-surgical interventions for obstructive sleep apnoea or no intervention. No completed trials were identified. No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials to be carried out in the field of surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea. More research should also be undertaken to identify and standardise techniques to determine the site of airways obstructions.
Summary:","Current recommendations in favor of surgical therapy are based solely on case series, poorly designed trials, expert opinion or pathophysiologic reasoning."

Query 1: What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease?
Document 1: To compare effectiveness of levodopa and levodopa combined with selegiline in treating early, mild Parkinson's disease. Open, long term, prospective randomised trial. 93 hospitals throughout United Kingdom. 520 patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving dopaminergic treatment. Treatment with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (arm 1) or levodopa and decarboxylase inhibitor in combination with selegiline (arm 2). Assessments of serial disability, frequency and severity of adverse events, and deaths from all causes. After average of 5-6 years' follow up, mortality ratio in arm 2 compared with arm 1 was 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.30), and difference in survival between the two arms was significant (log rank test, P = 0.015). Hazard ratio adjusted for age and sex was 1.49 (1.02 to 2.16), and after adjustment for other baseline factors it increased to 1.57 (1.07 to 2.31). Patients in arm 1 had slightly worse disability scores than those in arm 2, but differences were not significant. Functionally disabling peak dose dyskinesias and on/off fluctuations were more frequent in arm 2 than arm 1. During the trial the dose of levodopa required to produce optimum motor control steadily increased in arm 1 (median daily dose 375 mg at 1 year and 625 mg at 4 years), but median dose in arm 2 did not change (375 mg). Levodopa in combination with selegiline seemed to confer no clinical benefit over levodopa alone in treating early, mild Parkinson's disease. Moreover mortality was significantly higher with combination treatment, casting doubts on its chronic use in Parkinson's disease.
Summary 1: One large randomized controlled trial showed no difference in disability scores and an increase in mortality at 5.6 years when comparing selegiline combined with levodopa to levodopa alone. A re-analysis of this study has not supported this conclusion and found no increase in mortality in patients with a history of selegiline use.

Query 2: What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease?
Document 2: The value of an early initial coadministration of levodopa (L-dopa) and lisuride in Parkinson's disease was the main goal of the present study. Eighty-two patients with recently diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's disease were randomized into two groups for treatment with L-dopa alone or L-dopa + lisuride. The trial was double-blinded for the first year and open for the following 4 years. Selegiline (10 mg/day b.i.d.) was added in both groups at the end of the first year. Outcome measures were evolution of L-dopa dosage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores and subscores, and incidence of motor complications. The dropout rate was higher in the L-dopa group (63.4%) than in the combination group. Motor improvement was better (p < 0.01) in the L-dopa + lisuride group. Expected motor complications were rare, moderate and equivalent in the two groups despite a difference in L-dopa dosage (446.7 vs. 387.5 mg/day). Long-term follow-up demonstrated the L-dopa-sparing effect of lisuride (average 1 mg/day), the beneficial effect of early combination therapy on motor status and the paucity of motor complications in both groups.
Summary 2: A study comparing lisuride with or without levodopa vs levodopa alone found no difference in motor complications at 5 years.

Query: What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease?
Document: The long-term effectiveness of three different initial drug regimes in patients with early, mild PD was evaluated by the PD Research Group of the United Kingdom (PDRGUK). In 1995, the selegiline arm of the trial was terminated following an interim analysis. This was an open, randomized trial. Between 1985 and 1990, 782 patients with de-novo PD were recruited and randomized to one of three treatment arms: levodopa plus dopa decarboxylase inhibitor; levodopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor and selegiline; or bromocriptine. The main endpoints were mortality, disability, and adverse events. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. There was no significant difference in mortality between the bromocriptine and the levodopa arms (hazard ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.90, 1.47]). Patients initially randomized to bromocriptine had slightly worse disability scores throughout follow-up. This difference was significant during the first years. Patients in the bromocriptine arm returned to pretreatment disability levels one year earlier than those in the levodopa arm. Patients randomized to bromocriptine had a significantly lower incidence of dyskinesias than those randomized to levodopa (rate ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.57, 0.93]). However, this difference was not significant when only moderate to severe dyskinesias were considered. Patients in the bromocriptine arm had slightly lower rates of dystonias and on-off fluctuations, but moderate and severe forms were equally frequent in both arms. Starting treatment with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine does not reduce mortality in PD. A slightly lower incidence of motor complications is achieved at the expense of significantly worse disability scores throughout the first years of therapy.
Summary:","A large randomized controlled trial comparing bromocriptine with levodopa demonstrated that at 3 years, disability scores were lower in the patients initially assigned to bromocriptine, but the difference was no longer significant at 9 years. The bromocriptine group in this trial showed a lower incidence of dyskinesias when data from all patient groups were combined. However, when moderate to severe cases were analyzed separately, there was no significant difference."

Query 1: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document 1: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.
Summary 1: nicotine replacement therapy reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by partially replacing nicotine in the blood. Abstinence rates are superior to placebo based on a Cochrane review (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.66-1.88; NNT=20; 95% CI, 17-23).

Query 2: How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk?
Document 2: Although the importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is beyond doubt, the speed and magnitude of risk reduction when a smoker with coronary heart disease quits are still subjects of debate. To estimate the magnitude of risk reduction when a patient with CHD stops smoking. We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, PsychLit, Dissertation Abstracts, BIDS ISI Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings, UK National Research Register from the start of each database. Sixty-one large international cohort studies of cardiovascular disease were identified, and contact made with authors to search for any unpublished results. The search was supplemented by cross-checking references and contact with various experts. Date of last search was April 2003. Any prospective cohort studies of patients with a diagnosis of CHD, which include all-cause mortality as an outcome measure. Smoking status must be measured on at least two occasions to ascertain which smokers have quit, and followed-up for at least two years. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed independently by two reviewers. Twenty studies were included. There was a 36% reduction in crude relative risk (RR) of mortality for those who quit smoking compared with those who continued to smoke (RR 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.71). There was also a reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarctions (crude RR 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.82). Many studies did not adequately address quality issues, such as control of confounding, and misclassification of smoking status. However, there was little difference in the results for the six 'higher quality' studies, and little heterogeneity between these studies. This review was not able to assess how quickly the risk of mortality was reduced. Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with CHD. The pooled crude RR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). This 36% risk reduction appears substantial compared with other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering which have received greater attention in recent years. The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking seems consistent regardless of differences between the studies in terms of index cardiac events, age, sex, country, and time period. However, relatively few studies have included large numbers of older people, women, or people of non-European descent, and most were carried out in Western countries.
Summary 2: A Cochrane Heart Group meta-analysis examining all-cause coronary heart disease mortality in 20 cohort studies (n=12,603 patients), found a 36% reduction in mortality risk for coronary heart disease patients who quit smoking compared with those who did not (RR=0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.71). The review also noted a reduction in risk for nonfatal myocardial infarctions (RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.82).

Document: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in July 2002. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model (Peto). We identified 110 trials; 96 with a non NRT control group. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.64 - 1.86), The odds ratios for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 for gum, 1.74 for patches, 2.27 for nasal spray, 2.08 for inhaled nicotine and 2.08 for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2mg gum (odds ratio 2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.69 - 4.22). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy, in which bupropion was significantly more effective than nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine gum, transdermal patch, the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in combination). However, its most appropriate place in the therapeutic armamentarium requires further study and consideration.
Summary:","A Cochrane Review of 110 trials evaluating the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy in 35,600 smokers found higher quit rates among heavy smokers using 4-mg compared with 2-mg nicotine gum (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-4.22)."

Query 1: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document 1: To study awareness of urinary tract infections (UTIs) by determining the diagnostic rate of first UTI in children <2 years of age and to estimate the minimum incidence. Twenty-six of a total of 43 pediatric centers participated in the study. Sixty-four percent of the total childhood population <2 years of age was covered. The number of all children included in the study was used to calculate the diagnostic rate. Only UTI confirmed by either suprapubic aspiration (any growth) or midstream or bag samples with >/=100 000 bacteria/mL, together with a positive nitrite reaction, was used to estimate the minimum incidence. The mean diagnostic rate was 1.5% for boys (range, 0.7%-3.0%) and 1.7% for girls (range, 0.7%-2.9%). The diagnostic rate was significantly higher in June than in December. The mean incidence was 1.0% for both boys and girls (range, 0.3%-3.0% and 0.4%-2.9%, respectively). The minimum cumulative incidence at 2 years of age was estimated to be 2.2% for boys and 2.1% for girls. This study suggests a high UTI awareness in Sweden as indicated by a higher diagnostic rate and, despite stricter diagnostic criteria, a higher incidence of UTI in children <2 years of age than previously reported. It is suggested that a high UTI awareness may reduce chronic renal failure because of pyelonephritic renal scarring.
Summary 1: The prevalence of urinary tract infection in childhood has been estimated to be roughly 1%.

Query 2: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document 2: Screening children for asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis and renal scarring is widely recommended, but its cost-effectiveness has not been established. We reviewed published studies to determine the costs and benefits of screening toilet-trained, asymptomatic children for bacteriuria. Given the sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods (approximately 80% each) and the prevalence of bacteriuria in asymptomatic children (approximately 1% in girls and 0.03% in boys), screening 100,000 children would result in 19,897 (20%) false-positive tests; initial screening and two urine cultures to confirm the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria would miss 28% of 515 children with true bacteriuria, and cost nearly $2.9 million. There is no evidence that detection and treatment of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria prevents subsequent pyelonephritis or renal scarring. Screening for bacteriuria in asymptomatic children is costly, fails to prevent pyelonephritis or renal scarring, and should be discontinued as a part of routine well-child care.
Summary 2: Expert opinion varies as to the necessity of screening urinalysis. No prospective randomized trials demonstrate improved outcomes, and limited evidence suggests that detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria improves long-term outcomes such as renal scarring, hypertension, or pyelone phritis.

Query: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document: Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and are obtained noninvasively, the urine testing is well suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes and also less common tests for diagnosis of specific disorders. Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are discussed. Some simple tests that are underused by clinicians are mentioned, as are some exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.
Summary:",Currently vailable screening urinalyses using chemical dipstick testing have reported sensitivities ranging from 53% to 93% and specificities of 72% to 98% for detecting significant bacteriuria.

Query 1: Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients?
Document 1: Some epidemiological studies have suggested that high dietary intake of calcium and fibre reduces colorectal carcinogenesis. Available data are not sufficient to serve as a basis for firm dietary advice. We undertook a multicentre randomised trial to test the effect of diet supplementation with calcium and fibre on adenoma recurrence. We randomly assigned 665 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas to three treatment groups, in a parallel design: calcium gluconolactate and carbonate (2 g elemental calcium daily), fibre (3.5 g ispaghula husk), or placebo. Participants had colonoscopy after 3 years of follow-up. The primary endpoint was adenoma recurrence. Analyses were by intention to treat. 23 patients died, 15 were lost to follow-up, 45 refused repeat colonoscopy, and five developed severe contraindications to colonoscopy. Among the 552 participants who completed the follow-up examination, 94 stopped treatment early. At least one adenoma developed in 28 (15.9%) of 176 patients in the calcium group, 58 (29.3%) of 198 in the fibre group, and 36 (20.2%) of 178 in the placebo group. The adjusted odds ratio for recurrence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.38-1.17; p=0.16) for calcium treatment and 1.67 (1.01-2.76, p=0.042) for the fibre treatment. The odds ratio associated with the fibre treatment was significantly higher in participants with baseline dietary calcium intake above the median than in those with intake below the median (interaction test, p=0.028) Supplementation with fibre as ispaghula husk may have adverse effects on colorectal adenoma recurrence, especially in patients with high dietary calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with a modest but not significant reduction in the risk of adenoma recurrence.
Summary 1: In a trial of ispaghula husk fiber, the intervention group actually had significantly more recurrent adenomas after 3 years 29.3% vs 20.2%; RR=1.67; 95% CI, 1.01-2.76; P=.04.

Query 2: What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome?
Document 2: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre in irritable bowel syndrome management. To quantify the effect of different types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome. Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using soluble and insoluble fibre separately. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium, ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). The benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases, insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary care.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 17 RCTs (9 of soluble fiber, 8 of insoluble) (N=1363) found soluble fiber more effective than placebo (pooled RR=1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78) for reduction in global symptoms and constipation. Insoluble fiber was no better than placebo (pooled RR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). Abdominal pain was not reduced with either fiber.

Query: Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients?
Document: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Experimental evidence has supported the hypothesis that dietary fibre may be protective for the development of CRC, although epidemiologic data have been inconclusive. We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of dietary fibre on the incidence or recurrence of colorectal adenomas, the incidence of CRC, and the development of adverse events. We identified randomized controlled trials from Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to Oct 2001 Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were assessed. The population included all subjects that had adenomatous polyps but no previous history of colorectal cancer (CRC), a documented ""clean colon"" at baseline and repeated visualization of the colon/rectum after at least two years of follow-up. Dietary fibre was the intervention. The primary outcomes were the number of subjects with: a) at least one adenoma, b) more than one adenoma, c) at least one adenoma greater than or equal to 1 cm or d) a new diagnosis of CRC. The secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. The outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If statistical significance was reached, the number need to treat (NNTT) or harm (NNTH) was reported. The study data were combined with the fixed effects model if it was clinically, methodologically, and statistically reasonable. Five studies with 4349 subjects met the inclusion criteria. The interventions were wheat bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high fibre whole food sources alone or in combination. When the data were combined there was no difference between the intervention and control groups for the number of subjects with at least one adenoma [RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.95,1.13); RD 0.01 (95% CI 0.02,0.04)]. As well, the combined results for the number of subjects with more than one adenoma [RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.89,1.17), RD 0.00 (-0.02,0.03)] or at least one adenoma 1 cm or greater [RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.77,1.15), RD -0.01 (-0.02,0.01)] were not statistically significant. Other primary and secondary outcomes and subanalyses by type of fibre intervention were not statistically or clinically significant. There is currently no evidence from RCTs to suggest that increased dietary fibre intake will reduce the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps within a two to four year period.
Summary:","A Cochrane meta-analysis of 5 trials including 4349 subjects of increased dietary fiber to prevent recurrence of colon adenomas found no difference between intervention and control groups for development of at least 1 adenoma relative risk [RR]=1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.13."

Query 1: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document 1: To review recent evidence on dietary factors associated with diverticular disease (DD) with special emphasis on dietary fibre. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles on the relationship between dietary and other lifestyle factors and DD. Most articles either focused on dietary intervention in treating symptomatic DD or were case-control studies with inherent limitations for studying diet-disease associations. Only one large prospective study of male health professionals in the United States assessed diet at baseline and before initial diagnosis of DD. A diet high in fibre mainly from fruits and vegetables and low in total fat and red meat decreases risk of DD. Evidence indicates that the insoluble component of fibre is strongly associated with lower risk of DD; this association was particularly strong for cellulose. Caffeine and alcohol do not substantially increase risk of DD, nor does obesity, but higher levels of physical activity seem to reduce risk of DD. A diet high in fibre and low in total fat and red meat and a lifestyle with more physical activity might help prevent DD.
Summary 1: Because of strong epidemiological evidence that people from cultures with high-fiber diets are far less likely to develop diverticulosis than are people who live in cultures of low-fiber diets, it has been assumed that a diet high in fiber can prevent diverticulosis. Many small, uncontrolled studies have also investigated the effect of high-fiber diets and supplements on symptoms of diverticulosis and prevention of diverticulitis episodes.

Query 2: How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer?
Document 2: To perform a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MEDLINE and the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, January 1993 through September 2001. Original economic evaluations of colorectal cancer screening in average-risk patients were reviewed. The authors sought studies addressing the incremental cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies compared with no screening, of different screening strategies compared with one another, and of different ages of screening initiation and cessation. Two investigators independently reviewed each abstract, and potentially eligible articles were retrieved. A four-member working group reached consensus regarding final inclusion or exclusion of articles. One reviewer extracted data into evidence tables. The results were checked by other members and discrepancies resolved by consensus. Among 180 potential articles identified, 7 were retained in the final analysis. Compared with no screening, cost-effectiveness ratios for screening with any of the commonly considered methods were generally between 10, 000 dollars and 25, 000 dollars per life-year saved. No one strategy was consistently found to be the most effective or to have the best incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Currently available models provided insufficient evidence to determine optimal starting and stopping ages for screening. Screening for colorectal cancer appears cost-effective compared with no screening, but a single optimal strategy cannot be determined from the currently available data. Additional data regarding adherence with screening over time, complication rates in real-world settings, and colorectal cancer biology are needed. Additional analyses are necessary to determine optimal ages of initiation and cessation.
Summary 2: A subsequent 2005 Veterans Affairs prospective cohort study found that the sensitivity for detecting advanced neoplasia was only 4.9% for digital FOBT, and negative results did not decrease the likelihood of advanced neoplasia.

Query: Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients?
Document: Dietary fiber has been implicated in colorectal neoplasia, despite conflicting evidence. This is a review of the currently available data on the role of dietary fiber in colorectal carcinogenesis. A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database. All case-control, longitudinal, and randomized, controlled studies published in English between 1988 and 2000 were identified, as were animal model studies in the period 1986 to 2000. Data from the various studies were tabulated and systematically analyzed, with particular emphasis on the effect of dietary fiber on tumor incidence and luminal parameters such as short chain fatty acids. Epidemiologic correlation studies show a high intake of dietary fiber to be associated with a lower risk of colorectal neoplasia. Thirteen of the 24 case-control studies reviewed demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal neoplasia, and 16 showed a protective effect of vegetables or vegetable fiber. On the other hand, of 13 longitudinal studies in various cohorts, only 3 demonstrated a protective effect of fiber and 4 a protective effect of vegetables or vegetable fiber. The five published randomized, controlled trials all investigated the effect of increased fiber intake on short-term adenoma recurrence; however, none showed any significant protective effect. Among 19 experimental studies in animal models, 15 showed a protective effect of fiber against tumor induction compared with controls. Animal studies also showed that poorly fermentable fibers (e.g., wheat bran and cellulose) were more protective than soluble fibers (e.g., guar gum and oat bran), which sometimes enhanced carcinogenesis. No clear correlation was found between luminal pH or short chain fatty acids and tumor induction. On the basis of current data, there is little evidence to support the use of dietary fiber supplements to reduce the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Lifelong and early exposure may be important but are difficult to study. Other risk factors interact with the effects of dietary fiber.
Summary:","A systematic review of dietary fiber and colorectal neoplasia (which included case-control and cohort studies as well as randomized controlled trials) showed that 13 of 24 case-control studies found an association with high dietary fiber as a possible protective factor, while only 3 of 13 longitudinal studies found such an association."

Query 1: Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?
Document 1: Despite the increasing recognition of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, there are few controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, particularly with nonstimulants. One controlled trial found bupropion SR more effective than placebo in the treatment of ADHD adults. We conducted a controlled study to contrast the effectiveness of bupropion SR and methylphenidate to placebo in ADHD adults. A randomized, double-blind, parallel design was used in this study. Following a 7-day placebo lead-in, 30 ADHD (DSM-IV) subjects (18-60 years old) were randomized to bupropion, methylphenidate, or placebo for 7 weeks. Methylphenidate was titrated over 1 week to a maximum dose of 0.9 mg/kg/d divided into 3 doses while bupropion was titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg A.M. and 100 mg P.M. Response rates based on Clinical Global Impression improvement ratings in patients receiving bupropion, methylphenidate, and placebo were 64, 50, and 27%, respectively. The difference in response rates between active treatment and placebo was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). Neuropsychological testing demonstrated trends favoring drug treatment on measures of immediate recall and verbal fluency. While bupropion SR may be a viable clinical alternative for adults with ADHD, further investigation is needed.
Summary 1: A 7-week randomized controlled trial compared methylphenidate with sustained-release buproprion. Thirty out of 37 subjects completed at least 1 week of the study. The primary indicator of a favorable response was the Clinical Global Impression Scale. The rate of response was 50% for methylphenidate, 64% for sustained-release buproprion, and 27% for placebo (P<.14).

Query 2: Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?
Document 2: To determine (a) the long-term and short-term effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and (b) whether combined interventions are more effective than individual interventions. MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), HEALTHStar (from 1975), PsycINFO (from 1984), EMBASE (from 1984), and the Cochrane Library searches were completed in November 1997. Reference lists of eligible studies and files of members of the research team and partner organizations were also searched. Studies were selected if they focused on the treatment of ADHD in humans and were published in any language as a full report in peer-reviewed journals. Studies including conditions other than ADHD were reported if separate subgroup analyses for patients with ADHD were provided. Two reviewers independently extracted data for 41 variables on general characteristics, along with detailed information on interventions, outcomes, and tests. Differences were resolved by consensus or by a third researcher. Studies were not combined quantitatively because the quality of reporting was low and heterogeneity existed across outcome measures and tests. Seventy-eight studies (77 randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies compared drugs and showed few, if any, differences among methylphenidate (MPH), dextroamphetamine (DEX), and pemoline; studies comparing stimulants with tricyclic antidepressants (2) were inconclusive. Six studies compared drugs with nondrug interventions and showed consistently that stimulants, particularly MPH, may be more effective than nonpharmacological interventions. Twenty studies compared combination therapies with a stimulant or a nondrug intervention alone; no additional beneficial effects for combination therapies were shown. Nine studies compared tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and showed that desipramine may be more effective than placebo; no consistent effect was shown for imipramine. Fourteen studies (13 in school children and 1 in adults) evaluated long-term therapy (> or = 12 weeks) and showed a trend to general improvement regardless of treatment, but the length of followup was inadequate. MPH may reduce behavioral disturbance in children with ADHD while it is taken. Academic performance does not appear to be improved with stimulants. Twelve studies evaluated treatment in adults with ADHD. For MPH vs. placebo, the results were contradictory. Antidepressants may be effective in adults, but no beneficial effect was seen with pemoline, nicotine, or phenylalanine compared with placebo. Thirty-two reports (29 studies) evaluated adverse effects of drug therapy; many of the side effects associated with stimulant use appear to be relatively mild and of short duration and to respond to dosing or timing adjustments. Data are inadequate on the long-term effects and severity of adverse effects of most interventions. This report describes rigorous systematic reviews on the treatment of ADHD, ready for incorporation into evidence-based clinical practice guidelines or performance measures. The report also provides a detailed description of the many limitations of the evidence available and provides recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Studies on ADHD have low reporting quality, methodological flaws, and heterogeneity across outcome measures and tests. A detailed description is included of the many limitations of the available evidence plus recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Fulfilling such knowledge gaps will not be easy and will require genuine collaboration among decisionmakers.
Summary 2: A well-done systematic review of 12 trials assessing the efficacy of stimulant therapy in the treatment of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder did not find sufficient evidence that stimulants were effective. Significant heterogeneity and poor reporting of methodology was seen among the studies.

Query: Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD?
Document: Despite the increasing recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, the use of pharmacotherapeutics remains less established. A systematic review of the literature identified 15 studies (N = 435 subjects) of stimulants, and 22 studies of non-stimulant medications (N = 421 subjects) including antidepressants, antihypertensives, amino acids, and wake-promoting agents for the treatment of ADHD in adults. Studies with stimulants and antidepressants demonstrated significant short-term improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo in adults. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine had an immediate onset of action whereas the ADHD response to pemoline and antidepressants appeared delayed. The response to amphetamine and MPH appears to be dose-dependent. Controlled data on nicotonic and noradrenergic compounds appear promising. There was considerable variability in diagnostic criteria, dosing parameters, and response rates between the various studies. Under controlled conditions, the aggregate literature shows that the stimulants and noradrenergic antidepressants had a clinically and statistically significant beneficial effect on treating ADHD in adults.
Summary:","A less rigorous systematic review identified 15 studies of stimulant efficacy in adults. Researchers concluded that under controlled conditions, stimulants are efficacious in the treatment of ADHD in adults. The rate of response among the studies ranged from 25% to 78%."

Query 2: What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children?
Document 2: Studies examining interventions for adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reviewed to evaluate their efficacy. These efficacy findings were supplemented with a preliminary system for judging safety and practicality. Results suggest that the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) is safe and well-established empirically, but has some problems with inconvenience and noncompliance. Preliminary research supports the efficacy, safety, and practicality of some psychotherapeutic interventions, including behavioral classroom interventions, note-taking training, and family therapy. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was judged to have minimal empirical support and debatable safety. Very little is known about long-term effectiveness of treatments, long-term compliance, or multimodal treatments for adolescents such as stimulants plus behavior therapy.
Summary 2: Several short-term reviews and meta-analyses show that side effects from stimulant medications are mild and have short duration. More long-term studies are required to evaluate effects on growth.

Query: Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD?
Document: There are few controlled studies of methylphenidate hydrochloride in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their results have been equivocal. The discrepancies among these studies may be related to low doses, diagnostic uncertainties, and lack of attention to comorbid disorders. We conducted a randomized, 7-week, placebo-controlled, crossover study of methylphenidate in 23 adult patients with DSM-III-R ADHD using standardized instruments for diagnosis, separate assessments of ADHD and depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a robust daily dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride, 1.0 mg/kg per day. We found a marked therapeutic response for methylphenidate treatment of ADHD symptoms that exceeded the placebo response (78% vs 4%, P < .0001). Response to methylphenidate was independent of gender, psychiatric comorbidity with anxiety or moderate depression, or family history of psychiatric disorders. Robust doses of methylphenidate are effective in the treatment of adult ADHD.
Summary:","A high-quality study was a 7-week randomized controlled trial using a crossover comparison of methylphenidate and placebo. There was a favorable response in 78% (18/23) of subjects while takin methylphenidate, in contrast to 4% (1/23) while taking placebo (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.4; P<.0001). A favorable response was assessed by the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a measure of illness severity and improvement, and a >30% reduction in symptoms as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale."

Response rates based on Clinical Global Impression improvement ratings in patients receiving bupropion, methylphenidate, and placebo were 64, 50, and 27%, respectively. The difference in response rates between active treatment and placebo was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). Neuropsychological testing demonstrated trends favoring drug treatment on measures of immediate recall and verbal fluency. While bupropion SR may be a viable clinical alternative for adults with ADHD, further investigation is needed.
Summary 1: A 7-week randomized controlled trial compared methylphenidate with sustained-release buproprion. Thirty out of 37 subjects completed at least 1 week of the study. The primary indicator of a favorable response was the Clinical Global Impression Scale. The rate of response was 50% for methylphenidate, 64% for sustained-release buproprion, and 27% for placebo (P<.14).

Query 2: Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?
Document 2: To determine (a) the long-term and short-term effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and (b) whether combined interventions are more effective than individual interventions. MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), HEALTHStar (from 1975), PsycINFO (from 1984), EMBASE (from 1984), and the Cochrane Library searches were completed in November 1997. Reference lists of eligible studies and files of members of the research team and partner organizations were also searched. Studies were selected if they focused on the treatment of ADHD in humans and were published in any language as a full report in peer-reviewed journals. Studies including conditions other than ADHD were reported if separate subgroup analyses for patients with ADHD were provided. Two reviewers independently extracted data for 41 variables on general characteristics, along with detailed information on interventions, outcomes, and tests. Differences were resolved by consensus or by a third researcher. Studies were not combined quantitatively because the quality of reporting was low and heterogeneity existed across outcome measures and tests. Seventy-eight studies (77 randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies compared drugs and showed few, if any, differences among methylphenidate (MPH), dextroamphetamine (DEX), and pemoline; studies comparing stimulants with tricyclic antidepressants (2) were inconclusive. Six studies compared drugs with nondrug interventions and showed consistently that stimulants, particularly MPH, may be more effective than nonpharmacological interventions. Twenty studies compared combination therapies with a stimulant or a nondrug intervention alone; no additional beneficial effects for combination therapies were shown. Nine studies compared tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and showed that desipramine may be more effective than placebo; no consistent effect was shown for imipramine. Fourteen studies (13 in school children and 1 in adults) evaluated long-term therapy (> or = 12 weeks) and showed a trend to general improvement regardless of treatment, but the length of followup was inadequate. MPH may reduce behavioral disturbance in children with ADHD while it is taken. Academic performance does not appear to be improved with stimulants. Twelve studies evaluated treatment in adults with ADHD. For MPH vs. placebo, the results were contradictory. Antidepressants may be effective in adults, but no beneficial effect was seen with pemoline, nicotine, or phenylalanine compared with placebo. Thirty-two reports (29 studies) evaluated adverse effects of drug therapy; many of the side effects associated with stimulant use appear to be relatively mild and of short duration and to respond to dosing or timing adjustments. Data are inadequate on the long-term effects and severity of adverse effects of most interventions. This report describes rigorous systematic reviews on the treatment of ADHD, ready for incorporation into evidence-based clinical practice guidelines or performance measures. The report also provides a detailed description of the many limitations of the evidence available and provides recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Studies on ADHD have low reporting quality, methodological flaws, and heterogeneity across outcome measures and tests. A detailed description is included of the many limitations of the available evidence plus recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Fulfilling such knowledge gaps will not be easy and will require genuine collaboration among decisionmakers.
Summary 2: A well-done systematic review of 12 trials assessing the efficacy of stimulant therapy in the treatment of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder did not find sufficient evidence that stimulants were effective. Significant heterogeneity and poor reporting of methodology was seen among the studies.

Query: Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD?
Document: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the alpha-2a agonist guanfacine with that of dextroamphetamine for the treatment of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Seventeen adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study comparing drug effects on ADHD symptoms. Measures of change included the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults and the Copeland Symptom Checklist for Adult Attention Deficit Disorders. Cognitive measures of attention included the Stroop and Controlled Oral Word Association Test using the letters ""C,"" ""F,"" and ""L"" (COWAT, CFL version). For each trial, the drug was administered daily and titered up to optimal doses of maximum efficacy but with a minimum of side effects, and then data were collected. Both drugs significantly reduced ADHD symptoms on the DSM-IV Adult Behavior Checklist for Adults over placebo (p < 0.05). The Stroop Color subscale showed significant improvement for both drugs (p < 0.05), but the Color-Word measures showed significant improvement for guanfacine only (p < 0.01). The average dose of guanfacine was 1.10 (SD = 0.60), and the most common side effect of guanfacine was fatigue. No subjects discontinued drug trials. This preliminary study indicates that guanfacine may be a well-tolerated treatment option for adult ADHD.
Summary:","A study compared dextroamphetamine, guanfacine (an antihypertensive agent), and placebo in 17 patients. On the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults, subjects taking dextroamphetamine or guanfacine reported similar decreases in mean ADHD scores compared with placebo (24 vs 22 vs 30; P<.05). They did not report the number of subjects who had a 30% reduction in symptoms. Of note: at the end of the study but prior to unblinding, subjects were asked which medication they preferred. Twelve subjects chose dextroamphetamine, 4 chose guanfacine, and 1 chose placebo. Subjects' stated reason for choosing dextroamphetamine was the positive effect it had on their motivation."

Query 2: Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?
Document 2: Despite the increasing recognition of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, there are few controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, particularly with nonstimulants. One controlled trial found bupropion SR more effective than placebo in the treatment of ADHD adults. We conducted a controlled study to contrast the effectiveness of bupropion SR and methylphenidate to placebo in ADHD adults. A randomized, double-blind, parallel design was used in this study. Following a 7-day placebo lead-in, 30 ADHD (DSM-IV) subjects (18-60 years old) were randomized to bupropion, methylphenidate, or placebo for 7 weeks. Methylphenidate was titrated over 1 week to a maximum dose of 0.9 mg/kg/d divided into 3 doses while bupropion was titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg A.M. and 100 mg P.M.

Query: Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD?
Document: We report on a controlled trial of a mixed amphetamine salts compound (Adderall, dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextro-, levoamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine aspartate, levoamphetamine aspartate, and dextroamphetamine saccharate) in the treatment of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This was a 7-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of Adderall in 27 well-characterized adults satisfying full DSM-IV criteria for ADHD of childhood onset and persistent symptoms into adulthood. Medication was titrated up to 30 mg twice a day. Outcome measures included the ADHD Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Score. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were assessed to test for potential effects on treatment outcome. Treatment with Adderall at an average oral dose of 54 mg (administered in 2 daily doses) was effective and well tolerated. Drug-specific improvement in ADHD symptoms was highly significant overall (42% decrease on the ADHD Rating Scale, P<.001), and sufficiently robust to be detectable in a parallel groups comparison restricted to the first 3 weeks of the protocol (P<.001). The percentage of subjects who improved (reduction in the ADHD rating scale of > or =30%) was significantly higher with Adderall treatment than with a placebo (70% vs 7%; P =.001). Adderall was effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of adults with ADHD. More work is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of Adderall, or other amphetamine compounds, in the treatment of adults with ADHD.
Summary:","A study was a randomized controlled trial of mixed amphetamine salts. Of the 27 adults who completed the study, 19 (70%) responded favorably to mixed amphetamine salts compared with 2 (7.4%) receiving placebo (NNT=1.6; P<.001). Favorable response was defined as more than a 30% reduction of symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale."

Query 1: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document 1: Evaluate whether weight-loss diets are more effective than regular diets or other antihypertensive therapies in controlling blood pressure and preventing morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults. MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched through November 1997. Trials known to experts in the field were included through June 1998. For inclusion in the review, trials were required to meet each of the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials with one group assigned to a weight-loss diet and the other group assigned to either normal diet or antihypertensive therapy; 2) ambulatory adults with a mean blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic; 3) active intervention consisting of a calorie-restricted diet intended to produce weight loss (excluded studies simultaneously implementing multiple lifestyle interventions where the effects of weight loss could not be disaggregated); and 4) outcome measures included weight loss and blood pressure. Studies were dual abstracted by two independent reviewers using a standardized form designed specifically for this review. The primary mode of analysis was qualitative; graphs of effect sizes for individual studies were also used. Eighteen trials were found. Only one small study of inadequate power reported morbidity and mortality outcomes. None addressed quality of life or general well being issues. In general, participants assigned to weight-reduction groups lost weight compared to control groups. Six trials involving 361 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus a normal diet. The data suggested weight loss in the range of 4% to 8% of body weight was associated with a decrease in blood pressure in the range of 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Three trials involving 363 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus treatment with antihypertensive medications. These suggested that a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications produced greater decreases in blood pressure (in the range of 6/5 mm Hg systolic/diastolic) than did a weight-loss diet. Trials that allowed adjustment of participants' antihypertensive regimens suggested that patients required less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy if they followed a weight-reducing diet. Data was insufficient to determine the relative efficacy of weight-reduction versus changes in sodium or potassium intake or exercise. Weight-reducing diets in overweight hypertensive persons can affect modest weight loss in the range of 3-9% of body weight and are probably associated with modest blood pressure decreases of roughly 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Weight-reducing diets may decrease dosage requirements of persons taking antihypertensive medications.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review of 18 trials with 2611 participants concluded that for overweight hypertensive patients, weight loss of 3% to 9% of body weight is associated with 3 mm Hg decreases in both systolic blood pressure and DBP.

Query 2: Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults?
Document 2: In the past, interventions aimed at reducing obesity have mainly targeted at weight loss treatment in obese adults, with limited long-term effects. With the increasing number of people being obese and being at risk for obesity, there has been a shift in focus towards prevention of obesity. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on the efficacy of obesity prevention interventions in adults in order to identify effective interventions and intervention elements. Pubmed, OVID, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 1996 to June 2006. Interventions aimed at primary prevention of weight gain among adults achieved by focusing on dietary intake, physical activity or the combination of both were included. The outcome measure had to be difference in change in body mass index or body weight between the intervention and the control groups. Nine studies were included, five long-term studies (at least 1 year) and four short-term (3 months to 1 year). Seven studies evaluated an intervention that focused on a combination of diet and physical activity to prevent weight gain, one on diet only and one on physical activity only. One dietary intervention (long-term), and three combined dietary and physical activity interventions (one long-term and two short-term) produced significantly positive results at end of follow-up. The two long-term, effective interventions consisted of intensive and long-term intervention implementation, including groups sessions designed to promote behavioural changes. The current evidence of efficacy of obesity prevention interventions is based on a very small number of studies. Some studies showed a positive impact on body mass index or weight status, but there was too much heterogeneity in terms of study design, theoretical underpinning and target population to draw firm conclusions about which intervention approaches are more effective than others. More research is urgently needed to extend the body of evidence.
Summary 2: A systematic review of obesity prevention studies found 9 RCTs demonstrating that dietary and physical activity interventions can prevent weight gain, but lacking sufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of program.

Query: Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower LDL cholesterol?
Document: This paper aims to review the evidence for long-term effectiveness of weight loss on cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides in overweight/obese people. Current evidence is mostly based on short-term studies. A systematic review of long-term lipid outcomes of weight loss in studies published between 1966 and 2001, was conducted. Inclusion criteria included all cohort studies and trials carried out on participants with body mass index of greater than or equal to 28 kg m(-2). Studies had at least two weight change measurements and follow-up of more than 2 years. Thirteen long-term studies with a follow-up of more than 2 years were included. Cholesterol has a significant positive linear relationship with weight change (r = 0.89) where change in weight explains about 80% of the cholesterol difference variation (Adj R2 = 0.80). For every 10 kg weight loss a drop of 0.23 mmol L(-1) in cholesterol may be expected for a person suffering from obesity or are grossly overweight. Weight loss has long-term beneficial effects especially on LDL and cholesterol. Weight loss in obese patients should be encouraged and sustained.
Summary:","A meta-analysis found a 0.8 mg/dL LDL-C decrease for every kg of weight lost. Long-term follow-up, however, showed that LDL-C returned to baseline even when weight loss was maintained. Eight clinical trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in LDL-C postintervention with up to 10 kg of weight loss. Studies using weight-loss drugs (Sibutramine, Orlistat) found more significant weight loss during treatment, along with greater decrease in LDL-C, when compared with studies using only lifestyle modifications."

Query 1: What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome?
Document 1: To present efficacy and cycle control data pooled from three pivotal studies of the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra/Evra). Three multicenter, open-label, contraceptive studies that included up to 13 treatment cycles.Setting: 183 centers. 3,319 women.Intervention(s): Three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) with 1 patch-free week per cycle. Contraceptive efficacy and cycle control. Overall and method failure life-table estimates of contraceptive failure through 13 cycles were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%) and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%), respectively. Corresponding Pearl indices were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33) and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.31-1.10). Contraceptive failure among women with a body weight < 90 kg (<198 lb) was low and uniformly distributed across the weight range. A subgroup of women with body weight > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb) may have increased risk of pregnancy. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was low and decreased over time. In contraceptive patch users, the overall annual probability of pregnancy was 0.8% and the method failure probability was 0.6%. The efficacy of the patch was high and similar across age and racial groups. Among women < 90 kg (<198 lb), contraceptive failure was low and uniformly distributed across the range of body weights. In women > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb), contraceptive failures may be increased. Efficacy and cycle control have been shown to be comparable to an established oral contraceptive.
Summary 1: When it comes to the combination contraceptive patch, the data show a significant association between baseline body weight and pregnancy. In an analysis of pooled data, 5 of 15 pregnancies occurred in a subgroup of women with a baseline body weight ≥90 kg. Less than 3% of the study population weighed more than 90 kg. Specific data for this subgroup were not presented in the study results, so measures of effect cannot be calculated. The mechanism of the decreased efficacy of the combined contraceptive patch for obese women is unclear.

Query 2: What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome?
Document 2: A combined contraceptive vaginal ring designed to last 12 months was tested at three clinic sites. This ring released approximately 1 mg of norethindrone acetate (NET-Ac) and 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol (EE) daily. A total of 60 women were enrolled to use the ring in a schedule of 3 weeks in/1 week out. Serum norethindrone (NET) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were assayed twice weekly in cycles 6, 9, and 13. Mean NET concentrations between cycles 6 and 9 were relatively stable between 13 and 19 nmol/L but showed a 10%-21% decrease in all centers between cycles 9 and 13. Mean EE concentrations ranged from 75 to 103 pmol/L, but did not have the same decrease as NET between cycles 9 and 13. Cycles with progesterone peaks (> 9.6 nmol/L) compatible with some luteal activity occurred in 4% of cycles sampled in Sydney, 3% in Santo Domingo, and 26% in Los Angeles. Half of these cycles exhibited at least one progesterone value > 32 nmol/L with three of 18 occurring in noncompliant cycles. Heavier body weight was associated with increased probability of luteal activity. Based on serum estradiol peaks > 400 pmol/L, eight of 81 cycles appeared to have marked follicular activity with no luteal activity. No pregnancies occurred. Nausea was reported by about half the subjects in approximately 10% of the visits (mainly in the first 1-2 days in the first cycle immediately after ring insertion). Vomiting was reported by 20% of subjects early in the first cycle only. Headache was reported on occasion by nearly 50% of the women, but the relationship to ring use was uncertain. Vaginal discharge was reported by 17 women (82% of these were from one clinic). Of 60 women, 14 discontinued before completing the study, but only two discontinuations were for medical reasons. Small but statistically significant changes occurred in lipid levels in two of the three centers. All changes remained within normal limits and were similar to those seen with many oral contraceptives. It appears that this ring may perform slightly differently in different populations, but is a highly satisfactory method of contraception for many women. Minor modifications in design could provide higher levels of steroid release and in the later months of the ring life span would assure continuing high levels of contraceptive protection for heavier women. This study determines the ovarian effects, contraceptive efficacy, and effects  on serum levels of norethindrone acetate (NET-Ac) and ethinyl estradiol (EE)  among women using a single contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) cyclically over a  period of 1 year.  A total of 60 women were enrolled and used the ring according  to a schedule of 3 weeks ""in"" and 1 week ""out.""  Assays of serum norethindrone  acetate (NET-Ac) ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were taken twice weekly in cycles  6, 9, and 13.  Despite luteal activity in some cycles, no pregnancies were noted  within the 12-month study period.  Heavier body weight was associated with  increased probability of luteal activity.  Mean serum levels decreased over the  last 3 months of CVR use, accounting for the increase in luteal activity and  possible ovulations in cycle 13.  Among women in Sydney, by contrast with women  in the other centers, a difference in the effect on lipids was seen.  However,  the changes in lipid levels were very small.  The side effects were a little  different from those experienced by women using a combined  pill.  Nausea and  vomiting were largely confined to early cycles and most common in the first days  of the first cycle.  Weight gain was also not a problem, although there was a  small mean increase in body weight over the 12-month treatment period.  This  study indicates that use of a single CVR releasing EE and NET-Ac over a period  of 12 months constitutes an acceptable, safe and effective contraceptive method.
Summary 2: A higher body weight appeared to be associated with increased likelihood of ovulation using the contraceptive vaginal ring, though it did not lead to any pregnancies in a multicenter study.

Query: What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome?
Document: To assess the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, tolerability, and user acceptability of a novel combined contraceptive vaginal ring for up to 13 cycles. Healthy women requesting contraception were enrolled in this 1-year multicenter study. Each ring released 120 microg of etonogestrel and 15 microg of ethinylestradiol daily, and was used for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week ring-free period. A total of 2322 women started treatment and so formed the intent-to-treat population. Subjects were followed for 23,298 cycles, equivalent to 1786 woman-years. Compliance was good with 85.6% of cycles in full compliance with specified criteria. In the intent-to-treat population, 21 pregnancies occurred, giving a Pearl Index of 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.73, 1.80). Eleven of the pregnancies were attributable to noncompliance; the Pearl Index for the per-protocol population was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.37, 1.40). The mean incidence of withdrawal bleeding was 98.5% in all cycles. Irregular bleeding occurred in 5.5% of all cycles, and in most women, early or late withdrawal bleeding was restricted to spotting. The ring was well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events; only 2.5% of all discontinuations were device related. The ring was easy to insert and remove and did not interfere with intercourse. Eighty-five percent of women were satisfied with the ring, and 90% would recommend its use to others. The ring is an effective contraceptive with excellent cycle control that is convenient, well tolerated, and highly acceptable to users.
Summary:","The efficacy of the contraceptive vaginal ring does not appear to be affected by body weight, but the mean BMI in intent-to-treat population studies was only 22.9±2.9."

Query 1: What are effective treatments for panic disorder?
Document 1: The etiology and optimum treatment of panic disorder remain unclear. Imipramine and alprazolam are reasonably well established treatments. Several reports have suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be effective for this condition. To investigate this issue, 27 published or presented placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of DSM-III or DSM-III-R panic disorder were subjected to meta-analysis. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors included paroxetine, fluvoxamine, zimelidine, and clomipramine. The standard treatments were imipramine or alprazolam. All three treatments were highly significantly superior to placebo in alleviating panic. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors were also significantly superior to both imipramine and alprazolam. The superiority of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors remained, but was less pronounced, when they were compared to the studies which used higher doses of imipramine or alprazolam. These findings underscore the importance of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of panic disorder and indirectly add to the evidence that serotonergic abnormalities may have a role in its etiology.
Summary 1: SSRIs were more effective than imipramine or alprazolam in a meta-analysis.

Query 2: What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome?
Document 2: Studies of antidepressants and psychological treatments in functional bowel disorders (FBD) are methodologically limited. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) against education (EDU) and desipramine (DES) against placebo (PLA) in female patients with moderate to severe FBD (irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, painful constipation, and unspecified FBD). We also evaluated the amenability of clinically meaningful subgroups to these treatments. This randomized, comparator-controlled, multicenter trial enrolled 431 adults from the University of North Carolina and the University of Toronto with moderate to severe symptoms of FBD. Participants received psychological (CBT vs. EDU) or antidepressant (DES vs. PLA) treatment for 12 weeks. Clinical, physiologic, and psychosocial assessments were performed before and at the end of treatment. The intention-to-treat analysis showed CBT as significantly more effective than EDU (P = 0.0001; responder rate, 70% CBT vs. 37% EDU; number needed to treat [NNT ], 3.1). DES did not show significant benefit over PLA in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.16; responder rate, 60% DES vs. 47% PLA; NNT, 8.1) but did show a statistically significant benefit in the per-protocol analysis (P = 0.01; responder rate, 73% DES vs. 49% PLA; NNT, 5.2), especially when participants with nondetectable blood levels of DES were excluded (P = 0.002). Improvement was best gauged by satisfaction with treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that DES was beneficial over PLA for moderate more than severe symptoms, abuse history, no depression, and diarrhea-predominant symptoms; CBT was beneficial over EDU for all subgroups except for depression. For female patients with moderate to severe FBD, CBT is effective and DES may be effective when taken adequately. Certain clinical subgroups are more or less amenable to these treatments.
Summary 2: A single-blinded study comparing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with patient education alone found cognitive-behavioral treatment more effective. The effect size was 0.50 (defined as moderate; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Analysis of response rates found that 73% responded to cognitive-behavioral treatment vs 41.3% in the education group (NNT=3.2).

Query: Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS?
Document: Clinical trials have demonstrated that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and the extract of Vitex agnus castus are effective for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study comparing the efficacy of the SRIs with Vitex agnus castus (AC) extract. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), with that of the AC extract, a natural choice. After a period of 2 screening months to screen the patients for suitability, 41 patients with PMDD according to DSM-IV were recruited into the study. The patients were randomized to fluoxetine or AC for 2 months of single-blind, rater- blinded and prospective treatment period. The outcome measures included the Penn daily symptom report (DSR), the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D), and the clinical global impression-severity of illness (CGI-SI) and -improvement (CGI-I) scales. At endpoint, using the clinical criterion for improvement, a similar percentage of patients responded to fluoxetine (68.4%, n = 13) and AC (57.9%, n = 11). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to the rate of responders. This preliminary study suggests that patients with PMDD respond well to treatment with both fluoxetine and AC. However, fluoxetine was more effective for psychological symptoms while the extract diminished the physical symptoms.
Summary:",A study comparing chasteberry tree with fluoxetine in 19 patients found a decrease in premenstrual symptom scores for both fluoxetine (13 of 19 patients) and chasteberry tree (11 of 19 patients). No statistically significant differences were noted between the 2 groups. Chasteberry tree was well tolerated; most adverse effects occurred in patients receiving fluoxetine. The most frequent adverse effects with chasteberry tree were nausea in 5 patients and headache in 4.

Query 1: Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS?
Document 1: In a prospective, multicentre trial the efficacy of an Vitex agnus castus L extract Ze 440 was investigated in 50 patients with pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). The patients were treated daily with one tablet (20 mg native extract) during three menstrual cycles. 43 patients completed the study protocol which encompassed 8 menstrual cycles (2 baseline, 3 treatment and 3 post-treatment). 13/43 patients were receiving concomitant oral contraceptives. 6 patients did not complete the study for reasons not related to study medication, and one patient complained of fatigue possibly related to study medication. All evaluated patients took at least 85% of the prescribed medication. The main effect parameter was the validated Moos' menstrual distress questionnaire (MMDQ), and secondary parameters were a visual analogue scale (VAS; self-assessment) and a global impression scale (GI, self-assessment). The study population was homogenous in age (31.3+/-7.7 years) weight (58.9+/-6.9 kg) and cycle length (28.4+/-0.3 d). The diagnosis was according to DMS-III. At the end of the study, PMS-related symptoms were reduced by treatment. There was a significant score reduction (42.5%) of the MMDQ as the main effect parameter (p<0.001). Symptoms gradually returned after treatment cessation. However, a difference from baseline remained (20%; p<0.001) up to 3 cycles thereafter. 20/43 patients were considered ""responders"", with a reduction in MMDQ score by at least 50% relative to baseline. At baseline, the VAS score was elevated in the late luteal phase and low at the follicular phase, as expected. During treatment, VAS score decreased in the late luteal phase (47.2%; p<0.01) and remained 21.7% (p<0.001) below baseline after 3 cycles post-cessation of treatment. The low VAS score within the follicular phase remained unchanged over the whole observation period. 38 patients judged the global efficacy moderate to excellent, 5 patients indicated no global efficacy. The number of days patients sustained PMS symptoms was reduced slightly from 7.5 to 6. Resting levels of blood prolactin remained within the physiological range throughout. No differences were seen between patients on or off oral contraceptives. 20 patients reported 37 adverse events (AE). No serious AE were reported. One patint withdrew after four days of treatment due to fatigue and headache. Laboratory safety control parameters were not affected. In conclusion, patients with PMS can be treated successfully with Vitex agnus-castus extract Ze 440, as indicated by clear improvement in the main effect parameter during treatment and the gradual return after cessation of treatment. The main response to treatment seems related to symptomatic relief rather than to the duration of the syndrome.
Summary 1: A prospective, open-label study of chasteberry tree for PMS symptoms in 43 patients found a 42% decrease in self-assessed PMS symptom scores, with the greatest improvement in pain, behavior changes, negative feelings, and fluid retention. No serious adverse events occurred.

Document 2: To determine the efficacy of calcium supplementation in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Randomized, double-blind crossover trial. Outpatient medical clinic of a large city hospital. Seventy-eight women were initially screened. Trial selection was based on a history of recurrent PMS symptoms and on the results of a prospective assessment of daily symptom scores. Only women with symptom scores during the late luteal phase that were at least 50% greater than those during the intermenstrual phase were selected. Thirty-three women completed the trial. A preliminary evaluation included physical examination, routine laboratory tests, dietary assessment, and psychiatric evaluation. Each participant received six months of treatment involving three months of daily calcium supplementation (1,000 mg of calcium carbonate) and three months of placebo. Efficacy was assessed prospectively by changes in daily symptom scores over a six-month period and retrospectively by an overall global assessment. Multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance on symptom ratings derived from daily PMS symptom scores demonstrated a reduction in symptoms on calcium treatment during both the luteal (p = 0.011) and the menstrual phases (p = 0.032) of the reproductive cycle. Calcium supplementation had no effect during the intermenstrual phase. Retrospective assessment of overall symptoms confirmed this reduction: 73% of the women reported fewer symptoms during the treatment phase on calcium, 15% preferred placebo, and 12% had no clear preference. Three premenstrual factors (negative affect [p = 0.045]; water retention [p = 0.003]; pain [p = 0.036]) and one menstrual factor (pain [p = 0.02]) were significantly alleviated by calcium. Calcium supplementation is a simple and effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome, but further studies will be needed to determine its precise role in PMS.
Summary 2: A randomized controlled trials (33 patients) comparing 1000 and 1200 mg of calcium with placebo found a significant decrease in PMS symptoms after 3 treatment cycles. Calcium improved negative affect, water retention, food cravings, and pain. In the study, 73% of patients preferred taking calcium, compared with 15% who preferred placebo.

Document: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of agnus castus fruit (Vitex agnus castus L extract Ze 440) with placebo for women with the premenstrual syndrome. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group comparison over three menstrual cycles. General medicine community clinics. Participants: 178 women were screened and 170 were evaluated (active 86; placebo 84). Mean age was 36 years, mean cycle length was 28 days, mean duration of menses was 4.5 days. Agnus castus (dry extract tablets) one tablet daily or matching placebo, given for three consecutive cycles. Main efficacy variable: change from baseline to end point (end of third cycle) in women's self assessment of irritability, mood alteration, anger, headache, breast fullness, and other menstrual symptoms including bloating. Secondary efficacy variables: changes in clinical global impression (severity of condition, global improvement, and risk or benefit) and responder rate (50% reduction in symptoms). Improvement in the main variable was greater in the active group compared with placebo group (P<0.001). Analysis of the secondary variables showed significant (P<0.001) superiority of active treatment in each of the three global impression items. Responder rates were 52% and 24% for active and placebo, respectively. Seven women reported mild adverse events (four active; three placebo), none of which caused discontinuation of treatment. Dry extract of agnus castus fruit is an effective and well tolerated treatment for the relief of symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome.
Summary:",A double-blind RCT comparing chasteberry tree with placebo in 170 patients found a decrease in self-reported PMS symptom scores and an increase in response rate (defined as a 50% reduction in symptoms)-52% vs 24%-in the intervention group (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.5). Patients taking chasteberry tree had 1 occurrence of multiple abscesses and 1 of urticaria.

Query 1: Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS?
Document 1: Conflicting data exist regarding the presence of magnesium (Mg) deficiency and the therapeutic efficacy of Mg in premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The % Mg retention was determined using 24-hour urinary Mg excretion and the total dose of Mg given intravenously. In women with (n = 17) and without (n = 14) prospectively diagnosed PMDD, several blood measures of Mg and mood were obtained before, immediately after, and the day following an intravenous Mg (.1 mmol/kg) loading dose. A positive mood response was seen under open conditions; as open Mg infusion improved mood, subsequent PMDD patients (n = 10) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. Patients (31.5%) and control subjects (27.5%) retained comparable mean percentages of Mg. Neither group differed in measures of mean Mg before, immediately after, or the day following Mg infusion. Although there was a time effect for all mood measures in the patient group (p < .01 for all), there was neither a treatment nor time-by-treatment effect. Contrary to prior reports, we found no evidence of Mg deficiency in women with PMDD compared with control subjects. Furthermore, Mg was not superior to placebo in the mitigation of mood symptoms in women with PMDD.
Summary 1: A study, begun as an open trial of magnesium infusion for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (N=6), found a dramatic reduction in mood symptom scores. After converting to a randomized, blinded design (N=10), no difference was found compared with placebo.

Document: We investigated the effect of a daily supplement of 200 mg of magnesium (as MgO) for two menstrual cycles on the severity of premenstrual symptoms in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A daily supplement of 200 mg of Mg (as MgO) or placebo was administered for two menstrual cycles to each volunteer, who kept a daily record of her symptoms, using a 4-point scale in a menstrual diary of 22 items. Symptoms were grouped into six categories: PMS-A (anxiety), PMS-C (craving), PMS-D (depression), PMS-H (hydration), PMS-O (other), and PMS-T (total overall symptoms). Urinary Mg output/24 hours was estimated from spot samples using the Mg/creatinine ratio. Analysis of variance for 38 women showed no effect of Mg supplementation compared with placebo in any category in the first month of supplementation. In the second month there was a greater reduction (p = 0.009) of symptoms of PMS-H (weight gain, swelling of extremities, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating) with Mg supplementation compared with placebo. Compliance to supplementation was confirmed by the greater mean estimated 24-hour urinary output of Mg (p = 0.013) during Mg supplementation (100.8 mg) compared with placebo (74.1 mg). A daily supplement of 200 mg of Mg (as MgO) reduced mild premenstrual symptoms of fluid retention in the second cycle of administration.
Summary:","A RCT comparing magnesium with placebo had low precision because of small numbers and short treatment duration. The study reported a decrease in fluid retention symptoms by 2 points on an 80-point scale (P<.009) at 2 months, but no difference in total score."

Query 1: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 1: The addition of lithium to the treatment regimens of previously nonresponding depressed patients has been repeatedly investigated in controlled studies. The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of > or = 0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.
Summary 1: Evidence from a meta-analysis with aggregate data from 3 studies representing a total of 110 patients showed that augmentation of various antidepressants with lithium leads to improved outcomes (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.7).

Query 2: Can nonantidepressants help treat depression?
Document 2: The delayed onset of therapeutic response and the high number of nonresponders to antidepressants remain major clinical problems in depressive disorders. Among the strategies to overcome both dilemmas, the additional treatment with lithium has been suggested as a viable method. The authors determined in 2 separate meta-analyses the efficacy of lithium in accelerating and in augmenting clinical response in patients with depression. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SOURCES: Two meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder, depressive phase, assessed the concomitant administration of lithium and antidepressant to accelerate or augment clinical response in the acute treatment phase of depression. Data were obtained from searching the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1989 to July 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). For the accelerating meta-analysis, subject headings including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, antidepressive agents, and lithium and text words such as depress*, lithium, and antidepress* were used. For the augmentation meta-analysis, subject headings included depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anti-depressive agents, lithium, drug therapy, and combination, and text words included augment*, refract*, and resistant. Outcomes investigated included response rates and depression scale rates. Five acceleration studies (231 participants) adding lithium to tricyclics and tetracyclics and 10 augmentation studies (269 participants) adding lithium to various antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were incorporated. In the acceleration meta-analysis, a statistical trend in favor of lithium was found (standardized mean difference of -0.43, 95% CI = -0.93 to 0.07). In the augmentation meta-analysis, lithium was significantly more effective than placebo (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.37). There is firm evidence for lithium as an effective augmentation strategy but only modest evidence for lithium to accelerate response to antidepressants in patients with depressive disorders.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 10 augmentation studies reported that adding lithium to various antidepressant agents increased the chances of clinical response 3-fold relative to placebo (odds ratio [OR]=3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-5.37), yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5. The mean response rate was 41.2% in the lithium group and 14.4% in the placebo group (P<.001). The meta-analysis included only RCTs that enrolled subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder (depressive phase) who were treated with any antidepressant plus lithium in any dose compared with placebo.

Query 1: Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy?
Document 1: The safety of sulfonamide nonantibiotics is unclear in patients with prior allergic reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom, examining the risk of allergic reactions within 30 days after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Patients with evidence of prior hypersensitivity after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic were compared with those without such evidence. Similar analyses were also performed with the use of penicillins instead of sulfonamides, to determine whether any risk was specific to sulfonamide cross-reactivity. Of 969 patients with an allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 96 (9.9 percent) had an allergic reaction after subsequently receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Of 19,257 who had no allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 315 (1.6 percent) had an allergic reaction after receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 3.7). However, the risk of allergic reactions was even greater after the receipt of a penicillin among patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic, as compared with patients with no such history (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 4.3). Furthermore, among those with a prior hypersensitivity reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic, the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower than the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a penicillin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.9). Finally, the risk of an allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics than among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillins (adjusted odds ratio, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.8). There is an association between hypersensitivity after the receipt of sulfonamide antibiotics and a subsequent allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, but this association appears to be due to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than to cross-reactivity with sulfonamide-based drugs.
Summary 1: A large retrospective cohort study using Britain's General Practice Research Database identified 20,226 patients seen from 1987 through March 1999 who were prescribed a systemic sulfonamide antibiotic, and then at least 60 days later received a nonantibiotic sulfonamide (eg, thiazide diuretic, furosemide, oral hypoglycemic). Researchers reviewed records to determine whether patients described as having an allergic reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic were at increased risk of having a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. researchers identified allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics in 969 patients. Of this group, 96 patients (9.9%) had a subsequent reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, which included drugs from the loop and thiazide diuretic classes (including bumetanide, chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and torsemide). It was unclear if any patients taking a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor experienced an allergic reaction. For comparison purposes, of the 19,257 patients who were not identified as having an allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic, again using the broad definition, 315 (1.6%), had a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-8.4). When the results were adjusted for age, sex, history of asthma, use of medications for asthma or corticosteroids, the adjusted odds ratio for individuals experiencing an allergy to a nonantibiotic sulfonamide in those persons with a history of allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic was 2.8 (95 % CI, 2.1-3.7). Of note, the adjusted odds ratio for the occurrence of a penicillin allergy in a patient with a history of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy was significantly higher at 3.9 (95% CI, 3.5-4.3)

Query 2: Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy?
Document 2: Celecoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole derivative containing a sulfonamide substituent. Because of this structural component, celecoxib is contraindicated for use in patients who have demonstrated allergic reactions to sulfonamides. However, there is a lack of data demonstrating cross-reactivity among sulfonamide medications. A sulfonamide is any compound with an SO2NH2 moiety. The major difference between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide-containing medications such as furosemide, thiazide diuretics and celecoxib, is that sulfonamide antimicrobials contain an aromatic amine group at the N4 position. This allows for division of the sulfonamides into 2 groups: aromatic amines (i.e., sulfonamide antimicrobials) and nonaromatic amines. In addition, sulfonamide antimicrobials contain a substituted ring at the N1-position; this group is not found with nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamides. Adverse reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials include type I, or immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated reactions, hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, and severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. The aromatic amine portion of the sulfonamide antimicrobial is considered to be critical in the development of latter 2 reactions. In susceptible individuals, the hydroxylamine metabolite is unable to be detoxified leading to a cascade of cytotoxic and immunological events that eventually results in the adverse reaction. Since celecoxib does not contain the aromatic amine, adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome reactions and toxic epidermal necrolysis would not be expected to occur at the same frequency as they do with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Similarly, for IgE-mediated reactions, the N1-substituent and not the sulphonamide moiety is important in determining specificity to antibodies. Celecoxib and other nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamide medications do not contain the N1-substituent. Cross-reactivity among the various sulfonamide-containing medications has also not been substantiated by published case reports. In fact, conflicting information exists in the literature. Reports showing lack of cross-reactivity balance the few case reports suggesting cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity between sulfonamide medications should be based on scientific data, including chemistry, metabolism, immune responses and clinical data. Based on the current information, there is no documentation for cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide medications, such as celecoxib.
Summary 2: In a literature review-in which the main focus was cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and celecoxib-the authors concluded that little evidence supported definitive cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and diuretics.

Query: Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy?
Document: To provide a critical and comprehensive review of the literature, specifically case reports and observational studies used to support the concept of cross-reactivity between sulfonylarylamines and non-sulfonylarylamines. A list of medications was formulated from several different review articles. A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted (1966-March 2004) using the individual medications and the MeSH terms of drug hypersensitivity/etiology, sulfonamides/adverse effects, and/or cross-reaction. A critical review of the methodology and conclusions for each article found in the search was conducted. The manufacturer's package insert (MPI) for each drug was examined for a statement concerning possible cross-reactivity in patients with a sulfonamide allergy. If indicated, the manufacturers were contacted to obtain any clinical data supporting the statement. A total of 33 medications were identified. Seventeen (51.5%) of the MPIs contained statements of varying degrees concerning use in patients with a ""sulfonamide"" allergy; 21 case series, case reports, and other articles were found. After a thorough critique of the literature, it appears that the dogma of sulfonylarylamine cross-reactivity with non-sulfonylarylamines is not supported by the data. While many of the case reports on the surface support the concept of cross-reactivity, on closer examination the level of evidence in many of the cases does not conclusively support either a connection or an association between the observed cause and effect.
Summary:","A literature review of Medline from 1966 to early 2004 revealed 21 case series, case reports, and ""other articles"" that evaluated the presence of cross-reactivity. When the authors of this literature reviewed drilled down to diuretics, they found 5 case reports for cross-reactivity to acetazolamide, 2 case reports for furosemide, 1 case series, and 2 case reports for indapamide (a thiazide diuretic). After reviewing the studies, the authors concluded that little evidence suggested a problem with cross-reactivity either with acetazolamide or furosemide and that there may be an association of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and indapamide. This study was limited by its small numbers and lack of explicit critical appraisal."

There is an association between hypersensitivity after the receipt of sulfonamide antibiotics and a subsequent allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, but this association appears to be due to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than to cross-reactivity with sulfonamide-based drugs.
Summary 1: A large retrospective cohort study using Britain's General Practice Research Database identified 20,226 patients seen from 1987 through March 1999 who were prescribed a systemic sulfonamide antibiotic, and then at least 60 days later received a nonantibiotic sulfonamide (eg, thiazide diuretic, furosemide, oral hypoglycemic). Researchers reviewed records to determine whether patients described as having an allergic reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic were at increased risk of having a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. researchers identified allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics in 969 patients. Of this group, 96 patients (9.9%) had a subsequent reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, which included drugs from the loop and thiazide diuretic classes (including bumetanide, chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and torsemide). It was unclear if any patients taking a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor experienced an allergic reaction. For comparison purposes, of the 19,257 patients who were not identified as having an allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic, again using the broad definition, 315 (1.6%), had a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-8.4). When the results were adjusted for age, sex, history of asthma, use of medications for asthma or corticosteroids, the adjusted odds ratio for individuals experiencing an allergy to a nonantibiotic sulfonamide in those persons with a history of allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic was 2.8 (95 % CI, 2.1-3.7). Of note, the adjusted odds ratio for the occurrence of a penicillin allergy in a patient with a history of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy was significantly higher at 3.9 (95% CI, 3.5-4.3)

Query 2: Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy?
Document 2: Celecoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole derivative containing a sulfonamide substituent. Because of this structural component, celecoxib is contraindicated for use in patients who have demonstrated allergic reactions to sulfonamides. However, there is a lack of data demonstrating cross-reactivity among sulfonamide medications. A sulfonamide is any compound with an SO2NH2 moiety. The major difference between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide-containing medications such as furosemide, thiazide diuretics and celecoxib, is that sulfonamide antimicrobials contain an aromatic amine group at the N4 position. This allows for division of the sulfonamides into 2 groups: aromatic amines (i.e., sulfonamide antimicrobials) and nonaromatic amines. In addition, sulfonamide antimicrobials contain a substituted ring at the N1-position; this group is not found with nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamides. Adverse reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials include type I, or immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated reactions, hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, and severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. The aromatic amine portion of the sulfonamide antimicrobial is considered to be critical in the development of latter 2 reactions. In susceptible individuals, the hydroxylamine metabolite is unable to be detoxified leading to a cascade of cytotoxic and immunological events that eventually results in the adverse reaction. Since celecoxib does not contain the aromatic amine, adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome reactions and toxic epidermal necrolysis would not be expected to occur at the same frequency as they do with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Similarly, for IgE-mediated reactions, the N1-substituent and not the sulphonamide moiety is important in determining specificity to antibodies. Celecoxib and other nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamide medications do not contain the N1-substituent. Cross-reactivity among the various sulfonamide-containing medications has also not been substantiated by published case reports. In fact, conflicting information exists in the literature. Reports showing lack of cross-reactivity balance the few case reports suggesting cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity between sulfonamide medications should be based on scientific data, including chemistry, metabolism, immune responses and clinical data. Based on the current information, there is no documentation for cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide medications, such as celecoxib.
Summary 2: In a literature review-in which the main focus was cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and celecoxib-the authors concluded that little evidence supported definitive cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and diuretics.

Query: Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy?
Document: To determine whether acetazolamide or furosemide produce allergic cross-reactions in patients with self-reported ""sulfa allergy."" Retrospective case series. A retrospective review included patients with intracranial hypertension and a self-reported sulfa allergy treated with either acetazolamide or furosemide seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from 1972 to 2003. All presumed medication-related side effects were collected, including both predictable adverse effects (for example, paresthesias, fatigue) and unpredictable adverse reactions (for example, cutaneous fixed eruptions, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, anaphylaxis). We reviewed 363 charts. Of these, 329 patients (91%) were excluded. Of the remaining 34 cases that did report a so-called sulfa allergy, 13 (38%) received acetazolamide alone, 7 (21%) received furosemide alone, and 14 (41%) received both acetazolamide and furosemide. Of the 27 patients who received acetazolamide, 10 (37%) had no documented allergic cross-reaction to sulfa, and 2 (7%) cases had urticaria. The remaining 15 (56%) of acetazolamide-treated patients experienced predictable adverse reactions for this drug (for example, paresthesias). No patient experienced a severe allergic cross-reaction to sulfa. Of 21 patients who received furosemide, no unpredictable adverse reactions or allergic cross-reactions to sulfa were noted. We find little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy is likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide. These medications should be considered for intracranial hypertension if the risk-to-benefit ratio warrants their use.
Summary:","Researchers involved in a retrospective study of 363 hospital charts examined 34 patients with a self-reported history of sulfa allergy who were subsequently given acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), furosemide (a loop diuretic), or both. The nature of the self-reported sulfa allergic reaction was documented in 79% of the 34 patients. These reported reactions included urticarial rash, nonspecified rash, dyspnea, swelling, nausea or vomiting, throat swelling, red eyes, and bullae. Two patients who were given acetazolamide developed urticaria. No allergic reactions occurred for those patients given furosemide. The researchers concluded that there was little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy was likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide. Small numbers and the lack of a standard definition for an allergic reaction limited the strength of their conclusion."

Query 1: When should a chest x-ray be used to evaluate acute-onset productive cough for adults?
Document 1: Cough is the fifth most common reason for physician visits, but data on acute cough have rarely been collected in a standardized manner and have not been analyzed in a multivariate fashion. We report data on 1819 patients presenting with cough, all of whom received a standardized history and physical, and a chest X-ray. Only 48 (2.6%) were found to have an acute radiographic infiltrate (pneumonia). The prevalence of common signs and symptoms is shown for the patients with and without pneumonia. Thirty-two of these findings were significant predictors of pneumonia (p less than 0.05, one-tailed). These 32 did not include some of the expected predictors of pneumonia and did include some predictors not previously described in the literature. A diagnostic rule is developed which identifies pneumonia patients with 91% sensitivity and 40% specificity, or 74% sensitivity and 70% specificity. The study results suggest that many pneumonias could be predicted based only on the patients histories. Physician visits to determine physical findings and chest X-rays might be avoided by telephone triage, with substantial cost savings.
Summary 1: Individual clinical findings such as pulse above 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate above 25 breaths per minute, temperature above 99.9ºF, local dullness to percussion, rales, asymmetric respirations, pleural rubs, egophony, increased fremitus, and cachexia are weak predictors of pneumonia, being present in 4% to 28% of radiographically proven pneumonia. Individual symptoms such as chills, night sweats, fever, and sputum production are found in 31% to 79% of those with pneumonia, but also in 18% to 62% of those without pneumonia. Therefore prediction rules, using combinations of statistically significant factors, have been developed to help us decide when to order a chest x-ray to diagnose pneumonia.

Query 2: What is the best approach to the evaluation and treatment of chronic cough?
Document 2: Chronic cough is a common problem in patients who visit family physicians. The three most common causes of chronic cough in those who are referred to pulmonary specialists are postnasal drip, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux. The initial treatment of patients with cough is often empiric and may involve a trial of decongestants, bronchodilators or histamine H2 antagonists, as monotherapy or in combination. If a therapeutic trial is not successful, sequential diagnostic testing including chest radiograph, purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis, computed tomography of the sinuses, methacholine challenge test or barium swallow may be indicated. By using a standard protocol for diagnosis and treatment, 90 percent of patients with chronic cough can be managed successfully in the family physician's office. However, in some cases it may take three to five months to determine a diagnosis and effective treatment. For the minority of patients in whom this diagnostic approach is unsuccessful, consultation with a pulmonary specialist is appropriate.
Summary 2: The protocol evaluates for these 3 conditions. The key weakness of the protocol is that a positive diagnostic test result does not mean that treatment for that condition will relieve the cough.5 Recently, empiric treatment before diagnostic testing has been recommended for primary care.

Query: What's the best diagnostic evaluation of night sweats?
Document: Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans and bone marrow biopsy.
Summary:","One reasonable algorithm recommends an initial work-up including a complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level, a purified protein derivative (PPD) and HIV test, and a chest x-ray. If the results are unrevealing, a trial of antireflux medication is recommended. If the patient does not improve, consider a diary of nocturnal temperatures to help discern the presence or absence of febrile pulses and further evaluate for suspected endocarditis or lymphoma."

Query 1: Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS?
Document 1: To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin B-6 in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Systematic review of published and unpublished randomised placebo controlled trials of the effectiveness of vitamin B-6 in the management of premenstrual syndrome. Nine published trials representing 940 patients with premenstrual syndrome. Proportion of women whose overall premenstrual symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. A secondary analysis was performed on the proportion of women whose premenstrual depressive symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in overall premenstrual symptoms was 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 2.54). Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in depressive symptoms was 1.69 (1.39 to 2.06) from four trials representing 541 patients. Conclusions are limited by the low quality of most of the trials included. Results suggest that doses of vitamin B-6 up to 100 mg/day are likely to be of benefit in treating premenstrual symptoms and premenstrual depression.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of pyridoxine in doses from 50 to 600 mg per day for PMS included 9 RCTs. Relative to placebo, pyridoxine improved PMS symptom scores (odds ratio=2.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.95-2.54). The overall quality of studies was poor, however, with few subjects, widely varying doses, and different outcome measurements.

Query 2: Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy?
Document 2: Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials. To determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial. Outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers. A total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years. Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered. Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38). During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.
Summary 2: The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) examined the effects of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease. HERS was a large randomized controlled trial of 2763 women with an average follow-up time of 4.1 years. It showed no statistically significant difference between the hormone replacement therapy (estrogen plus medroxyprog-esterone) group compared with the placebo group in either the primary outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death) or in the secondary outcomes (coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease).

Query: What's the best diagnostic evaluation of night sweats?
Document: Clinical experience suggests that reflexology may have beneficial effects on the symptoms occurring in menopausal women, particularly psychological symptoms. This study aims to examine that effect rigorously. Randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. School of Complementary Health in Exeter, Devon, UK. Seventy-six women, aged between 45 and 60 years, reporting menopausal symptoms. Women were randomised to receive nine sessions of either reflexology or nonspecific foot massage (control) by four qualified reflexologists given over a period of 19 weeks. The Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), the primary measures being the subscores for anxiety and depression. Severity (visual analogue scale, VAS) and frequency of flushes and night sweats. Mean (SD) scores for anxiety fell from 0.43 (0.29) to 0.22 (0.25) in the reflexology group and from 0.37 (0.27) to 0.27 (0.29) in the control group over the course of treatment. Mean (SD) scores for depression fell from 0.37 (0.25) to 0.20 (0.24) in the reflexology group and from 0.36 (0.23) to 0.20 (0.21) in the control (foot massage) group over the same period. For both scores there was strong evidence of a time effect (P < 0.001) but no evidence of a time-group interaction (P > 0.2). Similar changes were found for severity of hot flushes and night sweats. In the control group, 14/37 believed they had not received true reflexology. Foot reflexology was not shown to be more effective than non-specific foot massage in the treatment of psychological symptoms occurring during the menopause.
Summary:",Neither primrose oil nor foot reflexology proved effective.

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document 1: This review was designed to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on effects of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children. A systematic review of published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on probiotics in the treatment or prevention of acute diarrhea defined as >3 loose or watery stools per 24 hours in infants and children. The use of probiotics as compared with placebo was associated with a significantly reduced risk of diarrhea lasting >3 days. The pooled estimate risk was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.34-0.53) with a fixed-effect model, and remained significant in a random-effect model (0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.57). Only Lactobacillus GG showed a consistent effect. Probiotics significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea when compared with placebo, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis-the pooled, weighted, mean difference (WMD) assuming the random-effect model was -20.1 hours (95% CI, -26.1 to -14.2) and -24.8 (95% CI, -31.8 to -17.9) respectively. A meta-analysis of the prevention studies was not feasible because of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity. There is evidence of a clinically significant benefit of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis. Lactobacillus GG showed the most consistent effect, although other probiotic strains may also be effective. Further research is needed. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the prophylactic interventions preclude drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics in preventing acute gastroenteritis.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children. Lactobacillus supplementation reduced the risk of diarrhea persisting more than 3 days (relative risk [RR]=0.43; 95% CI, 0.34-0.53; P<.001; number needed to treat [NNT]=4).

Query 2: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document 2: This article reviews and synthesizes evidence in the published literature on the safety and efficacy of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) among young children with pediatric gastroenteritis in developed nations. We searched the literature for randomized, controlled trials comparing the safety and efficacy of ORT with intravenous (IV) rehydration treatment and/or oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) of different sodium content. We combined the failure rates of each set of studies in statistical meta-analyses and conducted tests of homogeneity of treatment effect over all the studies and for subgroups of children defined by the trial type, the sodium content of the ORS, and the setting of care. We also conducted a multivariate logistic regression on the probability of failure to determine the relative importance of these factors, controlling for other characteristics of the trials. Other outcomes were also tabulated and discussed. These include the relative incidence of hypernatremia and hyponatremia induced by treatment; weight gain; the volume, frequency, and duration of diarrhea; for inpatient trials, the length of stay; and for outpatient trials, rates of hospitalization. The evidence suggests that among pediatric patients with gastroenteritis in developed countries, failure of ORT, defined as the need to rehydrate children intravenously, is infrequent. We found a combined overall ORT failure rate of 3.6%. We found no statistically significant difference in failure rates by trial type or the sodium content of the ORS. However, we did find some supporting evidence for a lower failure rate among children treated in outpatient settings. In addition, compared with patients rehydrated intravenously, pediatric patients treated with ORT were not found to be at higher risk of iatrogenic hypernatremia or hyponatremia. The evidence from the literature fails to show a consistent trend in favor of either high- or low-sodium solutions for rehydration of pediatric patients. There seems to be a great potential for improving the medical treatment of children with acute gastroenteritis by the greater use of ORT.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developed countries demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral fluids compared with IV fluids, with an overall failure rate of only 3.6% for infants and children treated with oral rehydrating solution (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.8). There was no significant difference between oral rehydrating solution of varying sodium concentrations, and no increased risk of hypernatremia or hyponatremia compared with the IV treatment arm.

Query: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document: Childhood diarrhea accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Multiple studies in children have shown that Lactobacillus, administered orally, may have antidiarrheal properties. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies to assess whether treatment with Lactobacillus improves clinical outcomes in children with acute infectious diarrhea. Studies were sought in bibliographic databases of traditional biomedical as well as complementary and alternative medicine literature published from 1966 to 2000. Search terms were ""competitive inhibition,"" ""diarrhea,"" ""gastroenteritis,"" ""Lactobacillus,"" ""probiotic,"" ""rotavirus,"" and ""yog(h)urt."" We included studies that were adequately randomized, blinded, controlled trials in which the treatment group received Lactobacillus and the control group received an adequate placebo and that reported clinical outcome measures of diarrhea intensity. These inclusion criteria were applied by blind review and consensus. The original search yielded 26 studies, 9 of which met the criteria. Multiple observers independently extracted study characteristics and clinical outcomes. Data sufficient to perform meta-analysis of the effect of Lactobacillus on diarrhea duration and diarrhea frequency on day 2 were contained in 7 and 3 of the included studies, respectively. Summary point estimates indicate a reduction in diarrhea duration of 0.7 days (95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.2 days) and a reduction in diarrhea frequency of 1.6 stools on day 2 of treatment (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.6 fewer stools) in the participants who received Lactobacillus compared with those who received placebo. Details of treatment protocols varied among the studies. A preplanned subanalysis suggests a dose-effect relationship. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that Lactobacillus is safe and effective as a treatment for children with acute infectious diarrhea.
Summary:",An RCT showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children.

Query 1: How useful is ultrasound to evaluate patients with postmenopausal bleeding?
Document 1: Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a common clinical problem. Endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) is a noninvasive diagnostic test that may help determine which women should undergo endometrial biopsy. To determine the accuracy of EVUS in detecting endometrial disease in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding according to hormone replacement use. Literature search of English-language and non-English-language articles published from 1966 through November 1996 using MEDLINE and by a manual search of bibliographies of published articles. Studies were included if they prospectively collected EVUS measurements of endometrial thickness prior to obtaining endometrial tissue for histologic evaluation in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Of 85 studies that included data on EVUS and endometrial histology, 35 were included in the meta-analysis and included 5892 women. Articles were reviewed and independently selected and abstracted by 2 reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. The overall summary mean weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated for thresholds of endometrial thickness from 3 to 10 mm. Using a 5-mm threshold to define abnormal endometrial thickening, 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-98%) of women with cancer had an abnormal EVUS result, whereas 92% (95% CI, 90%-93%) of women with endometrial disease (cancer, polyp, or atypical hyperplasia) had an abnormal result. This did not vary by hormone replacement use. However, the number of women with normal histology who had an abnormal EVUS result did vary by hormone replacement use. In women who were not using hormone replacement therapy, 593 (8%) with normal histological findings had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 92%; 95% CI, 90%-94%), whereas 1544 (23%) using hormone replacement therapy had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 77%; 95% CI, 75%-79%). For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is 1% following a normal EVUS result. Endovaginal ultrasound has a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer and other endometrial disease and can reliably identify postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding who are highly unlikely to have significant endometrial disease so that endometrial sampling may be unnecessary.
Summary 1: A 1998 meta-analysis of 35 exploratory cohort studies published between 1966 and 1996 included a total of 5892 women with postmenopausal bleeding. transvaginal ultrasound evaluations were followed by endometrial tissue sampling and results were compared. Using endometrial thickness of ≤5 mm as the threshold, ultrasound was very accurate at ruling out patients with endometrial cancer but only fair at diagnosing cancer (likelihood ratio for a positive test [LR+]=2.5; likelihood ratio for a negative test [LR-]=0.06). In addition, the 5-mm threshold was accurate at ruling out any endometrial abnormality (cancer, polyp, atypical hyperplasia: LR- = 0.01). The authors suggested that transvaginal ultrasound can reliably rule out significant endometrial disease among postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding.

Query 2: What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy?
Document 2: The purpose of this study was to use transvaginal ultrasonographic measurements to find the thickness of the endometrium below which the risk of endometrial abnormality in women with postmenopausal bleeding is low. This multicenter study was carried out at eight clinics in four Nordic countries. The study included 1168 women with postmenopausal bleeding scheduled for curettage Before the curettage was performed, the thickness of the endometrium was measured with transvaginal ultrasonography. The measurement included both endometrial layers (double-layer technique). The transvaginal ultrasonographic measurement was compared with the histopathologic diagnosis of the curettage specimens. In women with atrophic endometrium the mean endometrial thickness (+/- SD) was 3.9 +/- 2.5 mm. The corresponding figures for women with endometrial cancer were 21.1 +/- 11.8 mm. No malignant endometrium was thinner than 5 mm. In 30 women (2.8%) it was not possible to measure the thickness of the endometrium; one of these women had endometrial cancer. The 95% confidence limit for the probability of excluding endometrial abnormality was 5.5% when the endometrial thickness was < or = 4 mm as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography. The risk of finding pathologic endometrium at curettage when the endometrium is < or = 4 mm as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography is 5.5%. Thus in women with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrium < or = 4 mm it would seem justified to refrain from curettage.
Summary 2: Any woman taking hormone replacement therapy who has irregular bleeding after a year should have a Pap test, since cervical abnormalities are not uncommon.

Query: How useful is ultrasound to evaluate patients with postmenopausal bleeding?
Document: A panel of 14 physicians practicing medicine in the United States with expertise in radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, hysteroscopy, epidemiology, and pathology was convened by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound to discuss the role of sonography in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Broad objectives of this conference were (1) to advance understanding of the utility of different diagnostic techniques for evaluating the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding; (2) to formulate useful and practical guidelines for evaluation of women with postmenopausal bleeding, specifically as it relates to the use of sonography; and (3) to offer suggestions for future research projects. October 24 and 25, 2000, Washington, DC, preceding the annual Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Advances in Sonography conference. Specific questions to the panel included the following: (1) What are the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using transvaginal sonography versus office (nondirected) endometrial biopsy as the initial examination for a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (2) What are the sonographic standards for evaluating a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (3) What are the abnormal sonographic findings in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (4) When should saline infusion sonohysterography or hysteroscopy be used in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding? (5) Should the diagnostic approach be modified for patients taking hormone replacement medications, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators? Consensus recommendations were used to create an algorithm for evaluating women with postmenopausal bleeding. All panelists agreed that because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. The panelists also agreed that either transvaginal sonography or endometrial biopsy could be used safely and effectively as the first diagnostic step. Whether sonography or endometrial biopsy is used initially depends on the physician's assessment of patient risk, the nature of the physician's practice, the availability of high-quality sonography, and patient preference. Similar sensitivities for detecting endometrial carcinoma are reported for transvaginal sonography when an endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is considered abnormal and for endometrial biopsy when ""sufficient"" tissue is obtained. Currently, with respect to mortality, morbidity, and quality-of-life end points, there are insufficient data to comment as to which approach is more effective. The conference concluded by identifying several important unanswered questions and suggestions that could be addressed by future research projects.
Summary:","A Consensus Conference Statement from the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound recommended that either TVUS or endometrial biopsy could be used in the initial evaluation of patients with postmenopausal bleeding. Using a threshold of >5 mm as abnormal, they concluded that the sensitivities of TVUS and endometrial biopsy are comparable when ""sufficient tissue"" is obtained with endometrial biopsy. They felt that data was currently insufficient to clearly state which technique is more effective."

Query 1: Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes?
Document 1: To compare the efficacy of local steroid injection and open carpal tunnel release, a symptom and functional status questionnaire (Boston Questionnaire) and sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were performed in 90 patients with electrophysiologically proven idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome, of whom 44 were treated surgically and 46 by two-dose steroid injection. Electrophysiologic studies and the Boston Questionnaire were applied before and at the 3rd and 6th months after treatment. Both groups showed significant improvement at first follow-up. The surgically treated group showed a significant and further improvement of symptoms and conduction values between the 3rd- and 6th-month evaluations, whereas no significant change was observed in the patient group treated by steroid injection. By the end of follow-up, 5% of the hands in the open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) group and 13% of the hands in the local steroid injection (LSIG) group showed electrophysiological worsening, and 5% of the hands in the OCTR group and 22% of the hands in the LSIG group showed symptomatic worsening. Our results show that steroid injection provides an improvement comparable with that from surgical release of the median nerve at a 3-month interval. However, this improvement is not long-lasting.
Summary 1: One cohort study of 90 patients concluded that with respect to symptom control and return to function, open release surgery was as effective as local steroid injection at 1 month follow-up.3 However, at 4 to 6 months after the operation, surgery patients were found to have significantly improved symptom and function scores, with continued improvement compared with patients who received the steroid injection. In this study the patients' pretreatment symptom and functioning scores were worse in the surgery group than in the nonsurgical group. The investigators in this study did not report controlling for these scores.

Query 2: Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes?
Document 2: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be treated with nonsurgical or surgical options. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of splinting and surgery for relieving the symptoms of CTS. A randomized controlled trial conducted from October 1998 to April 2000 at 13 neurological outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 176 patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were assigned to wrist splinting during the night for at least 6 weeks (89 patients) or open carpal tunnel release (87 patients); 147 patients (84%) completed the final follow-up assessment 18 months after randomization. General improvement, number of nights waking up due to symptoms, and severity of symptoms. In the intention-to-treat analyses, surgery was more effective than splinting on all outcome measures. The success rates (based on general improvement) after 3 months were 80% for the surgery group (62/78 patients) vs 54% for the splinting group (46/86 patients), which is a difference of 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-40%; P<.001). After 18 months, the success rates increased to 90% for the surgery group (61/68 patients) vs 75% for the splinting group (59/79 patients), which is a difference of 15% (95% CI, 3%-27%; P =.02). However, by that time 41% of patients (32/79) in the splint group had also received the surgery treatment. Treatment with open carpal tunnel release surgery resulted in better outcomes than treatment with wrist splinting for patients with CTS.
Summary 2: A well-designed randomized controlled trials of 176 patients published since that Cochrane review stated that with regard to overall improvement of symptoms and function status, surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome was more effective than wrist splinting 18 months posttreatment. The investigators found that surgery resulted in worse short-term outcomes at 1 month follow-up (29% vs 42% success), but by 3 months the improvement in all outcomes was greater in the surgery group (80% vs 54% success). The number needed to treat (NNT) over 18 months was only 2 patients in the treatment-received (per protocol) analysis (92% vs 37% success) and 7 in the intention-to-treat analysis (90% vs 75% success). Patients in the conservative treatment group who underwent surgery after splinting had failed had a higher success rate after 18 months follow-up than patients who did not have surgery (94% vs 62% success rate; number needed to treat = 3).

Query: Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes?
Document: A prospective, community-based, observational study of the outcome of surgical and nonoperative management was conducted. The study included 429 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome recruited in physicians' offices throughout Maine. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6, 18, and 30 months following presentation using validated scales that measured symptom severity, functional status, and satisfaction. Seventy-seven percent of eligible survivors from the original cohort were monitored for 30 months. Surgically treated patients demonstrated improvements of 1.2 to 1.6 points on the 5-point Symptom Severity and Functional Status scales (23% to 45% improvement in scores), which persisted over the 30-month follow-up period. The nonoperatively managed patients showed little change in clinical status at 6, 18, and 30 months. While workers' compensation recipients had worse outcomes than nonrecipients, 36 of 68 (53%) workers' compensation recipients were completely or very satisfied with the results of the procedure 30 months after surgery. There were no significant differences in outcome between patients treated with endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release. Among worker's compensation recipients, 12 of 68 (18%) surgical patients and 4 of 32 (13%) nonoperatively treated patients remained out of work because of carpal tunnel syndrome at 30 months. Thus, carpal tunnel surgery offered excellent symptom relief and functional improvement in this prospective community-based sample, irrespective of the surgical approach, even in workers' compensation recipients. Work absence remained high in both surgically and nonoperatively managed workers' compensation recipients.
Summary:","One cohort study of 429 patients found that surgery (open or closed endoscopic) was more effective with respect to symptom relief and functional status than various nonsurgical therapies (NSAIDs, splints, physical or occupational therapy, local steroid injections, work modification, or vitamin B6) at 30 months follow-up. In this study the patients' pretreatment symptom and functioning scores were worse in the surgery group than in the nonsurgical group. The authors controlled for functional status scores, but not for symptom severity."

Query 1: Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis?
Document 1: Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis (IM) occurring in 0.1-0.5 percent of patients with proven IM [1]. Although splenectomy has been advocated as the definitive therapy in the past, numerous recent reports have documented favorable outcomes with non-operative management. A review of the literature suggests that non-operative management can be successful if appropriate criteria, such as hemodynamic stability and transfusion requirements are applied in patient selection. We report the case of a 36 year old man with infectious mononucleosis who had a spontaneous splenic rupture and who was successfully managed by splenectomy. Based on review of the literature, an approach to management of a spontaneously ruptured spleen secondary to IM is suggested.
Summary 1: A review of 55 cases found almost all splenic ruptures occurred between the fourth and twenty-first days of illness, and that all affected spleens were enlarged, although only half were palpable on exam. Ninety percent of the ruptures occurred in males, and more than half were nontraumatic. There was no correlation between severity of illness and susceptibility to splenic rupture. No specifics were given on duration of illness or how splenomegaly was diagnosed.

Query 2: Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis?
Document 2: Spontaneous splenic rupture is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication of infectious mononucleosis in young adults. Although splenectomy remains effective treatment, reports of successful nonoperative management have challenged the time-honored approach of emergent laparotomy. On retrospective analysis of our institutional experience with 8,116 patients who had this disease during a 40-year period, we found 5 substantiated cases of atraumatic splenic rupture due to infectious mononucleosis. Four additional cases of suspected splenic rupture were noted. All nine patients were hospitalized and treated (seven underwent splenectomy and two were treated with supportive measures only), and they remain alive and well. In patients with infectious mononucleosis suspected of having rupture of the spleen, a rapid but thorough assessment and prompt implementation of appropriate management should minimize the associated morbidity and mortality. On the basis of review of the medical literature and careful scrutiny of our own experience, we advocate emergent splenectomy for spontaneous splenic rupture in patients with infectious mononucleosis.
Summary 2: A retrospective analysis of 8116 patients with infectious mononucleosis at the Mayo Clinic estimated the risk of spontaneous splenic rupture to be 0.1% of cases, correlating with rates found in other studies. The study's criteria for definite spontaneous rupture are: no recent trauma; recent symptoms; hematologic, serologic, and histologic (splenic) evidence of infectious mononucleosis. Five patients with rupture (average age, 22) were identified; 3 were male. Splenectomy was performed for all patients. Follow-up over 33-years found all patients healthy with minimal subsequent illness.

Query: Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis?
Document: The present study aims at an assessment of hepato-splenomegaly in infectious mononucleosis (IM). In 29 patients admitted to the ENT department with IM, based on the typical clinical and laboratory findings, including a positive mononucleosis test in most cases, the size of the liver and spleen was estimated by ultrasonic scanning on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 90 and 120 after admission. A control group of eight patients with peritonsillar abscess was included for comparison. The results showed that all patients had an enlarged spleen (mean enlargement: 50-60 per cent) but only a few were palpable. Half of the patients had enlargement of the liver (5-20 per cent), which was palpable in only 8 per cent. There was no correlation between the size of the spleen and that of the liver, not between the changes in the size of these organs. There was no enlargement of the liver or spleen in the control group. No correlation was found between the size, or changes in the size, of the organs and blood values such as lactatdehydrogenase and aspartatamino-transferase. There is, however, a striking parallelism between the curves for these parameters, which might indicate that the organs as well as the blood tests return to normal within 28 days. If this holds true, our warning to abstain from physical exercise and alcoholic intake may be limited to a period of about 1 month.
Summary:","In a case-control study, 29 patients were admitted to an ear, nose, and throat department with infectious mononucleosis and were evaluated serially for splenic and hepatic enlargement by ultrasound. Diagnosis was based on clinical picture, a positive heterophile test, and other blood tests. Four patients were included despite negative serology due to compelling clinical presentations and symptoms. Serial ultrasound imaging showed that all had enlarged spleens (mean enlargement 50%-60%); 50% had hepatic enlargement (5%-20% enlargement). The patients were compared with a control group of 8 patients admitted with peritonsillar abscess, as verified by tonsillectomy. No controls had hepatic or splenic enlargement. Physical examinations detected splenomegaly in only 17% of the study patients. The exams were conducted by house staff without blinding, randomization, or tests of reproducibility. Ultrasound scanning was completed on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 90, and 120. The spleen was significantly larger in the infectious mononucleosis group than in the control group for the first 30 days, and no difference in size was found over the subsequent 3 months. No correlation existed between laboratory values and enlargement of the spleen or liver."

Query 1: What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis?
Document 1: Infectious mononucleosis should be suspected in patients 10 to 30 years of age who present with sore throat and significant fatigue, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical or auricular adenopathy, marked adenopathy, or inguinal adenopathy. An atypical lymphocytosis of at least 20 percent or atypical lymphocytosis of at least 10 percent plus lymphocytosis of at least 50 percent strongly supports the diagnosis, as does a positive heterophile antibody test. False-negative results of heterophile antibody tests are relatively common early in the course of infection. Patients with negative results may have another infection, such as toxoplasmosis, streptococcal infection, cytomegalovirus infection, or another viral infection. Symptomatic treatment, the mainstay of care, includes adequate hydration, analgesics, antipyretics, and adequate rest. Bed rest should not be enforced, and the patient's energy level should guide activity. Corticosteroids, acyclovir, and antihistamines are not recommended for routine treatment of infectious mononucleosis, although corticosteroids may benefit patients with respiratory compromise or severe pharyngeal edema. Patients with infectious mononucleosis should be withdrawn from contact or collision sports for at least four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Fatigue, myalgias, and need for sleep may persist for several months after the acute infection has resolved.
Summary 1: The sensitivity of heterophile antibody testing is lower in children under 12 (25%-50%) and early in the illness (25% false-negative rate in first week).

Summary:","No quality studies evaluate the risks of physical activity in infectious mononucleosis. Case reports of rupture have found comparable rates between traumatic and nontraumatic causes. In addition, no clinical trials evaluate imaging in decisions regarding return to activity and its effect on splenic rupture. Ultrasound is often used in the athletic setting for these decisions but no evidence supports its use as routine practice. The routine use of ultrasound for this purpose would cost more than $1 million to prevent 1 traumatic rupture."

Query 1: Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis?
Document 1: To assess the effects of salazopyrin, auranofin, etretinate, fumaric acid, IMI gold, azathioprine, efamol marine and methotrexate, in psoriatic arthritis. We searched Medline up to February 2000, and Excerpta Medica (June 1974-95). Search terms were psoriasis, arthritis, therapy and/or controlled trial. This was supplemented by manually searching bibliographies of previously published reviews, conference proceedings, contacting drug companies and referring to the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register. All languages were included in the initial search. All randomized trials comparing salazopyrin, auranofin, etretinate, fumaric acid, IMI gold, azathioprine, and methotrexate, in psoriatic arthritis. Following a published a priori protocol, the main outcome measures included individual component variables derived from Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT). These include acute phase reactants, disability, pain, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, swollen joint count, tender joint count and radiographic changes of joints in any trial of one year or longer [Tugwell 1993], and the change in pooled disease index (DI). Only English trials were included in the review. Data were independently extracted from the published reports by two of the reviewers (MC, GJ). An independent blinded quality assessment was also performed. Twenty randomized trials were identified of which thirteen were included in the quantitative analysis with data from 1022 subjects. Although all agents were better than placebo, parenteral high dose methotrexate (not included), salazopyrin, azathioprine and etretinate were the agents that achieved statistical significance in a global index of disease activity (although it should be noted that only one component variable was available for azathioprine and only one trial was available for etretinate suggesting some caution is necessary in interpreting these results). Analysis of response in individual disease activity markers was more variable with considerable differences between different medications and responses. In all trials the placebo group improved over baseline (pooled improvement 0.39 DI units, 95% CI 0.26-0.54). There was insufficient data to examine toxicity. Parenteral high dose methotrexate and salazopyrin are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. The magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine, etretinate, oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. Furthermore, the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition.
Summary 1: A Cochrane systematic review identified 13 randomized controlled trials enrolling a combined 1022 patients with psoriatic arthritis randomly assigned to receive a DMARD-methotrexate, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), azathioprine (Imuran/ Azasan), or etretinate (Tegison; no longer available in the US)-compared with placebo. All agents were better than placebo; however, only 2 agents (parenteral high-dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine) had clinically important benefits for more than half the patients. The studies were too small to establish toxicity or to evaluate the other agents.

Query 2: What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy?
Document 2: To determine the relative efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the treatment of diabetic neuroapathy and postherpetic neuralgia, published reports were identified from a variety of electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and from two previously published reviews. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. The relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief was calculated from available dichotomous data, as was the relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-harm (NH) for minor adverse effects and drug related study withdrawal. In diabetic neuropathy, 16 reports compared antidepressants with placebo (491 patient episodes) and three compared anticonvulsants with placebo (321). The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief with antidepressants was 3.4 (95 % confidence interval 2.6-4. 7) and with anticonvulsants 2. 7 (2. 2-3. 8). In postherpetic neuralgia, three reports compared antidepressants with placebo (145 patient episodes) and one compared anticonvulsants with placebo (225), giving an NNT with antidepressants of 2.1 (1. 7-3) and with anticonvulsants 3.2 (2.4-5). There was little difference in the incidence of minor adverse effects with either antidepressants or anticonvulsants compared with placebo, with 1VH (minor) values of about 3. For drug-related study withdrawal, antidepressants had an NNH (major) of 17 (11-43) compared with placebo, whereas with anticonvulsants there was no significant difference from placebo. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants had the same efficacy and incidence of minor adverse effects in these tzoo neuropathic pain conditions. There was no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were better than older antidepressants, and no evidence that gabapentin was better than older anticonvulsants. In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.
Summary 2: Limited evidence suggests that SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo.

Query: What is the evaluation and treatment strategy for Raynaud's phenomenon?
Document: To determine the effects and toxicity of prazosin versus placebo proposed for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in scleroderma. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Medline up to December 1996 using the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy developed by Dickersin et al.(1994). Key words included: Raynaud's or vasospasm, scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis or connective tissue disease or autoimmune disease. Current Contents were searched up to and including April 7, 1997. All bibliographies of articles retrieved were searched and key experts in the area were contacted for additional and unpublished data. The initial search strategy included all languages. Randomized controlled trials comparing prazosin versus placebo were eligible if they reported clinical outcomes from the start of therapy. Trials with a greater than 35% dropout were excluded. Trials were included if patients with diffuse or limited scleroderma were the subjects. If patients with other connective tissue diseases or primary Raynaud's were included, the trial was used if the data on the scleroderma patients could be extracted from the paper. All data were abstracted by two independent and trained reviewers (DF, AT), and verified by a third reviewer (JP). Each trial was assessed independently by the same two reviewers for its quality using a validated quality assessment tool (Jadad 1996). Peto's odds ratios were calculated for all dichotomous outcomes and a weighted mean difference was carried out on all continuous outcomes. Fixed effects and random effects model were used if the data was homogeneous or heterogeneous, respectively. Two trials with a total of 40 patients were included. Prazosin has been found in two randomized controlled cross-over trials to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of Raynaud's secondary to scleroderma. However, the positive response is modest and side effects are not rare in those taking prazosin. Prazosin is modestly effective in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma.
Summary:","A systematic review of 2 randomized controlled trials with a total of 40 patients found prazosin modestly effective in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but it was less well-tolerated than calcium channel blockers."

Query 1: What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension?
Document 1: Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit. To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality. We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls. Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common. Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63-0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77-0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments. Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.
Summary 1: Several other clinical trials have subsequently compared the effect of thiazide diuretics with that of other antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers) on patient-oriented outcomes. These were analyzed in a recent meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials that included 192,478 patients randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo.

Query 2: Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes?
Document 2: The optimal treatment for hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effects of balloon angioplasty and medical therapy in these patients. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and reference lists. Authors of published trials were contacted. We identified three trials involving a total of 210 patients with moderate-to-severe (> or = 50%) unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension who were followed for at least 3 months after intervention. Balloon angioplasty was significantly more effective in reducing blood pressure than was medical therapy; the weighted mean difference between the two treatments was -7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -12 to -1 mm Hg) for systolic blood pressure and -3 mm Hg (95% CI: -6 to -1 mm Hg) for diastolic blood pressure. There was no consistent difference in changes in renal function. Patients treated with balloon angioplasty were more likely to have patent renal arteries after 12 months (52% vs. 19%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.8 to 9.8), used fewer antihypertensive medications, and appeared to have fewer major cardiovascular and renovascular complications (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.23; P = 0.09). Balloon angioplasty has a modest but significant effect on blood pressure and should be considered for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension. There is no evidence supporting its use in improving or preserving renal function, although none of the trials were designed to address this issue.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis (3 RCTs, total n=210 patients) examining balloon angioplasty for renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension showed modest but significant effect on blood pressure control.1 Comparing the angioplasty group with medical management, the mean reduction in blood pressure was -7 mm Hg systolic (95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -1) and -3 mm Hg diastolic (95% CI, -6 to -1). Patients treated with balloon angioplasty were more likely to use fewer antihypertensive medications (unable to synthesize data for quantity) and to have fewer major cardiovascular and renovascular complications (not defined specifically) (odds ratio [OR]=0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-1.23; P=.09).

Query: What is the evaluation and treatment strategy for Raynaud's phenomenon?
Document: Most patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) have Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), which is often more severe than idiopathic RP. This study was a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of calcium-channel blockers for the treatment of RP in SSc. The primary outcome measures were frequency and severity of ischemic attacks, digital skin temperature, patient and physician global assessments, and digital ulcers. The Cochrane search strategy was used to ascertain all trials in all languages. Primary data sources included Medline, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of >2 days' duration with a dropout rate of <35%. Twenty-nine studies were found, of which 8 randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. The total number of patients included was small (n = 109). Most trials included primary and secondary RP, and the main reasons for trial exclusion were inability to extract subset data on SSc patients (18 trials), data published previously (2 trials), and lack of a control group (1 trial). Data were abstracted independently by 2 reviewers, and either a weighted mean difference (WMD) or a standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for all continuous outcomes; however, information was not available for all outcomes within trials. The WMD of all calcium-channel blockers versus placebo (6 trials) and of nifedipine alone versus placebo (5 trials) for the reduction in the frequency of ischemic attacks over a 2-week period was -8.31 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -15.71, -0.91) and -10.21 (95% CI -20.09, -0.34), respectively. The SMD of all calcium-channel blockers versus placebo (3 trials) and of nifedipine alone versus placebo (2 trials) for the reduction in the severity of ischemic attacks was -0.69 (95% CI -1.21, -0.17) and -0.99 (95% CI -1.74, -0.24), respectively. Calcium-channel blockers for RP in SSc have been tested in several small clinical trials and appear to lead to significant clinical improvement in both the frequency and the severity of ischemic attacks. Most trials were crossover trials in which order effect was not studied. This could have introduced bias. The results of this study suggest that the efficacy of calcium-channel blockers in reducing the severity and frequency of ischemic attacks in RP secondary to SSc is moderate at best (mean reduction of 8.3 attacks in 2 weeks and 35% less severity), and a further large, randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted.
Summary:",A meta-analysis of 6 randomized crossover studies compared nifedipine or nicardipine with placebo in 59 patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and underlying systemic sclerosis. Nifedipine significantly decreased the frequency and severity of attacks. Nicardipine showed a trend towards reduced symptoms in 1 trial with only 15 patients.

Query 1: What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension?
Document 1: To delineate more precisely an operational threshold for making clinical decisions based on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement by studying the ABP in subjects who were diagnosed as either normotensive or hypertensive by conventional blood pressure (CBP) measurement. Twenty-four research groups recruited 7069 subjects. Of these, 4577 were normotensive (CBP < or = 140/90 mmHg), 719 were borderline hypertensive (systolic CBP 141-159 mmHg or diastolic CBP 91-94 mmHg) and 1773 were definitely hypertensive. Of the subjects in the last of these categories, 1324 had systolic hypertension (systolic CBP > or = 160 mmHg) and 1310 had diastolic hypertension (diastolic CBP > or = 95 mmHg). Hypertension had been diagnosed from the mean of two to nine (median two) CBP measurements obtained at one to three (median two) visits. The 95th centiles of the 24-h ABP distributions in the normotensive subjects were (systolic and diastolic, respectively) 133 and 82 mmHg. Of the subjects with systolic hypertension, 24% had 24-h systolic ABP < 133 mmHg. Similarly, 30% of those with diastolic hypertension had 24-h diastolic ABP < 82 mmHg. The probability that hypertensive subjects had 24-h ABP below these thresholds tended to increase with age and was two- to fourfold greater if the CBP of the subject had been measured at only one visit and if fewer than three CBP measurements had been averaged for establishing the diagnosis of hypertension. By contrast, for each 10-mmHg increment in systolic CBP, this probability decreased by 54% for 24-h systolic ABP and by 26% for 24-h diastolic ABP, and for each 5-mmHg increment in diastolic CBP it decreased by 6 and 9%, respectively. The ABP distributions of the normotensive subjects included in the present international database were not materially different from those in previous reports in the literature. One-fifth to more than one-third of hypertensive subjects had an ABP which was below the 95th centile of the ABP of normotensive subjects, but this proportion decreased if the hypertensive subjects had shown a higher CBP upon repeated measurement. The prognostic implications of elevated CBP in the presence of normal ABP remain to be determined.
Summary 1: A large international database of 2492 subjects found that women, older subjects, and those with lower and fewer office systolic blood pressure measurements were more likely to have white-coat hypertension.

Query 2: What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension?
Document 2: The rise in blood pressure (BP) associated with clinical visit (white coat effect) may be one basic mechanism of white coat hypertension (persistently raised clinic BP together with a normal BP outside the clinic), but the relations between white coat hypertension, white coat effect, and target organ damage have not yet been assessed on large populations. Thus, we performed 24-h noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring and 2D-guided M-mode echocardiography in 1,333 untreated subjects with essential hypertension and 178 control normotensive subjects. White coat hypertension was defined by an average daytime ambulatory BP < 131/86 mm Hg in women and < 136/87 mm Hg in men and its prevalence was 18.9% (n = 252). The white coat effect was calculated for systolic and diastolic BP as the difference between clinic BP and average daytime ambulatory BP. Echocardiographic left ventricular mass was slightly but not significantly greater in the group with white coat hypertension than in the normotensive group (93 v 87 g/m2, P = NS), and increased in the group with ambulatory hypertension (112 g/m2, P < .01). The prevalence of white coat hypertension markedly decreased from the first to the fourth Joint National Committee V (JNC V) stage of severity of hypertension (186/559 subjects (33%) in I; 59/501 (11%) in II; 7/230 (3%) in III; 0/43 (0%) in IV; P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: In another analysis of 1333 Italian subjects, the prevalence of white-coat hypertension was 33.3% in those with stage I hypertension, 11% with stage II, and 3 % with stage III.

Query: What is the best way to treat patients with white-coat hypertension?
Document: To determine the prognostic significance of ambulatory blood pressure, we prospectively followed for up to 7.5 years (mean, 3.2) 1187 subjects with essential hypertension and 205 healthy normotensive control subjects who had baseline off-therapy 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Prevalence of white coat hypertension, defined by an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure lower than 131/86 mm Hg in women and 136/87 mm Hg in men in clinically hypertensive subjects, was 19.2%. Cardiovascular morbidity, expressed as the number of combined fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events per 100 patient-years, was 0.47 in the normotensive group, 0.49 in the white coat hypertension group, 1.79 in dippers with ambulatory hypertension, and 4.99 in nondippers with ambulatory hypertension. After adjustment for traditional risk markers for cardiovascular disease, morbidity did not differ between the normotensive and white coat hypertension groups (P = .83). Compared with the white coat hypertension group, cardiovascular morbidity increased in ambulatory hypertension in dippers (relative risk, 3.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 12.5), with a further increase of morbidity in nondippers (relative risk, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 20.32). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (relative risk versus subjects with normal left ventricular mass, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.22), cardiovascular morbidity in ambulatory hypertension was higher (P = .0002) in nondippers than in dippers in women (relative risk, 6.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.45 to 18.82) but not in men (P = .91). Our findings suggest that ambulatory blood pressures stratifies cardiovascular risk in essential hypertension independent of clinic blood pressure and other traditional risk markers including echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary:","A prospective cohort study compared fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular event rates among patients who had white-coat hypertension, sustained hypertension, or were normotensive. Investigators performed 24-hour ABPM on 1187 patients who had clinic blood pressures over 140/90 on three visits. They found that 228 patients had white-coat hypertension, defined as mean ambulatory blood pressures below the 90th percentile of a normotensive population, and 959 patients had sustained hypertension. They followed these patients, along with 205 normotensive controls, for a mean of 3.2 years. Cardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly between normotensive and white-coat hypertension patients (P=.83), but the difference in event-free survival between the sustained hypertension group and both the white-coat hypertension and normotensive groups was highly significant (P=.002)."

Query 1: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document 1: There is a perception that the standard of care is to repair hip fractures surgically within 24 hours of hospitalization. However, it is unclear whether this reduces mortality or morbidity. We performed a retrospective study in consecutive hip fracture patients, aged 60 years or older, who underwent surgical repair. Patients with metastatic cancer, trauma, or a fracture occurring >48 hours before admission were excluded. The primary outcome was long-term (up to 18 years) mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and decubitus ulcers, serious bacterial infections, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Analyses were adjusted for medical conditions; the comparison group comprised patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture repair within 24 to 48 hours because there were no patients with active medical problems who underwent surgery within 24 hours. Of the 8383 patients, surgery was delayed for more than 24 hours in 2464 patients (29%) for medical reasons and in 1341 patients (16%) without active medical problems. Compared with those who underwent surgery 24 to 48 hours after admission to the hospital, patients who underwent surgery more than 96 hours after admission did not have increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95 to 1.21), although the risk of decubitus ulcer was increased (odds ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.1). There were no associations between time-to-surgery and the other secondary outcomes. Time-to-surgery in hip fracture patients was not associated with short- or long-term mortality after adjusting for active medical problems. Other than increasing the risk of decubitus ulcer formation, waiting did not appear to affect patients' outcomes adversely.
Summary 1: Some studies did not find decreased mortality with earlier surgical intervention. Complication rates (such as decubitus ulcers) increase with a delay in surgery.

Query 2: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document 2: We compared the mortality and outcome of 182 patients with proximal fractures of the femur after immediate and delayed surgical treatment. Seventy-nine patients were operated upon within six hours of the fracture (group 1) and 103 patients were operated upon after this period of time (group 2). At six months follow-up, group 1 had a significantly lower mortality rate. There was a good outcome in both groups with no differences in the outcome. Neither surgical nor anaesthetic factors appeared to have influenced mortality. The subdivision of groups revealed that patients operated on within 24 hours had a better outcome than those whose surgery was delayed. Although there may have been a bias, as patients were not randomly assigned to immediate or delayed surgical treatment, the data suggest that early stabilisation may be associated with a lower mortality rate. Even with pre-clinical delays of more than six hours early treatment should still be attempted, as better results seem to be achieved after 24 hours compared to a later time in our patients.
Summary 2: Some studies found decreased mortality with earlier surgical intervention.

Document: To estimate the number of deaths and readmissions associated with delay in operation after femoral fracture. Analysis of inpatient hospital episode statistics. NHS hospital trusts in England with at least 100 admissions for fractured neck of femur during the study period. Patients People aged > or = 65 admitted from home with fractured neck of femur and discharged between April 2001 and March 2004. In hospital mortality and emergency readmission within 28 days. There were 129,522 admissions for fractured neck of femur in 151 trusts with 18,508 deaths in hospital (14.3%). Delay in operation was associated with an increased risk of death in hospital, which was reduced but persisted after adjustment for comorbidity. For all deaths in hospital, the odds ratio for more than one day's delay relative to one day or less was 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.32) after adjustment for comorbidity. The proportion with more than two days' delay ranged from 1.1% to 62.4% between trusts. If death rates in patients with at most one day's delay had been repeated throughout all 151 trusts in this study, there would have been an average of 581 (478 to 683) fewer total deaths per year (9.4% of the total). There was little evidence of an association between delay and emergency readmission. Delay in operation is associated with an increased risk of death but not readmission after a fractured neck of femur, even with adjustment for comorbidity, and there is wide variation between trusts.
Summary:","A 2006 observational study found that delay in operating was associated with an increased risk of death in the hospital, even after adjusting for comorbidities. For all deaths in the hospital, the odds ratio [OR] for delaying more than 1 day, relative to 1 day or less, was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.32)"

Query 2: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document 2: Untreated pain is a major health care issue and very little is known about the treatment of pain and the effect of pain on post-operative outcomes in older adults. This study was performed to identify the impact of pain on outcomes following hip fracture in older adults. Four hundred and eleven consecutive cognitively intact patients admitted with hip fracture to four New York hospitals were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Patients were interviewed daily using standardized pain assessments. We used multiple logistic regression and ordinary least squares linear regression to examine the association of post-operative pain on immediate post-operative outcomes (duration of stay, physical therapy sessions missed or shortened, ambulation following surgery, and post-operative complications) and outcomes 6 months following fracture (locomotion, mortality, return to the community, residual pain). Patients with higher pain scores at rest had significantly longer hospital lengths of stay (P=0.03), were significantly more likely to have physical therapy sessions missed or shortened (P=0.002), were significantly less likely to be ambulating by post-operative day 3 (P<0.001), took significantly longer to ambulate past a bedside chair (P=0.01), and had significantly lower locomotion scores at 6 months (P=0.02). Pain at rest was not significantly associated with post-operative complications, nursing home placement, survival at 6 months, or residual pain at 6 months. Post-operative pain is associated with increased hospital length of stay, delayed ambulation, and long-term functional impairment. Whereas appropriate caution is warranted in administering opioid analgesics to older adults, these data suggest that improved pain control may decrease length of stay, enhance functional recovery, and improve long-term functional outcomes.
Summary 2: In a 2003 prospective cohort study, patients without sufficient analgesia had an increased risk of poor functional recovery and longer hospitalization.

Document: Until operative treatment involving the use of various implants was introduced in the 1950s, hip fractures were managed using conservative methods based on traction and bed rest. To compare conservative with operative treatment for fractures of the proximal femur (hip) in adults. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trials register and bibliographies of published papers, and contacted trialists. Date of the most recent search: August 1999. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing these two treatment methods in adults with hip fracture. Outcomes sought fell into four categories: a) fracture fixation complications, b) post-operative or clinical complications, c) anatomical restoration and d) final outcome measures including mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality, by use of an twelve item scale, and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by fracture type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped by implant type and where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed effects model. The five randomised trials identified involved only 425 elderly patients. One small and potentially biased trial of 23 patients with undisplaced intracapsular fracture showed a reduced risk of non-union for those fractures treated operatively. The four identified studies on extracapsular fractures tested a variety of surgical techniques and implant devices and only one trial involving 106 patients can be considered to test current practice. In this trial, no differences were found in medical complications, mortality and long-term pain. However, operative treatment was more likely to result in the fracture healing without leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay and a statistically non-significant increase in the return of patients back to their original residence. Given the lack of available evidence to inform practice and the continued variation in practice, good quality randomised trials of operative versus conservative treatment for undisplaced intracapsular fractures are warranted. The limited available evidence from randomised trials does not suggest major differences in outcome between conservative and operative management programmes for extracapsular femoral fractures, but operative treatment appears to be associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. However these results are derived mainly from one study. Conservative treatment will be acceptable where modern surgical facilities are unavailable, and will result in a reduction in complications associated with surgery, but rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity more common. Although further randomised trials would provide more robust data, they may be difficult to mount.
Summary:",A meta-analysis found few randomized trials comparing operative with nonoperative therapy; it concluded that surgical treatment seems to be associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation.

Query 1: Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip?
Document 1: Deep-vein thrombosis is a well-recognized complication after trauma to the legs and subsequent immobilization, but there are no generally accepted approaches to preventing this complication. We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous reviparin (1750 anti-Xa units given once daily) in 440 patients who required immobilization in a plaster cast or brace for at least five weeks after a leg fracture or rupture of the Achilles tendon. The study drug was given throughout the period of immobilization. Venography of the injured leg was performed within one week after removal of the plaster cast or brace, or earlier if there were symptoms suggesting deep-vein thrombosis. Data on efficacy and end points were available for 371 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 17 of the 183 patients randomly assigned to receive reviparin (9 percent) and in 35 of the 188 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo (19 percent) (odds ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.82). Most of the thromboses were distal (14 in the reviparin group and 25 in the placebo group). There were two cases of pulmonary embolism, both in patients in the placebo group who also had proximal deep-vein thrombosis. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding or other adverse events. Deep-vein thrombosis is common in persons with leg injury requiring prolonged immobilization. Reviparin given once daily appears to be effective and safe in reducing the risk of this complication.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials evaluated reviparin (another European LMWH) vs placebo in 440 outpatients with lower limb injuries, of whom 293 had fractures. About half had surgical management and all were treated with a plaster cast or brace for an average of 44 days. Most were ambulatory with crutches. All underwent venography within a week of cast removal. The deep venous thrombosis rate for fracture patients using reviparin was 10.4%, vs 18.2% among those without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis (absolute risk reduction=7.8%; NNT=12.8). Three fourths of the DVTs were in distal veins, and 21% of the DVTs in the low-molecular-weight heparin patients occurred in deep veins compared with 34% in patients without. Two pulmonary emboli occurred, both in patients without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis.

Document: Hip fracture patients have a high risk of thrombo-embolic complications following surgical management. To examine the effects of heparin (unfractionated (U), and low molecular weight (LMW) heparins), and physical methods (compression stockings, calf or foot pumps) for prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism after surgery for hip fracture in the elderly. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (up to March 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002), EMBASE (1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (1982 to February week 4 2002), Current Contents (1993 week 26 to 2002 week 12), reference lists of published articles and contacted trialists and other workers in the field. Date of most recent search: March 2002. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the use of heparins and physical agents for prevention of DVT and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Trials were grouped into five categories (heparin versus control, mechanical versus control, LMW heparin versus U heparin, heparin versus mechanical, and miscellaneous) and results pooled where possible. The 31 included trials involved at least 2958 predominantly female and elderly patients. Overall, trial quality was disappointing. Ten trials involving 826 patients which compared U heparin with control, and five trials of 373 patients which compared LMW heparin with control, showed a reduction in the incidence of lower limb DVT (124/474 (26%) versus 219/519 (42%); relative risk (RR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71). There were insufficient data to confirm the efficacy of either agent in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. There was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (42/356 (12%) versus 38/374 (10%); RR 1.16; 95%CI 0.77 to 1.74). Data were inadequate for all other outcomes including wound complications. There is insufficient evidence from five trials, involving 644 patients, to establish if LMW heparin was superior to U heparin. Most trials evaluating heparins had methodological defects. Five trials, involving 487 patients, testing mechanical pumping devices were also methodologically flawed, and so pooled results need to be viewed cautiously. Mechanical pumping devices may protect against DVT (16/221 (7%) versus 52/229 (22%); RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.51) and pulmonary embolism. Data were insufficient to establish any effect on the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism and overall mortality. Problems with skin abrasion and compliance were reported. U and LMW heparins protect against lower limb DVT. There is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin. Foot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent DVT, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem. Good quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered.
Summary:","The effectiveness of unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin was evaluated in a 2002 Cochrane systematic review. While evidence was insufficient to recommend 1 agent over another, both were found to significantly decrease the incidence of lower-extremity DVT over placebo (for unfractionated heparin, relative risk [RR]=0.59 [95% CI, 0.49-0.72]; for low-molecular-weight heparin, RR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.71]). Number needed to treat [NNT] with either agent was 7."

Query 1: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document 1: Randomized, controlled trials have shown that prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing surgical-wound infections. However, it is uncertain how the timing of antibiotic administration affects the risk of surgical-wound infection in actual clinical practice. We prospectively monitored the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis and studied the occurrence of surgical-wound infections in 2847 patients undergoing elective clean or ""clean-contaminated"" surgical procedures at a large community hospital. The administration of antibiotics 2 to 24 hours before the surgical incision was defined as early; that during the 2 hours before the incision, as preoperative; that during the 3 hours after the incision, as perioperative; and that more than 3 but less than 24 hours after the incision, as postoperative. Of the 1708 patients who received the prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively, 10 (0.6 percent) subsequently had surgical-wound infections. Of the 282 patients who received the antibiotics perioperatively, 4 (1.4 percent) had such infections (P = 0.12; relative risk as compared with the preoperatively treated group, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 7.9). Of 488 patients who received the antibiotics postoperatively, 16 (3.3 percent) had wound infections (P less than 0.0001; relative risk, 5.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 12.3). Finally, of 369 patients who had antibiotics administered early, 14 (3.8 percent) had wound infections (P less than 0.0001; relative risk, 6.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.7). Stepwise logistic-regression analysis confirmed that the administration of antibiotics in the preoperative period was associated with the lowest risk of surgical-wound infection. We conclude that in surgical practice there is considerable variation in the timing of prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that administration in the two hours before surgery reduces the risk of wound infection.
Summary 1: Classen et al found that patients treated less than 2 hours before surgery had a 0.6% rate of infection (10/1208), compared with a 3.85% rate for those treated 2 to 24 hours ahead (14/369) (NNT=31).

Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and decubitus ulcers, serious bacterial infections, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Analyses were adjusted for medical conditions; the comparison group comprised patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture repair within 24 to 48 hours because there were no patients with active medical problems who underwent surgery within 24 hours. Of the 8383 patients, surgery was delayed for more than 24 hours in 2464 patients (29%) for medical reasons and in 1341 patients (16%) without active medical problems. Compared with those who underwent surgery 24 to 48 hours after admission to the hospital, patients who underwent surgery more than 96 hours after admission did not have increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95 to 1.21), although the risk of decubitus ulcer was increased (odds ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.1). There were no associations between time-to-surgery and the other secondary outcomes. Time-to-surgery in hip fracture patients was not associated with short- or long-term mortality after adjusting for active medical problems. Other than increasing the risk of decubitus ulcer formation, waiting did not appear to affect patients' outcomes adversely.
Summary 2: Some studies did not find decreased mortality with earlier surgical intervention. Complication rates (such as decubitus ulcers) increase with a delay in surgery.

Query: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document: Surgical site infection and other hospital-acquired infections cause significant morbidity after internal fixation of fractures. The administration of antibiotics may reduce the frequency of infections. To determine whether the prophylactic administration of antibiotics in people undergoing surgical management of hip or other closed long bone fractures reduces the incidence of surgical site and other hospital-acquired infections. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1988 to December 2009), other electronic databases including the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (December 2009), conferences proceedings and reference lists of articles. Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any regimen of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis administered at the time of surgery, compared with no prophylaxis, placebo, or a regimen of different duration, in people with a hip fracture undergoing surgery for internal fixation or prosthetic replacement, or with any closed long bone fracture undergoing internal fixation. All trials needed to report surgical site infection. Two authors independently screened papers for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Pooled data are presented graphically. Data from 8447 participants in 23 studies were included in the analyses. In people undergoing surgery for closed fracture fixation, single dose antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67), superficial surgical site infections, urinary infections, and respiratory tract infections. Multiple dose prophylaxis had an effect of similar size on deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62), but significant effects on urinary and respiratory infections were not confirmed. Although the risk of bias in many studies as reported was unclear, sensitivity analysis showed that removal from the meta-analyses of studies at high risk of bias did not alter the conclusions. Economic modelling using data from one large trial indicated that single dose prophylaxis with ceftriaxone is a cost-effective intervention. Data for the incidence of adverse effects were very limited, but as expected they appeared to be more common in those receiving antibiotics, compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to those undergoing surgery for closed fracture fixation.
Summary:","Antibiotic prophylaxis has been supported by a Cochrane review, which concluded that single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery significantly reduced the risk of deep wound infections (RR=0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.67; NNT=55), as well as superficial wound, urinary, and respiratory tract infections."

Query 1: How can you best diagnose idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus?
Document 1: There are no currently accepted evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patient. As a result, an independent study group was assembled to address this issue and determine the feasibility of developing standardized guidelines, which would be acceptable in the United States and abroad and would be based on the available scientific evidence. The guidelines were to encompass value of clinical presentation, value of supplementary diagnostic tests, surgical management, and outcome assessment. Initially, a series of 10 questions were formulated in the areas of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment to obtain a consensus by panels of experts (see Acknowledgments) assembled in San Antonio, TX, in September 2000. This workshop provided significant insight into the difficulties in developing NPH guidelines, and a consensus was reached as to those questions involving expert opinion. Subsequently, evidentiary tables were developed on the basis of the available evidence. Only those studies with 20 or more idiopathic NPH (INPH) patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for INPH diagnostic criteria were assessed, and guidelines were developed on the basis of the available evidence. Recommendations for classification of INPH and additional studies were documented. The development of the guidelines was made difficult because systematic studies of INPH and patient numbers were few. It was decided to maintain the classification of NPH into two major categories, INPH and those of known cause (secondary NPH). Many studies ""mixed"" these classifications, and as a result, they could not be used in the evidentiary tables. Despite these problems, evidence-based guidelines were developed, and it is hoped that they will be useful in guiding clinical management of the INPH patient.
Summary 1: There is no definitive test or physical finding for INPH. For patients over 40 years of age, INPH has an insidious onset, a progressive course, and lacks an identifiable antecedent cause. A brain imaging study reveals ventricular enlargement not attributable to other causes. Some suggest that the diagnosis be assessed as ""probable"", ""possible"", and ""unlikely"" based on the degree of fulfillment of a set of historical, imaging, clinical, and physiological criteria.

Query 2: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document 2: Clinical criteria to select patients with headache in whom structural diagnostic studies (computed tomography) have a high yield disclosing intracranial pathologic findings, independent of abnormal findings on neurologic examination, have not been defined. To determine which clinical characteristics predict the presence of intracranial pathologic findings, independently of neurologic examination, in patients with headache. Case-control, consecutive sample. Major metropolitan trauma center emergency department. Hospital records of 139 hospitalized and 329 randomly selected patients from 1720 nonhospitalized adult patients, consecutively evaluated for headache in the emergency department, were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the headache, results of neurologic and physical examinations, and diagnostic radiologic and laboratory results were correlated with final diagnosis and outcome at 6 months after emergency department visit. Nonparametric statistical analysis. Intracranial pathologic findings were found in 18 (3.8%) of 468 patients. Acute onset and occipitonuchal location of headache, presence of associated symptoms, and patient age of 55 years or older were significantly associated with the finding of intracranial pathology, independently of the findings from neurologic examination. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination alone, whether focal or nonfocal, had a highly significant association and a positive predictive value for intracranial pathology of 39%. Abnormal results from neurologic examination are the best clinical parameters to predict structural intracranial pathology; however, in patients 55 years or older with headache of acute onset located in the occipitonuchal region that has associated symptoms, computed tomographic scan of the head is justified as part of their clinical evaluation independently of the findings of the neurologic examination.
Summary 2: A case-control study reviewed hospital records of 468 patients evaluated in the emergency department for nontraumatic headache. Neuroimaging (CT scan or cerebral angiogram) was performed for 160 of these patients. Final diagnosis and outcome was obtained at 6 months. The symptoms and their ability to predict intracranial pathology are as follows: abnormal neurologic examination (sensitivity=39%; LR+=19.5), location of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=4.87), age of patient (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), multiple associated symptoms (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), mode of onset of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=2.23), and presence of associated symptoms (sensitivity=89%; LR+=1.41). Again, abnormal neurologic examination was the most significant indicator for imaging. This study did not define associated symptoms nor did it specify what determined which patients were imaged.

Query: How can you best diagnose idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus?
Document: Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. Estimated to cause no more than 5 percent of cases of dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus often is treatable, and accurate recognition of the clinical triad coupled with radiographic evidence most commonly identifies likely responders. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography typically demonstrates ventricular dilation with preservation of the surrounding brain tissue. The abnormality in normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs secondary to an abnormality in fluid removal, leading to an increase in ventricular size and encroachment of enlarged ventricles on adjacent brain tissue. The pressure exerted on the cerebral parenchyma by immense fluid-filled cavities deforms white matter tracts, instigating gait abnormalities and incomplete control of the bladder, as well as difficulties in processing incoming stimulation and in producing expeditious responses. Signs and symptoms often occur as sequelae to an imbalance between the expected ongoing production of cerebrospinal fluid and continuous efflux. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is used to relieve excess ventricular fluid not absorbed by normal physiologic channels. Multiple studies have explored various techniques to identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus in an effort to predict likely benefit from shunting. However, the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid diversion has never been proven in a randomized controlled trial comparing use of a shunt versus no shunt.
Summary:","A systematic review of the most commonly used prognostic tests identified a response to a large-volume (40-50 mL) CSF tap test as having a positive predictive value (PPV) between 73% and 100% but a negative predictive value (NPV) of only 23% to 42%. Thus, observing an improvement of function after such a test is a good predictor of improvement after shunting, but many patients who do not respond to the test respond to shunting. A variation of the CSF tap test is the extended lumbar drainage test, which involves placing a lumbar intrathecal catheter and allowing the drainage of 10 mL of CSF/hour for 72 hours. The PPV for this test ranges from 80% to 100%, and NPV from 66% to 100%. A third possible test is the measurement of resistance to an infusion of saline into the lumbar subarachnoid space (CSF Ro test). This test has multiple variations of technique. Reported values for PPV are 75% to 92%, and for NPV of 27% to 92%. Other tests, such as radionuclide cisternography or magnetic resonance imaging CSF flow void, have predictive values too low or have too few studies to be recommended."

Query 1: Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis?
Document 1: A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etanercept to treat adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Adult patients with AS at 14 European sites were randomly assigned to 25 mg injections of etanercept or placebo twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was an improvement of at least 20% in patient reported symptoms, based on the multicomponent Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) response criteria (ASAS 20). Secondary end points included ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 responses and improved scores on individual components of ASAS, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), acute phase reactants, and spinal mobility tests. Safety was evaluated during scheduled visits. Of 84 patients enrolled, 45 received etanercept and 39 received placebo. Significantly more etanercept patients than placebo patients responded at the ASAS 20 level as early as week 2, and sustained differences were evident up to week 12. Significantly more etanercept patients reported ASAS 50 responses at all times and ASAS 70 responses at weeks 2, 4, and 8; reported lower composite and fatigue BASDAI scores; had lower acute phase reactant levels; and had improved spinal flexion. Etanercept was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate; the only between-group difference was injection site reactions, which occurred significantly more often in etanercept patients. Etanercept is a well tolerated and effective treatment for reducing clinical symptoms and signs of AS.
Summary 1: A study (84 patients) showed that 60% of patients on etanercept vs 20% on placebo had good clinical benefit at only 12 weeks (P<.001, NNT=2.5).

Query 2: Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis?
Document 2: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, autoimmune, seronegative inflammatory arthritis characterized by varying degrees of axial and peripheral arthritis. Here, we review the literature on the pharmacological management of PsA and present a simple treatment algorithm based on the available information. Although PsA management must be individualized to the degree and type of joint pain and inflammation, in general, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) still represent first-line treatment of mild PsA. Second-line therapy includes older agents such as gold salts, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and cyclosporine. The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists represent the most recent major advance in the clinical management of PsA.
Summary 2: NSAIDs are still the preferred first-line therapy, concluded a recent publication on the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, which looked at 54 different studies; however, second-line therapy could include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), cyclosporine, or combination therapy. Sulfasalazine appeared to be clinically beneficial for peripheral psoriatic arthritis.

Query: Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis?
Document: The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) respond inadequately to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in quite a number of patients. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have demonstrated success in reducing AS disease activity in a limited number of clinical trials. The objective of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with AS. Patients were randomly assigned to receive infusions of placebo or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18. Efficacy was assessed using the ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) International Working Group criteria, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), night pain, patient's global assessment, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), chest expansion, the Mander enthesis index, the total swollen joint index, the C-reactive protein level, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey questionnaire. The primary end point in this study was the proportion of patients with a 20% improvement response according to the ASAS International Working Group criteria (ASAS20 responders) at week 24. Of the 357 patients screened, 201 were assigned to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab and 78 were assigned to receive placebo. After 24 weeks, 61.2% of patients in the infliximab group were ASAS20 responders compared with 19.2% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Clinical benefit was observed in patients receiving infliximab as early as week 2 and was maintained over the 24-week study period. Patients receiving infliximab also showed significant improvements in the BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, chest expansion, and physical component summary score of the SF-36. Adverse events were reported by 82.2% of patients receiving infliximab and by 72.0% of patients receiving placebo; however, most adverse events in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. Infliximab was well tolerated and effective in a large cohort of patients with AS during a 24-week study period.
Summary:",One study of infliximab vs placebo showed 61.2% vs 19.2% patients with good clinical benefit at 24 weeks and only mild or moderate adverse events (P<.001; NNT=2.38).

Query: Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis?
Document: Standard therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) with cyclophosphamide (CYC) and prednisolone is limited by toxicity. This unblinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether methotrexate (MTX) could replace CYC in the early treatment of AASV. Patients with newly diagnosed AASV, with serum creatinine levels <150 mumoles/liter, and without critical organ manifestations of disease were randomized to receive either standard oral CYC, 2 mg/kg/day or oral MTX, 20-25 mg/week; both groups received the same prednisolone regimen. All drug treatments were gradually tapered and withdrawn by 12 months. Followup continued to 18 months. The primary end point was the remission rate at 6 months (noninferiority testing). One hundred patients were recruited from 26 European centers; 51 patients were randomized to the MTX group and 49 to the CYC group. At 6 months, the remission rate in patients treated with MTX (89.8%) was not inferior to that in patients treated with CYC (93.5%) (P = 0.041). In the MTX group, remission was delayed among patients with more extensive disease (P = 0.04) or pulmonary involvement (P = 0.03). Relapse rates at 18 months were 69.5% in the MTX group and 46.5% in the CYC group; the median time from remission to relapse was 13 months and 15 months, respectively (P = 0.023, log rank test). Two patients from each group died. Adverse events (mean 0.87 episodes/patient) included leukopenia, which was less frequent in the MTX versus the CYC group (P = 0.012), and liver dysfunction, which was more frequent in the MTX group (P = 0.036). MTX can replace CYC for initial treatment of early AASV. The MTX regimen used in the present study was less effective for induction of remission in patients with extensive disease and pulmonary involvement and was associated with more relapses than the CYC regimen after termination of treatment. The high relapse rates in both treatment arms support the practice of continuation of immunosuppressive treatment beyond 12 months.
Summary:",A recent randomized controlled trial of 100 patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis showed methotrexate may be able to replace cyclosporine for both induction of remission (methotrexate=89.8% vs cyclosporine=93.5%; P=.041) and maintenance of remission (69.5% vs 46.5% at 18 months; P=.023).

Query 1: What treatments are safe and effective for mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy?
Document 1: Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve outcome. To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005), LILACS (1984 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005). All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days. Two review authors independently extracted data. Forty-six trials (4282 women) were included. Twenty-eight trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3200 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (19 trials, 2409 women; relative risk (RR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.61; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.12 to -0.07); number needed to treat (NNT) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (22 trials, 2702 women; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.13). Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (26 trials, 3081 women; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08), preterm birth (14 trials, 1992 women; RR 1.02; 95 % CI 0.89 to 1.16), or small-for-gestational-age babies (19 trials, 2437 women; RR 1.04; 95 % CI 0.84 to 1.27). There were no clear differences in any other outcomes. Nineteen trials (1282 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another. Beta blockers seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (10 trials, 539 women, RR 0.75 (95 % CI 0.59 to 0.94); RD -0.08 (-0.14 to 0.02); NNT 12 (6 to 275)). There is no clear difference between any of the alternative drugs in the risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia. Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences. It remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.
Summary 1: In comparing one agent with another, methyldopa was the most commonly tested agent, with 14 randomized controlled trials of more than 1010 subjects demonstrating its efficacy at reducing blood pressure. Other antihypertensive agents appear better than methyldopa in terms of reducing the risk of infant mortality (RR=0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-0.99).

Query 2: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document 2: To quantify the effect of first-line antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates, compared with the other main classes of antihypertensive agents. We identified eligible trials by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, reference lists of previous reviews, and contacting researchers. We extracted data independently in duplicate and conducted meta-analysis by analysing trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of subsequent treatment actually received. Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo (four trials; n = 23,613), diuretics (five trials; n = 18,241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (four trials; n = 44,825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (three trials; n = 10,828). Compared to placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (0.88, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (0.93, 0.81-1.07) or cardiovascular mortality (0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of CCBs (1.24, 1.11-1.40) and RAS inhibitors (1.30, 1.11-1.53), and that on total cardiovascular events less than that of CCBs (1.18, 1.08-1.29). In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment than those on diuretics (1.80; 1.33-2.42) or RAS inhibitors (1.41; 1.29-1.54). Beta-blockers are inferior to CCBs and to RAS inhibitors for reducing several important hard end points. Compared with diuretics, they had similar outcomes, but were less well tolerated. Hence beta-blockers are generally suboptimal first-line antihypertensive drugs.
Summary 2: A recent systematic review found beta blockers to be inferior to calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) for major endpoints of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. This review found beta-blockers had similar outcomes as diuretics but were less well tolerated than diuretics (RR=1.80; 95% CI, 1.33-2.42) or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.41; 1.29-1.54). Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers with placebo (4 trials; n=23,613), diuretics (5 trials; n=18,241), calcium-channel blockers (4 trials; n=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (3 trials; n=10,828). Compared with placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (RR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (RR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (RR=0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (RR=0.93, 0.81-1.07), or cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.24, 1.11-1.40) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.30, 1.11-1.53). The effect on total cardiovascular events was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.18, 1.08-1.29).

Query: What treatments are safe and effective for mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy?
Document: Examine the benefits/risks of beta-blockers for pregnancy hypertension. Meta-analysis of relevant trials identified by comprehensive literature review (1966-97). Included were 30 trials for pregnancy hypertension, and four others for perinatal outcomes only. For mild chronic hypertension treated throughout pregnancy (n=2 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with an inconsistent increase in small for gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 2.46 [1.02, 5.92]). For mild-moderate 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (i.e. either chronic treated only late in pregnancy, or pregnancy-induced) (n=8 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with a decrease in severe hypertension (OR 0.27 [0.16, 0.451), borderline decrease in development of proteinuria (OR 0.69 [0.48, 1.02]), decrease in RDS (OR 0.33 [0.13, 0.85]), but a borderline increase in SGA infants (OR 1.47 [0.96, 2.26]). Beta-blockers were equivalent to other agents (n=15 trials). For severe 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (n=5 trials), i.v. labetalol produced less maternal hypotension (OR 0.13 [0.03, 0.71]) and fewer cesareans (OR 0.23 [0.13, 0.63]) than i.v. hydralazine/diazoxide. It is not clear that the benefits outweigh the risks when beta-blockers are used to treat mild to moderate chronic or pregnancy-induced hypertension, given the unknown overall effect on perinatal outcomes. For severe 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension, i.v. labetalol is safer than i.v. hydralazine or diazoxide.
Summary:","Meta-analyses of beta-blocker trials show a borderline increase in SGA infants, with no related increase in perinatal mortality, as well as a decrease in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome."

Query 1: How does venous thromboembolism risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives?
Document 1: This open-label, randomized, Phase III study compared the efficacy and tolerability of and compliance with NuvaRing, a combined contraceptive vaginal ring releasing 15 microg of ethinylestradiol (EE) and 120 microg of etonogestrel daily, with those of and with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 150 microg of levonorgestrel (LNG) and 30 microg of EE. Subjects received NuvaRing or a COC for 13 cycles (3 weeks of ring/pill treatment followed by a 1-week ring-/pill-free period). A total of 1030 subjects (NuvaRing, n=512; COC, n=518) was randomized and started treatment (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). The percentage of women in the ITT population who completed the trial was 70.9% for the NuvaRing group and 71.2% for the COC group. Five in-treatment pregnancies occurred in each group, giving Pearl indices of 1.23 for NuvaRing and 1.19 for the COC. Compliance with both treatments was excellent and both were well tolerated. In conclusion, NuvaRing has comparable efficacy and tolerability with a COC containing 150 microg of LNG and 30 microg of EE and does not require daily dosing.
Summary 1: A 1-year, open-label, randomized Phase III study of 1030 women compared the NuvaRing with a combination oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel and 30 µg EE. One case of deep venous thrombosis occurred in the NuvaRing group. In reviewing the data, the authors concluded that the NuvaRing demonstrated comparable safety and tolerability to the OC.

Query 2: How does venous thromboembolism risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives?
Document 2: There is concern that a new transdermal contraceptive patch containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) and the progestin norelgestromin increases the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to previously marketed oral contraceptives (OCs). Quantitative information was obtained on the risk of nonfatal VTE in women using the contraceptive patch in comparison to women using OCs, norgestimate (either monophasic or triphasic) and 35 microg EE (norgestimate-35), an OC that has been marketed for over a decade. Nested case-control design based on information from PharMetrics, a US-based company that collects and organizes information on claims paid by managed care plans. The study was nested among all women aged 15 to 44, who started either the contraceptive patch or norgestimate-35 after April 1, 2002. Cases were women with current use of one of these two study drugs and a documented diagnosis of VTE in the absence of identifiable clinical risk factors (idiopathic VTE). Up to four controls were matched to each case by age and calendar time. Odds ratios (ORs) comparing the risk of nonfatal VTE in new users of the two contraceptives and incidence rates of nonfatal VTE for new users of each of the study contraceptives. We identified 68 newly diagnosed, idiopathic cases of VTE in the study population. In the case-control analysis, the OR comparing the contraceptive patch to norgestimate-35 was 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.6). The overall incidence rate for VTE was 52.8 per 100,000 women-years (95% CI 35.8-74.9) among users of the contraceptive patch and 41.8 per 100,000 women-years among users of norgestimate-35 (95% CI 29.4-57.6), and the age-adjusted VTE incidence rate ratio (IRR) for current use of the contraceptive patch vs. norgestimate-35 was 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.8). The risk of nonfatal VTE for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for OCs containing 35 microg ethinylestradiol and norgestimate.
Summary 2: The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism in this study was 52.8 per 100,000 women-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8-74.9) among patch users and 41.8 per 100,000 women-years among oral contraceptive users (95% CI, 29.4-57.6). The study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the patch is not higher than the risk for an oral contraceptive containing 35 µg EE and norgestimate (odds ratio [OR]=0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.6; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.8).

Query: How does VTE risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives?
Document: This open-label, randomized study compared the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol (EE) from the contraceptive vaginal ring NuvaRing (15 microg EE/day), the transdermal patch (20 microg EE/day) and a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 30 microg EE. After 2-8 weeks of synchronization by COC treatment, subjects were randomized to 21 days of treatment with NuvaRing, patch or COC. Analysis of area under the EE concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) during 21 days of treatment showed that exposure to EE in the NuvaRing group was 3.4 times lower than in the patch group (p < .05) and 2.1 times lower than in the pill group (p < .05). Serum EE levels of subjects showed much lower variation with NuvaRing than with the patch or the COC. Thus, exposure to EE was significantly lower with NuvaRing than with the patch and pill methods, demonstrating that NuvaRing is a low-estrogen-dose contraceptive method that also results in low estrogen exposure.
Summary:",One pharmacokinetic study found that exposure to EE differed among delivery systems. The area under the EE concentration-vs-time curve in the patch group was 1.6 times higher than in the OC group (P<.05) and 3.4 times higher than in the vaginal ring group (P<.05).

Query 1: Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone?
Document 1: Osteoarthritis (OA) is often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). To assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of rofecoxib, celecoxib, and acetaminophen in adults with OA. Randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial, conducted from June 1999 to February 2000, in 29 clinical centers in the United States. Three hundred eighty-two patients aged at least 40 years who had OA of the knee that was previously treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Patients were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (n = 96); rofecoxib, 25 mg/d (n = 95); celecoxib, 200 mg/d (n = 97); or acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d (n = 94) for 6 weeks. Assessments over days 1 to 6 and over 6 weeks included pain on walking, night pain, pain at rest, and morning stiffness as measured on a Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]) and global response to therapy compared among 4 treatment groups. 79% of patients completed the study. More patients treated with acetaminophen discontinued early due to lack of efficacy than patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors (31% vs 18%-19%). Efficacy assessed in the first 6 days of therapy showed greatest response to rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, followed by rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, celecoxib, and acetaminophen, respectively, in terms of relief of pain on walking (-32.2, - 29.0, - 26.4, and -20.6 mm change on the VAS; P</=.04 for all others vs acetaminophen; P =.05 for 25-mg rofecoxib vs celecoxib), rest pain (-21.8, - 18.6, - 15.5, and - 12.5 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen and P =.02 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib), night pain (-25.2, - 22.0, - 18.7, and - 18.8 mm; P =.04 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs both acetaminophen and celecoxib), and morning stiffness (-30.4, - 28.4, - 25.7, and - 20.9 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen). Over 6 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided greatest response for night pain (P<.002 vs celecoxib and P =.006 vs acetaminophen and P =.02 vs rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d), composite pain subscale (P</=.03 vs all other treatments), stiffness subscale (P</=.04 vs celecoxib and acetaminophen), and physical function subscale (P =.001 vs acetaminophen). Global responses over 6 weeks showed a similar pattern (good or excellent response at week 6: 60%, 56%, 46%, and 39%, respectively; P</=.03 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib and acetaminophen; P =.02 for rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, vs acetaminophen). All treatments were generally safe and well tolerated. Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided efficacy advantages over acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d, celecoxib, 200 mg/d, and rofecoxib, 12.5 mg, for symptomatic knee OA.
Summary 1: One industry-sponsored randomized trial found rofecoxib superior to celecoxib, and both superior to acetaminophen in treatment of osteoarthritis pain. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects among the 3 medications. Thirty percent of patients taking 4 g/d acetaminophen discontinued the study because of lack of efficacy, compared with 20% of those taking either celecoxib or rofecoxib.

Query 2: Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone?
Document 2: To perform a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial of diclofenac + misoprostol versus acetaminophen in ambulatory patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Patients in 12 ambulatory care settings were eligible if they were age >40 years and if they had Kellgren/Lawrence radiographic grade 2-4 osteoarthritis of the knee or hip and a score of > or =30 mm on a 100-mm visual analog pain scale. Patients were randomized to one of two groups, 75 mg diclofenac + 200 microg misoprostol twice daily or 1,000 mg acetaminophen 4 times daily (each for 6 weeks), and were then crossed over to the other treatment for 6 weeks. A placebo was included in each treatment regimen to enable double blinding. The primary outcome measures were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the visual analog pain scale of the Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire. Safety was assessed using a standard form to review adverse events. We enrolled 227 patients, of whom 218 provided data for the first treatment period and 181 provided data for both treatment periods. Significantly higher levels of improvement in the primary outcomes were seen for diclofenac + misoprostol than for acetaminophen (P < 0.001). Adverse events were more common when patients took diclofenac + misoprostol (P = 0.046). Diclofenac + misoprostol was rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" by 57% of the 174 patients who provided such ratings for both treatment periods, while acetaminophen was rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" by 20% of these patients, and 22% reported no difference (P < 0.001). Differences favoring diclofenac + misoprostol over acetaminophen were greater in patients with more severe osteoarthritis according to baseline pain scores, radiographs, or number of involved joints. Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee had significantly greater improvements in pain scores over 6 weeks with diclofenac + misoprostol than with acetaminophen, although patients with mild osteoarthritis had similar improvements with both drugs. Acetaminophen was associated with fewer adverse events.
Summary 2: A 6-week randomized double-blind crossover trial of 227 patients comparing 75 mg diclofenac and 200 mg misoprostol (Arthrotec) with acetaminophen 4 g/d found the diclofenac-misoprostol combination provided more pain control than acetaminophen alone. Adverse events were slightly more common in the diclofenac group (54% vs 46%; P=.046).

Query: Do acetaminophen and an NSAID combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone?
Document: To compare the relative safety and efficacy of naproxen and acetaminophen in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The major outcome measures were radiographic progression and withdrawal from the trial due to lack of efficacy. One hundred seventy-eight patients with OA of the knee were enrolled in a 2-year prospective, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial and were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (ACT) or naproxen (NPX) treatment. After 6 weeks of treatment, modest improvement in pain on motion and in physician's global assessment was seen in both the ACT and the NPX groups, and the NPX group also had modest improvement in pain at rest and in 50-foot walk time. Sixty-two patients completed the 2-year study. Among these patients, radiographic progression was similar in the 2 treatment groups. Withdrawal from the trial due to lack of drug efficacy was slightly more frequent among patients in the ACT group (22% versus 16%), but withdrawal due to adverse drug effects was slightly more common in the NPX group (23% versus 18%). The efficacy of ACT treatment and NPX treatment was similar, although it was slightly better for NPX. The toxicity rate was slightly lower with ACT. However, the high rate of withdrawal in both treatment groups suggests that neither is satisfactory for the treatment of OA.
Summary:","One randomized controlled trial comparing 750 mg/d naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) with 2600 mg/d acetaminophen for 2 years found similar pain relief for both medications and a dropout rate of 65% in both groups. Similar numbers of persons taking acetaminophen or naproxen dropped out because of adverse effects (20%) or lack of efficacy (19%), and no difference was seen in functional improvement between the 2 groups."

Query 1: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document 1: The aim, in conservative management of vesico-ureteric reflux by antimicrobial prophylaxis, is to prevent recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and consequent renal scarring. However, the effects of this prophylactic strategy are difficult to evaluate, since the required studies comparing children on prophylaxis with controls (without prophylaxis but under careful supervision) are lacking. Furthermore, the optimal length of prophylaxis needs to be defined. Since risk of renal scarring is believed to occur more frequently in young people, and since recurrent urinary infections mainly affect girls, the age and sex of subjects are important in the design of a prophylactic regimen. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are the most common agents used for long-term, low-dose antibacterial prophylaxis. Break-through infections still result from non-compliance and from development of bacterial resistance, the latter mainly arising with trimethoprim. Few studies of prophylactic drugs are available that adequately define patient materials and include a random allocation to the different agents. Further studies of the effects of alternative prophylactic agents are called for, preferably combined with fresh insight into the ecological impact on the bowel and periurethral floras.
Summary 1: No randomized controlled trials assess whether prophylaxis prevents the development of new renal scars in children.

Query 2: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document 2: The recurrence rate for urinary tract infections in children is estimated at between 30% and 40%. The use of low doses of antibiotics as prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections is common clinical practice. However, prolonged antimicrobial therapy has the potential to contribute to problems of bacterial resistance and antimicrobial side effects. The aim of this review was to systematically examine the available evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention. We conducted a literature search of 3 electronic databases for the period 1966 to 1999. We also searched bibliographies from conference proceedings and contacted content experts to ensure completeness of our database. Each trial was evaluated on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: target population (children), intervention (antibiotic v. no antibiotic), outcome (number of urinary tract infections) and study design (randomized controlled trial). Quality was assessed for the studies that met these criteria. Most of the studies identified were case series and cohort studies. Only 6 randomized trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All were of low quality (median 2, range 0 to 2 [maximum quality score 5]). Three trials dealt with children who had anatomically normal urinary tracts, and three included children with neurogenic bladder. The rate of infections for patients with normal urinary tracts ranged from 0 to 4.0 per 10 patient-years for the treatment groups and from 4.0 to 16.7 for the control groups. The recurrence rates for patients with neurogenic bladders in 2 trials were 2.9 and 17.1 per 10 patient-years for the treatment groups and 1.5 and 33.0 for the control groups. The available evidence for using antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection in children with normal urinary tracts or neurogenic bladder is of low quality. This suggests that the magnitude of any benefit should at best be questioned. The surprising lack of data for children with reflux is of concern. Well-designed trials are needed to optimize the use of antimicrobials in children with recurrent urinary tract infection.
Summary 2: A recent systematic review of studies done in children with normal urinary tracts, as well in children with neurogenic bladders, found that the available evidence is of low quality. Only 6 out of 31 potential studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These were small (mean sample size was 28), and the quality scores of all 6 trials were low, indicating that the evidence may be unreliable. Two of 3 studies done in children with normal urinary tracts demonstrated statistically significant higher rates of urinary tract infection recurrence in control groups compared with treatment groups receiving 6 to 10 months of either nitrofurantoin or cotrimoxazole (RR=24-31). The third study showed no difference between groups. One of 2 trials in children with neurogenic bladder demonstrated higher recurrence rates of 2.9 per 10 patient years for patients receiving antibiotics compared with 1.5 in the untreated group. The other study showed lower recurrence rates of 17.1 for patients receiving antibiotics, compared with 33 in the untreated group. Neither of these findings were statistically significant.

Query 1: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document 1: Screening children for asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis and renal scarring is widely recommended, but its cost-effectiveness has not been established. We reviewed published studies to determine the costs and benefits of screening toilet-trained, asymptomatic children for bacteriuria. Given the sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods (approximately 80% each) and the prevalence of bacteriuria in asymptomatic children (approximately 1% in girls and 0.03% in boys), screening 100,000 children would result in 19,897 (20%) false-positive tests; initial screening and two urine cultures to confirm the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria would miss 28% of 515 children with true bacteriuria, and cost nearly $2.9 million. There is no evidence that detection and treatment of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria prevents subsequent pyelonephritis or renal scarring. Screening for bacteriuria in asymptomatic children is costly, fails to prevent pyelonephritis or renal scarring, and should be discontinued as a part of routine well-child care.
Summary 1: Expert opinion varies as to the necessity of screening urinalysis. No prospective randomized trials demonstrate improved outcomes, and limited evidence suggests that detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria improves long-term outcomes such as renal scarring, hypertension, or pyelone phritis.

Query 2: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document 2: To study awareness of urinary tract infections (UTIs) by determining the diagnostic rate of first UTI in children <2 years of age and to estimate the minimum incidence. Twenty-six of a total of 43 pediatric centers participated in the study. Sixty-four percent of the total childhood population <2 years of age was covered. The number of all children included in the study was used to calculate the diagnostic rate. Only UTI confirmed by either suprapubic aspiration (any growth) or midstream or bag samples with >/=100 000 bacteria/mL, together with a positive nitrite reaction, was used to estimate the minimum incidence. The mean diagnostic rate was 1.5% for boys (range, 0.7%-3.0%) and 1.7% for girls (range, 0.7%-2.9%). The diagnostic rate was significantly higher in June than in December. The mean incidence was 1.0% for both boys and girls (range, 0.3%-3.0% and 0.4%-2.9%, respectively). The minimum cumulative incidence at 2 years of age was estimated to be 2.2% for boys and 2.1% for girls. This study suggests a high UTI awareness in Sweden as indicated by a higher diagnostic rate and, despite stricter diagnostic criteria, a higher incidence of UTI in children <2 years of age than previously reported. It is suggested that a high UTI awareness may reduce chronic renal failure because of pyelonephritic renal scarring.
Summary 2: The prevalence of urinary tract infection in childhood has been estimated to be roughly 1%.

Query: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent UTI in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document: Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend obtaining a voiding cystourethrogram and a renal ultrasonogram for young children after a first urinary tract infection; renal scanning with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid has also been endorsed by other authorities. We investigated whether imaging studies altered management or improved outcomes in young children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. In a prospective trial involving 309 children (1 to 24 months old), an ultrasonogram and an initial renal scan were obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, contrast voiding cystourethrography was performed one month later, and renal scanning was repeated six months later. The ultrasonographic results were normal in 88 percent of the children (272 of 309); the identified abnormalities did not modify management. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 61 percent of the children (190 of 309). Thirty-nine percent of the children who underwent cystourethrography (117 of 302) had vesicoureteral reflux; 96 percent of these children (112 of 117) had grade I, II, or III vesicoureteral reflux. Repeated scans were obtained for 89 percent of the children (275 of 309); renal scarring was noted in 9.5 percent of these children (26 of 275). An ultrasonogram performed at the time of acute illness is of limited value. A voiding cystourethrogram for the identification of reflux is useful only if antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective in reducing reinfections and renal scarring. Renal scans obtained at presentation identify children with acute pyelonephritis, and scans obtained six months later identify those with renal scarring. The routine performance of urinalysis, urine culture, or both during subsequent febrile illnesses in all children with a previous febrile urinary tract infection will probably obviate the need to obtain either early or late scans.
Summary:","There was a clinically, but not statistically, significant trend towards reduced risk of UTI during long-term antibiotic treatment (risk reduction [RR]=0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.10-1.00); however, no sustained benefit was seen once antibiotics were stopped (RR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). There were many problems with the methodological quality of these trials, including significant heterogeneity. The researchers concluded that well-designed randomized controlled trails are still needed to evaluate this commonly used intervention in the pediatric population."

Query 1: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document 1: A review of the use of live attenuated varicella vaccine in immunocompromised children, particularly those with underlying leukemia in remission, is presented. Data concerning safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of this vaccine in high-risk children are reviewed. The unique contributions toward our understanding of varicella vaccine, including spread of vaccine-type virus, incidence of zoster, and immune correlates provided by studies of immunocompromised patients are discussed. The importance of protecting high-risk children against severe varicella by the use of varicella vaccine is apparent.
Summary 1: Some evidence suggests the incidence of herpes zoster is reduced in immunocompromised vaccine recipients, but long-term observation is needed to assess the effect on healthy recipients.
##
Query 2: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document 2: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of the live attenuated Oka/Merck varicella vaccine among 956 children between the ages of 1 and 14 years, with a negative clinical history of varicella. Of the 914 children who were serologically confirmed to be susceptible to varicella, 468 received vaccine and 446 received placebo. The vaccine produced few clinical reactions and was well tolerated. There was no clinical evidence of viral spread from vaccinated children to sibling controls. Approximately eight weeks after vaccination, 94 per cent of the initially seronegative children who received vaccine had detectable antibody to varicella. During the nine-month surveillance period, 39 clinically diagnosed cases of varicella, 38 of which were confirmed by laboratory tests, occurred among study participants. All 39 cases occurred in placebo recipients; no child who received vaccine contracted varicella. The vaccine was 100 per cent efficacious in preventing varicella in this population of healthy children (P less than 10(-9).
Summary 2: In children aged 10 months to 14 years, 1 randomized controlled trial found protective efficacy of 100% over 9 months and 98% over 7 years.

Query: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document: The efficacy of a high-titer, reformulated varicella vaccine was studied in 513 10- to 30-month-old children. Vaccinees were randomly allocated to 5 groups to receive one of two lots of an original high-titer vaccine, one of two lots of a partially heat-inactivated vaccine, or placebo. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Seroconversion was detected in 100% and 99% of children immunized with the high- and low-titer vaccines, respectively. Sixty-five cases of serologically confirmed varicella-like disease were discovered during follow-up (mean, 29.3 months): 5 in the high-titer vaccine group, 19 in the low-titer vaccine group, and 41 in the placebo group (P < or = .005 for each difference). Thus, the protective efficacy of live attenuated varicella vaccine is dependent on vaccine titer. High-titer varicella vaccine induces excellent protection in healthy young children.
Summary:",A trial showed efficacy of 72% over 29 months.

Document 2: In February 1999, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded recommendations for varicella (chickenpox) vaccine to promote wider use of the vaccine for susceptible children and adults. The updated recommendations include establishing child care and school entry requirements, use of the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine for some children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vaccination of adults and adolescents at high risk for exposure. These recommendations also provide new information on varicella vaccine postlicensure safety data.
Summary 2: Varicella is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in children.

Query 1: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document 1: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of the live attenuated Oka/Merck varicella vaccine among 956 children between the ages of 1 and 14 years, with a negative clinical history of varicella. Of the 914 children who were serologically confirmed to be susceptible to varicella, 468 received vaccine and 446 received placebo. The vaccine produced few clinical reactions and was well tolerated. There was no clinical evidence of viral spread from vaccinated children to sibling controls. Approximately eight weeks after vaccination, 94 per cent of the initially seronegative children who received vaccine had detectable antibody to varicella. During the nine-month surveillance period, 39 clinically diagnosed cases of varicella, 38 of which were confirmed by laboratory tests, occurred among study participants. All 39 cases occurred in placebo recipients; no child who received vaccine contracted varicella. The vaccine was 100 per cent efficacious in preventing varicella in this population of healthy children (P less than 10(-9).
Summary 1: In children aged 10 months to 14 years, 1 randomized controlled trial found protective efficacy of 100% over 9 months and 98% over 7 years.

Query 2: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document 2: A review of the use of live attenuated varicella vaccine in immunocompromised children, particularly those with underlying leukemia in remission, is presented. Data concerning safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of this vaccine in high-risk children are reviewed. The unique contributions toward our understanding of varicella vaccine, including spread of vaccine-type virus, incidence of zoster, and immune correlates provided by studies of immunocompromised patients are discussed. The importance of protecting high-risk children against severe varicella by the use of varicella vaccine is apparent.
Summary 2: Some evidence suggests the incidence of herpes zoster is reduced in immunocompromised vaccine recipients, but long-term observation is needed to assess the effect on healthy recipients.

Query: Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox?
Document: To determine the safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Children (n = 41) who were mildly affected by HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage N1 or A1) and had no history or serum antibody indicative of prior varicella infection were immunized with two doses of live attenuated varicella vaccine. A minority of the vaccine recipients had mild local or systemic reactions. Vaccination had no effect on the clinical stage of HIV or the HIV RNA plasma load. CD4 cell percentage and CD4 cell count were marginally decreased at week 4 after the first vaccination; this effect was no longer present at week 8 after vaccination. Two months after the second dose of vaccine, 60% of vaccine recipients had anti-varicella antibody in their serum, and 83% had a positive lymphocyte proliferation assay response to varicella antigen. On the basis of its safety and immunogenicity, varicella vaccine should be considered in the childhood vaccines given to mildly affected HIV-infected children.
Summary:",Study of vaccine use in other immunocompromised children has been limited. Early results from a trial in HIV-infected children who were not severely immunocompromised suggests similar tolerance and efficacy compared with children without HIV.

Query 1: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 1: Tiotropium, a once-daily anticholinergic, and salmeterol represent two inhaled, long-acting bronchodilators from different pharmacologic classes. A trial was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of both compounds with multiple outcome measures, including lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with COPD. A 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study of tiotropium, 18 microg once daily via dry-powder inhaler, compared with salmeterol, 50 microg bid via metered-dose inhaler, was conducted in patients with COPD. Efficacy was assessed by 12-h monitoring of spirometry, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). A total of 623 patients participated (tiotropium, n= 209; salmeterol, n = 213; and placebo, n = 201). The groups were similar in age (mean, 65 years), gender (75% men), and baseline FEV(1) (mean, 1.08 +/- 0.37 L; percent predicted, 40 +/- 12% [+/- SD]). Compared with placebo treatment, the mean predose morning FEV(1) following 6 months of therapy increased significantly more for the tiotropium group (0.14 L) than the salmeterol group (0.09 L; p < 0.01). The average FEV(1) (0 to 12 h) for tiotropium was statistically superior to salmeterol (difference, 0.08 L; p < 0.001). Tiotropium improved TDI focal score by 1.02 U compared with placebo (p = 0.01), whereas there was no significant change in TDI focal score with salmeterol (0.24 U). Tiotropium was superior to salmeterol in improving TDI focal score (p < 0.05). At 6 months, the mean improvement in SGRQ total score vs baseline was tiotropium, - 5.14 U (p < 0.05 vs placebo); salmeterol, - 3.54 U (p = 0.4 vs placebo); and placebo, - 2.43 U. A statistically higher proportion of patients receiving tiotropium achieved at least a 4-U change in SGRQ score compared to patients receiving placebo. Both active drugs reduced the need for rescue albuterol (p < 0.0001). Tiotropium once daily produces superior bronchodilation, improvements in dyspnea, and proportion of patients achieving meaningful changes in HRQoL compared to twice-daily salmeterol in patients with COPD.
Summary 1: A 6-month, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of salmeterol 50 µg twice daily vs tiotropium (a new long-acting inhaled anticholinergic) 18 µg once daily was published in 2002. Endpoints in 623 patients were assessed using 12-hour spirometric performance, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). (SGRQ is a validated disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being. It measures activity limitations, symptoms, and psychosocial impact.) Tiotropium showed superiority over salmeterol in all endpoints assessed (0.14 L increase in morning FEV1vs 0.09 L, 1.02 U improvement in TDI score vs 0.24, and -5.14 U improvement of SGRQ total score from baseline vs -3.54). However, it should be noted that a difference of 1 on the TDI score was necessary to suggest a clinical benefit. While the overall difference in SGQR between tiotropium and salmeterol did not reach statistical significance, the proportion of patients in the tiotropium group that reached the clinically significant threshold of 4 units improvement in SGRQ score was significantly higher than in the salmeterol group (51% vs 40%; P<.05).

Query 2: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document 2: The efficacy and safety of salmeterol alone was compared with the combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium and with placebo during long-term treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, the single-dose effect in response to the first dose of treatment was studied over 12 h. The patients (n=144; age 64+/-7 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 44+/-11% pred) participated in a three-centre double-blind double-placebo parallel group study and were randomized after a run-in period of 2 weeks to receive either salmeterol 50 microg b.i.d., salmeterol 5 microg b.i.d. plus ipratropium 40 microg q.i.d. or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The single-dose study demonstrated that salmeterol produced a significant increase in FEV1 (peak of 7% pred) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) (maximum of 60% baseline) for > or =12 h. The combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium elicited a greater bronchodilator response (11% and 94% increases respectively) than salmeterol alone during the first 6 h after inhalation. During treatment there were significant improvements in daytime symptom scores and morning peak expiratory flow in both the salmeterol and the salmeterol plus ipratropium groups (p<0.001), with an associated decrease in the use of rescue salbutamol. Improvements in FEV1 and sGaw were greater in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group than in the patients receiving only salmeterol. Thirty-five patients had an exacerbation; 11 (23%) in the salmeterol group (versus placebo NS), six (13%) in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group (versus placebo p<0.01) and 18 (36%) in the placebo group. In conclusion, in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term treatment with either salmeterol alone or salmeterol plus ipratropium is safe and effective. There was added benefit from the combination therapy in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol.
Summary 2: A 12-week double-blind, double-placebo-controlled parallel group study published in 2000 followed 144 patients (age 64 ± 7 years with a FEV1of 44 ±11% predicted) randomized to receive salmeterol 50 µg twice daily alone, salmeterol 50 µg twice daily plus ipratropium 40 µg 4 times daily, or placebo. Patients were assessed for changes in FEV1, daytime symptom scores, specific airway conductance, and the need for rescue medication. The study demonstrated a significant benefit from the addition of ipratropium to salmeterol in terms of reduction of airway obstruction, but not in symptom control or need for rescue medication. However, no patients were randomized to receive ipratropium alone, so comparison of the relative contribution of the 2 classes is limited.

Query: Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD?
Document: A study was undertaken to record exacerbations and health resource use in patients with COPD during 6 months of treatment with tiotropium, salmeterol, or matching placebos. Patients with COPD were enrolled in two 6-month randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, double dummy studies of tiotropium 18 micro g once daily via HandiHaler or salmeterol 50 micro g twice daily via a metered dose inhaler. The two trials were combined for analysis of heath outcomes consisting of exacerbations, health resource use, dyspnoea (assessed by the transitional dyspnoea index, TDI), health related quality of life (assessed by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), and spirometry. 1207 patients participated in the study (tiotropium 402, salmeterol 405, placebo 400). Compared with placebo, tiotropium but not salmeterol was associated with a significant delay in the time to onset of the first exacerbation. Fewer COPD exacerbations/patient year occurred in the tiotropium group (1.07) than in the placebo group (1.49, p<0.05); the salmeterol group (1.23 events/year) did not differ from placebo. The tiotropium group had 0.10 hospital admissions per patient year for COPD exacerbations compared with 0.17 for salmeterol and 0.15 for placebo (not statistically different). For all causes (respiratory and non-respiratory) tiotropium, but not salmeterol, was associated with fewer hospital admissions while both groups had fewer days in hospital than the placebo group. The number of days during which patients were unable to perform their usual daily activities was lowest in the tiotropium group (tiotropium 8.3 (0.8), salmeterol 11.1 (0.8), placebo 10.9 (0.8), p<0.05). SGRQ total score improved by 4.2 (0.7), 2.8 (0.7) and 1.5 (0.7) units during the 6 month trial for the tiotropium, salmeterol and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.01 tiotropium v placebo). Compared with placebo, TDI focal score improved in both the tiotropium group (1.1 (0.3) units, p<0.001) and the salmeterol group (0.7 (0.3) units, p<0.05). Evaluation of morning pre-dose FEV(1), peak FEV(1) and mean FEV(1) (0-3 hours) showed that tiotropium was superior to salmeterol while both active drugs were more effective than placebo. Exacerbations of COPD and health resource usage were positively affected by daily treatment with tiotropium. With the exception of the number of hospital days associated with all causes, salmeterol twice daily resulted in no significant changes compared with placebo. Tiotropium also improved health related quality of life, dyspnoea, and lung function in patients with COPD.
Summary:","In a study in 2003, 1207 patients were randomized to receive the above doses of salmeterol, tiotropium, or placebo. Over the course of 6 months, tiotropium was associated with a significant delay in onset of the first exacerbation compared with placebo, and overall it led to the fewest exacerbations per patient-year. Fewer hospital admissions were also demonstrated in the tiotropium group per patient-year, and the number of days that patients were unable to perform usual activities was lowest for the tiotropium group. Again, improvement in TDI and SGRQ scores was significantly greater with tiotropium than placebo. In almost all outcomes, the salmeterol results were intermediate between those of tiotropium and placebo, and were not statistically different from placebo."

Query 1: What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones?
Document 1: Our aim was to compare unenhanced helical CT and excretory urography in the assessment of patients with renal colic. Fifty-three of 70 consecutive patients with acute signs of renal colic were prospectively examined with unenhanced helical CT, which was followed immediately by excretory urography. Two radiologists who were unaware of the findings independently interpreted these examinations to determine the presence or absence of ureteral obstruction. On all CT scans that had positive findings for ureteral stones or obstruction, we looked for secondary signs of obstruction (perinephric or periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, ureteral dilatation, and blurring of renal sinus fat). A stone was recovered in 45 of the 53 patients, nine before and 36 after imaging. The latter 36 patients had their stones identified on CT, whereas only 24 patients had their stones identified on excretory urography. Eight patients without stone disease had normal ureters on both CT and excretory urography. Of the 45 patients who had stone disease, 26 had ureteral dilatation on both CT and excretory urography, and 36 patients who recovered a stone after CT had secondary signs of obstruction. Of the nine patients who recovered a stone before CT, three had secondary signs of obstruction. Two patients had periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, and renal sinus fat blurring. One patient had only ureteral wall edema. Compared with excretory urography, unenhanced helical CT is better for identifying ureteral stones in patients with acute ureterolithiasis. Secondary CT signs of obstruction, including renal sinus fat blurring, were frequently present even when the stone was eliminated before imaging.
Summary 1: The Belgian study enrolled 53 of 70 consecutive patients. This study compared helical computerized tomography with intravenous pyelography (IVP) and used the gold standard of recovery and direct visualization of a stone. In this study, helical computerized tomography correctly identified every instance of urinary tract stones. In contrast, excretory urography failed to detect stones in a third of the patients with stones, and 44% of the negative readings were false-negatives. Both tests did well in reporting negative results for those patients without stones (specificity = 97% for both tests). In terms of likelihood ratios, helical computerized tomography and excretory urography had positive likelihood ratios of 29 and 19, respectively, and negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.36 (a lower negative likelihood ratio is better). In other words, helical computerized tomography appears to be far superior to excretory urography in ruling out the presence of urinary tract stones.

Query 2: What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones?
Document 2: Hematuria testing is routinely performed in patients with acute flank pain to screen for ureterolithiasis and to help determine the need for excretory urography. Unenhanced helical computerized tomography (CT) has recently been shown to be superior to excretory urography in diagnosing ureteral obstruction and can evaluate many other causes of flank pain. Given the speed, accuracy and safety of CT the value of hematuria testing for acute flank pain should be reexamined. We reviewed the medical records of 267 consecutive patients with acute flank pain referred for unenhanced helical CT. Microscopic and dipstick urinalysis data were obtained in 195 patients. Using helical CT as the gold standard, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy of hematuria for diagnosing ureterolithiasis. Of the patients with ureterolithiasis 33% had 5 or less, 19% had 1 or less and 11% had no red blood cells (RBCs) per high power field. Of the patients without ureterolithiasis 24% had greater than 5 and 51% had greater than 1 RBC per high power field. Of the patients with ureterolithiasis 14% had a negative dipstick test and 1 RBC or less per high power field. There were 25 patients without ureterolithiasis who had CT abnormalities unrelated to the urinary tract, of whom 8 had greater than 1 RBC per high power field. Absence of hematuria in the setting of acute flank pain cannot exclude a diagnosis of ureterolithiasis and should not obviate other diagnostic testing. Even when strongly positive on microscopy, hematuria has insufficient positive predictive value for diagnosing ureterolithiasis and may be misleading as other serious conditions resulting in acute flank pain may yield a positive test.
Summary 2: A study found that urine dipstick testing for hematuria yielded positive likelihood ratios of 1.25 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.55.

Query: What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones?
Document: We compare noncontrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) and excretory urography (IVP) in the evaluation of acute flank pain. A total of 40 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with acute flank pain were evaluated with noncontrast CT, films of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, and IVP. The patients were treated according to the clinical picture. All 40 sets of evaluations were later assessed randomly by an independent consultant radiologist for the presence, size and location of a stone, ureteral dilatation and secondary signs of ureteral obstruction. Of 40 patients 12 had no calculus and 28 had a calculus confirmed on removal or documented passage of a stone. Absence of a stone was based on clinical and radiological followup with clinical resolution. CT revealed all 28 calculi and no calculus in 11 of 12 patients with 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity. IVP demonstrated 18 calculi (64% sensitivity) and no calculus in 11 of 12 patients (92% specificity). Ureteral obstruction was seen in 28 of the 40 patients, and CT and IVP were equivalent in detection (100% sensitivity). Films of the kidneys, ureters and bladder alone demonstrated 15 of 28 stones (54% sensitivity). Noncontrast CT is an accurate, safe, rapid technique to assess acute flank pain, and the evaluation of choice for patients who would otherwise require IVP for diagnosis.
Summary:","The Australian study enrolled 40 consecutive patients. This study compared helical CT with intravenous pyelography (IVP) and used the gold standard of recovery and direct visualization of a stone.

Query 1: How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis?
Document 1: Patients with diverticular disease are frequently advised to avoid eating nuts, corn, popcorn, and seeds to reduce the risk of complications. However, there is little evidence to support this recommendation. To determine whether nut, corn, or popcorn consumption is associated with diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study is a cohort of US men followed up prospectively from 1986 to 2004 via self-administered questionnaires about medical (biennial) and dietary (every 4 years) information. Men reporting newly diagnosed diverticulosis or diverticulitis were mailed supplemental questionnaires. The study included 47,228 men aged 40 to 75 years who at baseline were free of diverticulosis or its complications, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease and returned a food-frequency questionnaire. Incident diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. During 18 years of follow-up, there were 801 incident cases of diverticulitis and 383 incident cases of diverticular bleeding. We found inverse associations between nut and popcorn consumption and the risk of diverticulitis. The multivariate hazard ratios for men with the highest intake of each food (at least twice per week) compared with men with the lowest intake (less than once per month) were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.01; P for trend = .04) for nuts and 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.92; P for trend = .007) for popcorn. No associations were seen between corn consumption and diverticulitis or between nut, corn, or popcorn consumption and diverticular bleeding or uncomplicated diverticulosis. In this large, prospective study of men without known diverticular disease, nut, corn, and popcorn consumption did not increase the risk of diverticulosis or diverticular complications. The recommendation to avoid these foods to prevent diverticular complications should be reconsidered.
Summary 1: A trial conducted as part of a large prospective cohort study-the Health Professionals Follow-up Study-followed 47,228 male health professionals in the United States, ages 40 to 75 years, from 1986 to 2004. The subjects, all of whom returned a food-frequency questionnaire, were at baseline free of diverticulosis and related complications, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. During the follow-up period, 801 cases of diverticulitis and 383 cases of diverticular bleeding (the main outcome measures) occurred. The investigators found an inverse association between consumption of nuts and popcorn and risk of diverticulitis. Men with the highest intake of each food (at least twice per week) compared with men with the lowest intake (less than once per month) had a hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.01; P for trend=.04) for nuts and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92; P for trend=.007) for popcorn. No association was noted between corn consumption and diverticulitis or between nut, corn, or popcorn consumption and diverticular bleeding or uncomplicated diverticulosis.

Query 2: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document 2: To review recent evidence on dietary factors associated with diverticular disease (DD) with special emphasis on dietary fibre. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles on the relationship between dietary and other lifestyle factors and DD. Most articles either focused on dietary intervention in treating symptomatic DD or were case-control studies with inherent limitations for studying diet-disease associations. Only one large prospective study of male health professionals in the United States assessed diet at baseline and before initial diagnosis of DD. A diet high in fibre mainly from fruits and vegetables and low in total fat and red meat decreases risk of DD. Evidence indicates that the insoluble component of fibre is strongly associated with lower risk of DD; this association was particularly strong for cellulose. Caffeine and alcohol do not substantially increase risk of DD, nor does obesity, but higher levels of physical activity seem to reduce risk of DD. A diet high in fibre and low in total fat and red meat and a lifestyle with more physical activity might help prevent DD.
Summary 2: Because of strong epidemiological evidence that people from cultures with high-fiber diets are far less likely to develop diverticulosis than are people who live in cultures of low-fiber diets, it has been assumed that a diet high in fiber can prevent diverticulosis. Many small, uncontrolled studies have also investigated the effect of high-fiber diets and supplements on symptoms of diverticulosis and prevention of diverticulitis episodes.

Query: How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis?
Document: A diet high in fiber (particularly fruit and vegetable fiber) and low in fat and red meat may help to decrease the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, case-control studies and a large prospective cohort study). For people with diverticular disease, a diet high in fiber might decrease the risk of complications (SOR: C, case series). No studies have evaluated the effect of nut and seed avoidance.
Summary:",A 2006 Family Physicians Inquiries Network Clinical Inquiry on diverticulosis found inconsistent evidence that fiber decreases the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease.

Query 1: How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis?
Document 1: Diverticula (mucosal outpouching through the wall of the colon) affect over 5% of adults aged 40 years and older, but only 10-25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: treatments for uncomplicated diverticular disease; treatments to prevent complications; and treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodics, bran, elective surgery, increasing fibre intake, ispaghula husk, lactulose, medical treatment, mesalazine, methylcellulose, rifaximin, surgery.
Summary 1: A 2007 systematic review found 1 randomized controlled trials of the anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine (mesalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid) for preventing diverticulitis. Mesalamine reduced the recurrence rate of diverticulitis from 46% to 15% among 166 subjects. The reviewers judged the study to be flawed by unreported diagnostic criteria and a high withdrawal rate. They concluded that the effectiveness of mesalamine remains unknown.

Query 2: How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis?
Document 2: Diverticulitis is a common condition. Practice guidelines from many organizations recommend bowel resection after two attacks. The evidence for such a recommendation is reviewed. A Medline literature search was performed to locate English language articles on surgery for diverticular disease. Further articles were obtained from the references cited in the literature initially reviewed. Most people with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. Diverticular disease occurs in over 25 per cent of the population, increasing with age. After one episode of diverticulitis one-third of patients have recurrent symptoms; after a second episode a further third have a subsequent episode. Perforation is commonest during the first episode of acute diverticulitis. After recovering from an episode of diverticulitis the risk of an individual requiring an urgent Hartmann's procedure is one in 2000 patient-years of follow-up. Surgery for diverticular disease has a high complication rate and 25 per cent of patients have ongoing symptoms after bowel resection. There is no evidence to support the idea that elective surgery should follow two attacks of diverticulitis. Further prospective trials are required.
Summary 2: No randomized trials have compared surgical with medical therapy to prevent recurrent diverticulitis. Extensive retrospective literature fails to support elective surgery after a second episode. Sixty-eight percent to 96% of patients requiring surgery for diverticulitis-associated perforation or abscess had no previous symptoms and could not be helped by prophylactic surgery, and diverticulitis symptoms persisted after bowel resection in 27% to 33% of patients.

Query 1: What is the best therapy for constipation in infants?
Document 1: Hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions are commonly used for the treatment of acute constipation in the pediatric emergency department. The potential for severe metabolic derangement and death in children with gastrointestinal and/or renal abnormalities and these reported as normal has been documented in the literature. To develop guidelines for the safe and effective use of hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions such as Fleet enema, in the pediatric emergency department setting. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using the MEDLINE database for the time period 1966 to September 1995. Resources used within our institution, the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, included Staff of the Emergency and General Surgery Departments. The guidelines provided will promote safe use of hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions for the treatment of acute constipation in children presenting to the emergency department.
Summary 1: Sodium phosphate enemas in children under 2 years of age have been associated with electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, and cardiac arrest.

Query 2: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 2: To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG+E) for the treatment of chronic constipation in children. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial, with two 2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week placebo washout. Six UK paediatric departments. 51 children (29 girls, 22 boys) aged 24 months to 11 years with chronic constipation (lasting > or =3 months), defined as < or =2 complete bowel movements per week and one of the following: pain on defaecation on 25% of days; > or =25% of bowel movements with straining; > or =25% of bowel movements with hard/lumpy stools. 47 children completed the double blind treatment. Number of complete defaecations per week (primary efficacy variable), total number of complete and incomplete defaecations per week, pain on defaecation, straining on defaecation, faecal incontinence, stool consistency, global assessment of treatment, adverse events and physical examination. The mean number of complete defaecations per week was significantly higher for children on PEG+E than on placebo (3.12 (SD 2.05) v 1.45 (SD 1.20), respectively; p<0.001). Further significant differences in favour of PEG+E were observed for total number of defaecations per week (p = 0.003), pain on defaecation (p = 0.041), straining on defaecation (p<0.001), stool consistency (p<0.001) and percentage of hard stools (p = 0.001). Treatment related adverse events (all mild or moderate) occurred in similar numbers of children on PEG+E (41%) and placebo during treatment (45%). PEG+E is significantly more effective than placebo, and appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
Summary 2: A recent high-quality randomized controlled trials compared the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E) with placebo in 51 children with CFC, 2 to 11 years of age. The mean number of defecations per week was higher for children on polyethylene glycol + E (3.12 vs 1.45; P<.001); straining or pain and stool consistency improved.

Query: What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients?
Document: A ""quick"" prevalence study of intractable diarrhoea (defined as diarrhoea lasting more than 3 weeks and dependent on parenteral nutrition [PN] for more than 50% of daily caloric intake) was conducted by FAX. All 35 paediatric gastroenterology services which had been contacted answered questionnaire sent by FAX. 20 cases of intractable diarrhoea were identified in 9 centres. In 12 cases PN was administered at home, the other 8 cases being treated as inpatients for an average duration of 9.5 months. A diagnosis had been established in 11 out of 20 cases. Auto-immune enteropathy was the most frequent diagnosis (5 cases); congenital microvillous atrophy (3 cases); chronic pseudo-obstruction (2 cases) and multiple food intolerance (1 case). Undefined 9/20 cases presented atrophy of intestinal mucosa. The age of the beginning of diarrhoea varied from 2 days to 12 years, but was more than 16 months only in some cases with auto-immune enteropathy. CONCLUSION: Intractable diarrhoea has a low prevalence in Italy and remains a rare but very intricating problem. Long-term PN is recommended in most cases: autoimmune enteropathy is the most frequent cause but in about half of the cases the aetiopathogenetic diagnosis is still not defined.
Summary:","A small tertiary-care pediatric study defining chronic diarrhea as occurring for more than 3 weeks and dependent on parenteral nutrition for more than 50% of daily caloric intake included only 20 patients. The diagnoses included autoimmune enteropathy, congenital microvillous atrophy, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and multiple food intolerance."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate acute diarrhea?
Document 1: Few data have been published recently on the etiology of outpatient pediatric diarrhea in the US. We determined the etiology of acute, nondysenteric diarrhea among 147 children between 2 and 11 years old presenting to 9 outpatient clinics in various regions of the US between August, 1991, and August, 1993. Enteropathogens were sought by conventional laboratory methods. The various diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were sought. A recognized etiologic agent was detected in the stools of 89 (60.5%) children and 15 (10) patients had multiple agents detected. Rotavirus was found in 43 (29.3%) of the children, with a spring and winter peak in occurrence. Giardia lamblia was identified in 22 (15%) cases with a spring peak. HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli were found in 15 (10.2%). Other agents found included: enteric adenovirus in 7 (4.8%); Salmonella in 5 (3.4%); enterohemorrhagic E. coli in 5 (3.4%); enteropathogenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); enterotoxigenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); Entamoeba histolytica in 1 (0.70%); and Campylobacter jejuni in 1 (0.7%). In addition to the presence of conventional enteropathogens, diarrheagenic E. coli (HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli) were associated with endemic pediatric diarrhea in the US.
Summary 1: A prospective study of 147 US children with acute, mild diarrhea demonstrated that rectal swabs yielded a positive test for an infectious agent in 60.5% of cases.

Query 2: What is the best way to evaluate acute diarrhea?
Document 2: To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated. CONSENSUS: An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement. Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200-250 mOsm/l) given ""little and often"". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated. The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.
Summary 2: A systematic review found no published studies about the likelihood of specific diagnoses in children presenting to the hospital with diarrhea.

Query: What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients?
Document: The value of proximal intestinal mucosal biopsy was reviewed in 381 children presenting with chronic diarrhoea over an eight year period. An enteropathy was detected in 44% of cases and was more frequently seen in those aged less than 6 months. A diagnosis was established in 91% of cases. The most common diagnosis was the postenteritis syndrome where the presence of an enteropathy indicated those requiring treatment with a cows' milk free diet. Other conditions where a biopsy facilitated diagnosis or treatment included giardiasis, enteropathogenic Escheriichia coli, crytosporidiosis, autoimmune enteropathy, and microvillous atrophy. Coeliac disease was considered in 55% of children and established in 8%, clearly identifying those requiring a gluten free diet. This also emphasises the important role of the biopsy procedure in the exclusion of specific diseases. Proximal small intestinal mucosal biopsy is an essential investigation in children with chronic diarrhoea in whom an enteropathy is suspected.
Summary:","A pedriatic study included 381 children from a tertiary-care center with chronic diarrhea defined as lasting longer than 14 days. In this case series, 31% of children had toddler's diarrhea, defined as chronic diarrhea with no definitive cause in an otherwise healthy baby who is growing normally. Cow's milk sensitivity enteropathy comprised an additional 30% of cases. Etiologies for diarrhea in the remaining cases were infectious (11.8%), idiopathic (8.9%), celiac (7.3%), and other (10.2%)."

Query 1: Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients?
Document 1: Some epidemiological studies have suggested that high dietary intake of calcium and fibre reduces colorectal carcinogenesis. Available data are not sufficient to serve as a basis for firm dietary advice. We undertook a multicentre randomised trial to test the effect of diet supplementation with calcium and fibre on adenoma recurrence. We randomly assigned 665 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas to three treatment groups, in a parallel design: calcium gluconolactate and carbonate (2 g elemental calcium daily), fibre (3.5 g ispaghula husk), or placebo. Participants had colonoscopy after 3 years of follow-up. The primary endpoint was adenoma recurrence. Analyses were by intention to treat. 23 patients died, 15 were lost to follow-up, 45 refused repeat colonoscopy, and five developed severe contraindications to colonoscopy. Among the 552 participants who completed the follow-up examination, 94 stopped treatment early. At least one adenoma developed in 28 (15.9%) of 176 patients in the calcium group, 58 (29.3%) of 198 in the fibre group, and 36 (20.2%) of 178 in the placebo group. The adjusted odds ratio for recurrence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.38-1.17; p=0.16) for calcium treatment and 1.67 (1.01-2.76, p=0.042) for the fibre treatment. The odds ratio associated with the fibre treatment was significantly higher in participants with baseline dietary calcium intake above the median than in those with intake below the median (interaction test, p=0.028) Supplementation with fibre as ispaghula husk may have adverse effects on colorectal adenoma recurrence, especially in patients with high dietary calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with a modest but not significant reduction in the risk of adenoma recurrence.
Summary 1: In a trial of ispaghula husk fiber, the intervention group actually had significantly more recurrent adenomas after 3 years 29.3% vs 20.2%; RR=1.67; 95% CI, 1.01-2.76; P=.04.

Query 2: How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia?
Document 2: The effects of dietary soluble fibers on blood cholesterol are uncertain. This meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials was performed to quantify the cholesterol-lowering effect of major dietary fibers. Least-squares regression analyses were used to test the effect on blood lipids of pectin, oat bran, guar gum, and psyllium. Independent variables were type and amount of soluble fiber, initial cholesterol concentration, and other important study characteristics. Soluble fiber, 2-10 g/d, was associated with small but significant decreases in total cholesterol [-0.045 mmol L(-1).g soluble fiber(-1) (95% CI: -0.054, -0.035)] and LDL cholesterol [-0.057 mmol.L(-1).g(-1) (95% CI: -0.070, -0.044)]. The effects on plasma lipids of soluble fiber from oat, psyllium, or pectin were not significantly different. We were unable to compare effects of guar because of the limited number of studies using 2-10 g/d. Triacylglycerols and HDL cholesterol were not significantly influenced by soluble fiber. Lipid changes were independent of study design, treatment length, and background dietary fat content. Various soluble fibers reduce total and LDL cholesterol by similar amounts. The effect is small within the practical range of intake. For example, 3 g soluble fiber from oats (3 servings of oatmeal, 28 g each) can decrease total and LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.13 mmol/L. Increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution to dietary therapy to lower cholesterol.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 67 good-quality RCTs evaluated the effects of soluble dietary fiber in 2990 subjects (mean baseline lipid values [mg/dL]: total cholesterol, 240.9; LDL, 164.4). Diets high in soluble fiber (average dose of 9.5 g/d) were associated with a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein and no significant change in high density lipoprotein or triglycerides. Type of fiber (oat, psyllium, or pectin) was not influential after controlling for initial lipid level.

Query: What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol?
Document: To determine the effects of carbohydrate restriction (CR) with and without soluble fiber on lipoprotein metabolism, 29 men participated in a 12-wk weight loss intervention. Subjects were matched by age and BMI and randomly assigned to consume 3 g/d of either a soluble fiber supplement (n=14) or placebo (n=15) with a macronutrient energy distribution of approximately 10% carbohydrate, approximately 65% fat, and approximately 25% protein. Because the groups did not differ in any of the variables measured, all data were pooled and comparisons were made between baseline and 12 wk. After 12 wk, subjects had a mean weight loss of 7.5 kg (P<0.001), and abdominal fat was reduced by 20% (P<0.001). Plasma LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were significantly reduced by 8.9 and 38.6%, respectively. Similarly, apolipoproteins C-I (-13.8%), C-III (-21.2%) and E (-12.5%) were significantly lower after the intervention. In contrast plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations were increased by 12% (P<0.05). Changes in plasma TG were positively correlated with reductions in large (r=0.615, P<0.01) and medium VLDL particles (r=0.432, P<0.05) and negatively correlated with LDL diameter (r=-0.489, P<0.01). Changes in trunk fat were positively correlated with medium VLDL (r=0.474, P<0.0) and small LDL (r=0.405, P<0.05) and negatively correlated with large HDL (r=-0.556, P<0.01). We conclude that weight loss induced by CR favorably alters the secretion and processing of plasma lipoproteins, rendering VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles associated with decreased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
Summary:","A systematic review with meta-analysis of 23 RCTs evaluating effect of various amounts of soy protein with isoflavones on lipid profile found a 3% increase in HDL with an absolute difference 1.5 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.0-2.8)."

Query 1: When should we treat isolated high triglycerides?
Document 1: Coronary heart disease patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, high triglyceride levels, or both are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the clinical impact of raising HDL-C or decreasing triglycerides remains to be confirmed. In a double-blind trial, 3090 patients with a previous myocardial infarction or stable angina, total cholesterol of 180 to 250 mg/dL, HDL-C < or =45 mg/dL, triglycerides < or =300 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < or =180 mg/dL were randomized to receive either 400 mg of bezafibrate per day or a placebo; they were followed for a mean of 6.2 years. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or sudden death. Bezafibrate increased HDL-C by 18% and reduced triglycerides by 21%. The frequency of the primary end point was 13. 6% on bezafibrate versus 15.0% on placebo (P=0.26). After 6.2 years, the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point was 7.3%, (P=0.24). In a post hoc analysis in the subgroup with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL), the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point by bezafibrate was 39.5% (P=0.02). Total and noncardiac mortality rates were similar, and adverse events and cancer were equally distributed. Bezafibrate was safe and effective in elevating HDL-C levels and lowering triglycerides. An overall trend in a reduction of the incidence of primary end points was observed. The reduction in the primary end point in patients with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL) requires further confirmation.
Summary 1: In 3 large-scale prospective, placebo-controlled trials (the Helsinki Heart Study, a primary prevention study, and the VA-HIT and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trials, both secondary prevention studies), lowering triglycerides and raising high density lipoprotein concurrently improved outcomes. Successful dietary and medical interventions, especially with statins and fibrates, improved overall lipid profiles-not just triglyceride levels.

Query 2: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 2: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 2: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query: What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol?
Document: While vigorous exercise, alcohol, and weight loss are all known to increase high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), it is not known whether these interventions increase low HDL as effectively as has been demonstrated for normal HDL. This report tests the hypothesis that there may be differences in the calculated response of men and women with low versus high HDL-C to exercise, alcohol, and weight loss across the spectrum of HDL-C levels. Physican-supplied medical data from 7,288 men and 2,326 women were divided into deciles of self-reported vigorous exercise, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), or body circumferences. Within each decile we determined the percentiles of the HDL distributions and average running distance, alcohol intake, BMI, or body circumference. Simple least-squares regression analysis was then used to estimate the slope for kth HDL percentile (k = 5%, 6%, ...,95%) versus running distance, alcohol intake, BMI, or body circumference across deciles. Bootstrap resampling was used to estimate standard errors and statistical significance for the regression lines. In both sexes, the increase in HDL-C per unit alcohol intake was at least twice as great at the 95th as at the 5th percentile of the HDL distribution. There was also a significant graded increase from the 5th to the 95th HDL percentile for the slopes relating HDL to exercise (km run) and alcohol intake. Men's HDL-C declined in association with fatness (BMI, waist, and chest circumference) more sharply at the 95th than at the 5th percentile of the HDL distribution. The results of this study suggest that the effects of physical activity, alcohol, and weight reduction on HDL-C levels may be, to a large extent, dependent on the initial level with the greatest improvement achieved in subjects with high HDL and the least improvement in those having low HDL-C levels.
Summary:",An uncontrolled prospective trial showed a 12% increase in HDL.

Query 1: Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults?
Document 1: Obesity in the United States has increased dramatically during the past several decades. There is debate about optimum calorie balance for prevention of weight gain, and proponents of some low-carbohydrate diet regimens have suggested that the increasing obesity may be attributed, in part, to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. To report data on body weight in a long-term, low-fat diet trial for which the primary end points were breast and colorectal cancer and to examine the relationships between weight changes and changes in dietary components. Randomized intervention trial of 48,835 postmenopausal women in the United States who were of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities and participated in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial; 40% (19,541) were randomized to the intervention and 60% (29,294) to a control group. Study enrollment was between 1993 and 1998, and this analysis includes a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (through August 31, 2004). The intervention included group and individual sessions to promote a decrease in fat intake and increases in vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption and did not include weight loss or caloric restriction goals. The control group received diet-related education materials. Change in body weight from baseline to follow-up. Women in the intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg, P<.001) and maintained lower weight than control women during an average 7.5 years of follow-up (difference, 1.9 kg, P<.001 at 1 year and 0.4 kg, P = .01 at 7.5 years). No tendency toward weight gain was observed in intervention group women overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index. Weight loss was greatest among women in either group who decreased their percentage of energy from fat. A similar but lesser trend was observed with increases in vegetable and fruit servings, and a nonsignificant trend toward weight loss occurred with increasing intake of fiber. A low-fat eating pattern does not result in weight gain in postmenopausal women. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00000611.
Summary 1: The Women's Health Initiative studied 46,808 postmenopausal women between 50 and 79 years of age who were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received intensive group and individual counseling from dieticians aimed at reducing fat intake to 20%, increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits to 5 or more servings per day, and increasing consumption of grains to 6 or more servings per day. The control group received dietary education materials. Neither group had weight loss or calorie restriction goals or differences in physical activity. The intervention group had a mean decrease in weight 1.9 kg greater than the controls at 1 year (P<.001) and 0.4 kg at 7.5 years (P<.01). Weight loss was greater in women who consumed more fruits and vegetables and greatest among women who decreased energy intake from fat.

Query 2: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document 2: Evaluate whether weight-loss diets are more effective than regular diets or other antihypertensive therapies in controlling blood pressure and preventing morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults. MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched through November 1997. Trials known to experts in the field were included through June 1998. For inclusion in the review, trials were required to meet each of the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials with one group assigned to a weight-loss diet and the other group assigned to either normal diet or antihypertensive therapy; 2) ambulatory adults with a mean blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic; 3) active intervention consisting of a calorie-restricted diet intended to produce weight loss (excluded studies simultaneously implementing multiple lifestyle interventions where the effects of weight loss could not be disaggregated); and 4) outcome measures included weight loss and blood pressure. Studies were dual abstracted by two independent reviewers using a standardized form designed specifically for this review. The primary mode of analysis was qualitative; graphs of effect sizes for individual studies were also used. Eighteen trials were found. Only one small study of inadequate power reported morbidity and mortality outcomes. None addressed quality of life or general well being issues. In general, participants assigned to weight-reduction groups lost weight compared to control groups. Six trials involving 361 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus a normal diet. The data suggested weight loss in the range of 4% to 8% of body weight was associated with a decrease in blood pressure in the range of 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Three trials involving 363 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus treatment with antihypertensive medications. These suggested that a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications produced greater decreases in blood pressure (in the range of 6/5 mm Hg systolic/diastolic) than did a weight-loss diet. Trials that allowed adjustment of participants' antihypertensive regimens suggested that patients required less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy if they followed a weight-reducing diet. Data was insufficient to determine the relative efficacy of weight-reduction versus changes in sodium or potassium intake or exercise. Weight-reducing diets in overweight hypertensive persons can affect modest weight loss in the range of 3-9% of body weight and are probably associated with modest blood pressure decreases of roughly 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Weight-reducing diets may decrease dosage requirements of persons taking antihypertensive medications.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review of 18 trials with 2611 participants concluded that for overweight hypertensive patients, weight loss of 3% to 9% of body weight is associated with 3 mm Hg decreases in both systolic blood pressure and DBP.

Query: What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol?
Document: Low-carbohydrate diets have become increasingly popular for weight loss. However, evidence from individual trials about benefits and risks of these diets to achieve weight loss and modify cardiovascular risk factors is preliminary. We used the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy to identify trials comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate diets without restriction of energy intake vs low-fat diets in individuals with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of at least 25. Included trials had to report changes in body weight in intention-to-treat analysis and to have a follow-up of at least 6 months. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality of randomized controlled trials. Five trials including a total of 447 individuals fulfilled our inclusion criteria. After 6 months, individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets had lost more weight than individuals randomized to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference, -3.3 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.3 to -1.4 kg). This difference was no longer obvious after 12 months (weighted mean difference, -1.0 kg; 95% CI, -3.5 to 1.5 kg). There were no differences in blood pressure. Triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets (after 6 months, for triglycerides, weighted mean difference, -22.1 mg/dL [-0.25 mmol/L]; 95% CI, -38.1 to -5.3 mg/dL [-0.43 to -0.06 mmol/L]; and for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, weighted mean difference, 4.6 mg/dL [0.12 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1 mg/dL [0.04-0.21 mmol/L]), but total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 6 months, 5.4 mg/dL [0.14 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1 mg/dL [0.03-0.26 mmol/L]). Low-carbohydrate, non-energy-restricted diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. However, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered.
Summary:",The DASH diet was studied as an intervention in a RCT of 116 patients with the metabolic syndrome. Men responded with an in crease of 21% and women with an increase of 33%.

Query 1: When are antibiotics indicated for acute COPD exacerbations?
Document 1: Most patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However the value of their use remains uncertain. Some controlled trials of antibiotics have shown benefit (Berry 1960; Pines 1972) while others have not (Elmes 1965b; Nicotra 1982). To conduct a systematic review of the literature estimating the value of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005); EMBASE (1974 to December 2005); Web of Science (December 2005), and other electronically available databases. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic (for a minimum of five days) and placebo. Data were analysed using Review Manager software. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) (and 95% CI) were calculated for all dichotomous data. Where appropriate, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated. Eleven trials with 917 patients were included. Ten trials used increased cough, sputum volume and purulence diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbation. Eight-hundred and fifty-seven patients provided data for outcomes including mortality, treatment failure, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, PaCO(2), PaO(2), peak flow and adverse events. Antibiotic therapy regardless of antibiotic choice significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17), treatment failure (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62 with NNT of 3; 95% CI 3 to 5) and sputum purulence (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17). There was a small increase in risk of diarrhoea with antibiotics (RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.06 to 7.76). Antibiotics did not improve arterial blood gases and peak flow. This review shows that in COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence antibiotics, regardless of choice, reduce the risk of short-term mortality by 77%, decrease the risk of treatment failure by 53% and the risk of sputum purulence by 44%; with a small increase in the risk of diarrhoea. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in patient selection, antibiotic choice, small number of included trials and lack of control for interventions that influence outcome, such as use of systemic corticosteroids and ventilatory support. Nevertheless, this review supports antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill.
Summary 1: A recent Cochrane review identified 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (with a total of 917 patients) addressing antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbations characterized by 1 or more of the following: an increase in sputum purulence or volume, dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, or fluid retention. Eight trials were conducted on hospital wards, 1 was in a medical intensive care unit, and 2 trials were in the outpatient setting. Antibiotics were given orally in 9 of the 11 studies. Overall, antibiotics reduced risk of short-term mortality by 77% (relative risk [RR]=0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI],0.10-0.52; number needed to treat [NNT]=8), treatment failure by 53% (RR=0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.62; NNT=3), and sputum purulence by 44% (RR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.77; NNT=8). A subgroup analysis that excluded the outpatient and intensive-care unit studies did not change the result. Another subgroup analysis of the 2 outpatient studies failed to find a significant effect, although the studies had very different designs.

Query 2: What is the best macrolide for atypical pneumonia?
Document 2: The efficacy and safety of orally administered clarithromycin and erythromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive either clarithromycin, 250 mg twice a day, or erythromycin stearate, 500 mg 4 times a day, for 7 to 14 days. Efficacy was evaluable in 173 patients (92 for clarithromycin, 81 for erythromycin). No statistically significant difference in clinical success rate (cure or improvement) was observed between the two groups (clarithromycin, 97 percent; erythromycin, 96 percent). Both groups had identical radiologic response (97 percent with resolution or improvement). Similarly, no statistically significant difference in bacteriologic response toward the target pathogens was observed among evaluable patients (clarithromycin, 23/26; erythromycin, 17/17; p value = 0.287). Clinical response toward Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumonia was comparable between the two groups (clarithromycin, 15/16; erythromycin, 10/11). However, patients receiving erythromycin had a twofold higher incidence of adverse events, mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, and were five times more likely to withdraw from therapy because of drug-related adverse events. These results show that clarithromycin is as effective as erythromycin in the outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the lower incidence of adverse events associated with clarithromycin indicates that it is more acceptable to patients and, therefore, can enhance compliance.
Summary 2: A study compared antibiotics for patients with community acquired pneumonia aged 12 to 93 years. Subgroup analysis of those with M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae (n=27) showed similar efficacy. Pooling all 268 patients with CAP, side effects were seen in 31% of patients on clarithromycin and 59% on erythromycin (P<.001).

Query: When are antibiotics indicated for acute COPD exacerbations?
Document: The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotic and placebo therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in exacerbation were compared in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Exacerbations were defined in terms of increased dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence. Exacerbations were followed at 3-day intervals by home visits, and those that resolved in 21 days were designated treatment successes. Treatment failures included exacerbations in which symptoms did not resolve but no intervention was necessary, and those in which the patient's condition deteriorated so that intervention was necessary. Over 3.5 years in 173 patients, 362 exacerbations were treated, 180 with placebo and 182 with antibiotic. The success rate with placebo was 55% and with antibiotic 68%. The rate of failure with deterioration was 19% with placebo and 10% with antibiotic. There was a significant benefit associated with antibiotic. Peak flow recovered more rapidly with antibiotic treatment than with placebo. Side effects were uncommon and did not differ between antibiotic and placebo.
Summary:","A Cochrane review identified a Danish RCT that studied 278 patients presenting to their general practitioners with subjective acute worsening of their COPD. Patients were randomized to 7 days of oral amoxicillin or placebo. There was no difference between the groups in terms of symptom resolution at 1 week (odds ratio=1.03, favoring placebo; 95% CI, 0.75-1.41) or in changes in PEFR (weighted mean difference=-0.89, favoring placebo; 95% CI, -29 to 27 L/min)."

Query 1: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 1: The addition of lithium to the treatment regimens of previously nonresponding depressed patients has been repeatedly investigated in controlled studies. The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of > or = 0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.
Summary 1: Evidence from a meta-analysis with aggregate data from 3 studies representing a total of 110 patients showed that augmentation of various antidepressants with lithium leads to improved outcomes (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.7).

Query 2: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 2: Few controlled studies have addressed the issue of which antidepressant medications should be recommended for outpatients who have not responded to multiple treatment trials. This study compared the efficacy of switching to mirtazapine to that of switching to a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline) following two prospective, consecutive, unsuccessful medication treatments for nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Following lack of remission or an inability to tolerate an initial trial of citalopram for up to 12 weeks (first step) and a second trial with either monotherapy involving another antidepressant or augmentation of citalopram with bupropion or buspirone (second step), adult outpatients (N=235) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine (up to 60 mg/day) (N=114) or nortriptyline (up to 200 mg/day) (N=121). The primary outcome, symptom remission, was defined a priori as a total exit score of </=7 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR(16)), obtained at treatment visits, provided secondary outcomes of remission (score </=5 at exit) and response (>/=50% reduction in score from baseline). For mirtazapine, remission rates were 12.3% and 8.0% per the Hamilton and QIDS-SR(16) scores, respectively. For nortriptyline, remission rates were 19.8% and 12.4%, respectively. QIDS-SR(16) response rates were 13.4% for mirtazapine and 16.5% for nortriptyline. Neither response nor remission rates statistically differed by treatment, nor did these two treatments differ in tolerability or adverse events. Switching to a third antidepressant monotherapy regimen after two consecutive unsuccessful antidepressant trials resulted in low remission rates (<20%) among patients with major depressive disorder.
Summary 2: Further switches in antidepressant monotherapy have a low success rate (10%-20%).

Query: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document: Evidence of the antidepressant efficacy of lamotrigine is increasing, although there are no placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine augmentation in depression. The aim of this study was to assess if augmentation with lamotrigine was superior to placebo in patients who were receiving fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes. Twenty-three patients who had experienced at least 1 major depressive episode that was resistant to at least 1 prior trial of antidepressant therapy were selected. These patients were treated with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, and concomitantly randomly assigned to receive either lamotrigine (N = 13) or placebo (N = 10) for 6 weeks. The dose of lamotrigine was titrated upward from 25 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Patients suffering from bipolar II disorder (N = 8) or from major depressive disorder (N = 15) (DSM-IV criteria) were enrolled, resulting in heterogeneity of the sample. The primary outcome measure was Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. Data were collected from 2000-2001. Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions scale at endpoint, both in absolute terms (mean +/- SD Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores: lamotrigine, 2.15 +/- 1.28; placebo, 3.40 +/- 1.17; p =.0308) and using a responder analysis, with response defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 or less (lamotrigine, 84.62% [N = 11]; placebo, 30.00% [N = 3]; p =.013). The effect of lamotrigine on Clinical Global Impressions scale scores was seen in both major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Lamotrigine, however, failed to separate statistically from placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. This failure to differentiate on a primary outcome measure is essentially a negative study result. This result is most likely an artifact of the small sample size used and the resultant limited power of the study. The results of this trial add to the literature suggesting potential efficacy of the antidepressant profile of lamotrigine. In addition, this study points to a possible role of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in depression.
Summary:",A small (23-patient) randomized trial of lamotrigine (Lamictal) suggests that it may augment the effect of fluoxetine.

Query 1: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 1: More than half of anxiety and depression patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve. We retrospectively examined whether treatment-resistant depression and anxiety disorder patients responded to and tolerated augmentation with the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole. We report on patients with depression and anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had an incomplete response to a variety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and who received augmentation with aripiprazole. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean+/-SD CGI-S was 3.8+/-1.3 at endpoint. Fifty-nine percent of subjects received CGI-I ratings of 1 or 2, 'much improved' or 'very much improved,' in terms of their depression and anxiety symptoms at the end of 12 weeks. Several patients showed an early (weeks 1-5), as well as sustained, response to augmentation with doses of aripiprazole between 15 and 30 mg/day. The results suggest that aripiprazole may be effective as an augmentation for patients with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders despite initial SSRI treatment. Because this is a retrospective case review, further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.
Summary 1: A cohort study of augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic agent such as aripiprazole (Abilify) suggest improved outcomes, but similar studies found no benefit.

Query 2: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 2: After unsuccessful treatment for depression with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it is not known whether switching to one antidepressant is more effective than switching to another. We randomly assigned 727 adult outpatients with a nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms or could not tolerate the SSRI citalopram to receive one of the following drugs for up to 14 weeks: sustained-release bupropion (239 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 400 mg, sertraline (238 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 200 mg, or extended-release venlafaxine (250 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg. The study was conducted in 18 primary and 23 psychiatric care settings. The primary outcome was symptom remission, defined by a total score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) at the end of the study. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR-16), obtained at treatment visits, determined secondary outcomes, including remission (a score of 5 or less at exit) and response (a reduction of 50 percent or more on baseline scores). Remission rates as assessed by the HRSD-17 and the QIDS-SR-16, respectively, were 21.3 percent and 25.5 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 17.6 percent and 26.6 percent for sertraline, and 24.8 percent and 25.0 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. QIDS-SR-16 response rates were 26.1 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 26.7 percent for sertraline, and 28.2 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. These treatments did not differ significantly with respect to outcomes, tolerability, or adverse events. After unsuccessful treatment with an SSRI, approximately one in four patients had a remission of symptoms after switching to another antidepressant. Any one of the medications in the study provided a reasonable second-step choice for patients with depression. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00021528.).
Summary 2: The strongest evidence is from the recent sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression trial, a randomized study that assigned patients in one arm of the study who had no relief from (or did not tolerate) therapy with citalopram (Celexa) to 1 of 3 drugs-sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin SR), sertraline (Zoloft), or extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor XR). The study concluded that approximately 1 in 4 patients have remission after switching to an antidepressant from another drug class.

Query: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document: In medication-resistant patients with major depressive disorder, the response rate with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) drops to 50% from the expected range of 80% to 90%. Relapse rates following ECT are high in medication-resistant depressed patients and are clustered in the first 4 months following clinical response. Medication resistance during the index episode predicts a high rate of relapse, whereas those patients who have not received an adequate medication trial prior to ECT are less likely to relapse. If a patient who fails an antidepressant trial then responds to a course of ECT, alternative pharmacologic strategies or maintenance ECT should be considered to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Patients who do not respond to a traditional course of bilateral ECT may respond subsequently to longer courses of bilateral ECT at markedly suprathreshold stimulus intensity, or may respond to a different class of antidepressant medication from that which they failed previously.
Summary:",The evidence supporting use of ECT for treatment-resistant depression comes from studies following failure of treatment with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Methodological problems in these older studies do not permit an estimate of response rate.

Query 1: At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening?
Document 1: There is growing evidence that faecal-occult-blood (FOB) screening may reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, but this reduction in CRC mortality has not been shown in an unselected population-based randomised controlled trial. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of FOB screening on CRC mortality in such a setting. Between February, 1981, and January, 1991, 152,850 people aged 45-74 years who lived in the Nottingham area of the UK were recruited to our study. Participants were randomly allocated FOB screening (76,466) or no screening (controls; 76,384). Controls were not told about the study and received no intervention. Screening-group participants were sent a Haemoccult FOB test kit with instructions from their family doctor. FOB tests were not rehydrated and dietary restrictions were imposed only for retesting borderline results. Individuals with negative FOB tests at the first screening, together with those who tested positive but in whom no neoplasia was found on colonoscopy, were invited to take part in further screening every 2 years. Screening was stopped in February, 1995, by which time screening-group participants had been offered FOB tests between three and six times. Screening-group participants who had a positive test were offered full colonoscopy. All participants were followed up until June, 1995. The primary outcome measure was CRC mortality. Of the 152,850 individuals recruited to the study, 2599 could not be traced or had emigrated and were excluded from the analysis. Thus, there were 75,253 participants in the screening group and 74,998 controls. 44,838 (59.6%) screening-group participants completed at least one screening. 28,720 (38.2%) of these individuals completed all the FOB tests they were offered and 16,118 (21.4%) completed at least one screening but not all the tests they were offered. 30,415 (40.4%) did not complete any test. Of 893 cancers (20% stage A) diagnosed in screening-group participants (CRC incidence of 1.49 per 1000 person-years), 236 (26.4%) were detected by FOB screening, 249 (27.9%) presented after a negative FOB test or investigation, and 400 (44.8%) presented in non-responders. The incidence of cancer in the control group (856 cases, 11% stage A) was 1.44 per 1000 person-years. Median follow-up was 7.8 years (range 4.5-14.5). 360 people died from CRC in the screening group compared with 420 in the control group-a 15% reduction in cumulative CRC mortality in the screening group (odds ratio=0.85 [95%; CI 0.74-0.98], p = 0.026). Our findings together with evidence from other trials suggest that consideration should be given to a national programme of FOB screening to reduce CRC mortality in the general population.
Summary 1: The upper age limits of patients was 74.

Query 2: At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening?
Document 2: Faecal occult blood testing is routinely used for early detection of colorectal cancer, but evidence of its efficacy in preventing death from colorectal cancer is limited. A case-control study was carried out to evaluate whether screening for faecal occult blood is associated with a reduced risk of fatal colorectal cancer. A health maintenance organisation in western Washington State, which has offered its members faecal occult blood testing every two years since 1983. Cases (n = 248) were members of the health maintenance organisation who died from colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1991. For each case, two control subjects, who did not die from colorectal cancer and who were similar to each case in age, gender, and year of enrollment at the health maintenance organisation, were randomly selected from the membership list of the year in which the case was diagnosed (n = 496). Information about episodes of faecal occult blood testing (including the location and reason for the test, and the evaluation of positive tests) and potential confounders was obtained from medical records. Cases were less likely than controls to have ever been screened (odds ratio (OR) = 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 1.0), consistent with a beneficial impact of screening. There was little difference, however, for screening that had taken place within a three year period before diagnosis (OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2), the maximum interval during which most tumours ought to have been detectable by faecal occult blood testing. A reduction in risk was seen for home testing but not for office testing, and in individuals aged less than 75 but not in those aged 75 or older. Although most of the 21 controls with a positive faecal occult blood test underwent some additional testing, only five (24%) were evaluated with colonoscopy or air contrast barium enema. While there can be uncertainty as to whether specific faecal occult blood tests were performed as screening or diagnostic tests, those performed at home and in younger persons may be relatively less likely to be diagnostic tests that were misclassified as screening. Thus the modest reduced risk associated with faecal occult blood testing in these settings/persons may reflect genuine benefit. However, the presence of a reduced risk associated with a screening faecal occult blood test received in the past, well before a tumour or polyp might bleed enough to allow detection, is compatible with uncontrolled confounding. Interpretation is further complicated by the fact that a number of individuals in the study group who had positive test results underwent limited or no diagnostic testing. Thus our results should be interpreted with considerable caution.
Summary 2: One case control study of fecal occult blood test showed a significant reduction in risk of mortality from colorectal cancer for individuals younger than 75 years, but not for patients older than 75; however, confidence intervals were wide.

Query: At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening?
Document: Case-control studies and a voluntary-based follow-up study have suggested that repeated screening with faecal-occult-blood (FOB) tests can lead to a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this randomised study was to compare mortality rates after FOB tests every 2 years during a 10-year period with those of unscreened similar controls. 140,000 people aged 45-75 years lived in Funen, Denmark, in August, 1985, and were considered for inclusion in our study. Before randomisation we excluded individuals who had CRC or precursor adenomas and those who had taken part in a previous pilot study. Randomisation of 137,485 people in blocks of 14 allocated three per 14 to the screening group (30,967), three per 14 to the control group (30,966), and eight not to be enrolled in the study (75,552). Controls were not told about the study and continued to use health-care facilities as normal. Hemoccult-II blood tests (with dietary restrictions but without rehydration) were sent to screening-group participants. Only those participants who completed the first screening round were invited for further screening--five rounds of screening during a 10-year period. Participants with positive tests were asked to attend to full examination and were offered colonoscopy whenever possible. The primary endpoint was death from CRC. Of the 30,967 screening-group participants, 20,672 (67%) completed the first screening round and were invited for further screening; more than 90% accepted repeated screenings. During the 10-year study, 481 people in the screening group had a diagnosis of CRC, compared with 483 unscreened controls. There were 205 deaths attributable to CRC in the screening group, compared with 249 deaths in controls. CRC mortality, including deaths attributable to complications from CRC treatment, was significantly lower in the screening group than in controls (mortality ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.68-0.99]) p = 0.03). Our findings indicate that biennial screening by FOB tests can reduce CRC mortality. This study is being continued to improve its statistical power and to assess the effect of the removal of more precursor adenomas in the screening-group participants than in controls on CRC incidence.
Summary:",The upper age limits of patients was 75.

Query 1: What treatments are effective for varicose veins?
Document 1: The study was planned to evaluate efficacy and costs of endovascular sclerotherapy (ES) in comparison with surgery and surgery associated with sclerotherapy in a prospective (10-year follow-up), good-clinical-practice study. Patients with varicose veins and pure, superficial venous incompetence were included. Of the patients randomized into the three groups 39 (group A) were treated with ES, 40 (B) with surgery + sclerotherapy, and 42 with surgery only (C). Surgery consisted of ligation of the SFJ (saphenofemoral junction) and of incompetent veins detected with color duplex. Of the preselected 150 patients, 121 subjects entered the study; 96 completed the 10-year follow-up (mean age 52.6 +/- 6 years; 51 men, 45 women). Dropouts were due to nonmedical problems. At 10 years no incompetence was observed in subjects treated with SPJ ligation (B and C). In the ES group 18.8% of the SFJs were patent and incompetent and in 43.8% of limbs the distal (below-knee) venous system was still incompetent [16.1% in the surgery + sclerotherapy group (p < 0.05) and 36% in the group treated with surgery only (p < 0.05 vs B and 0.05 vs A)]. Color duplex of the long saphenous vein indicated atrophy or obstruction of a segment (average 6.7 cm) after SFJ ligation (4.2 cm after ES). The cost of ES was 68% of surgery while the cost of surgery and sclerotherapy was 122% of surgery only. Endovascular sclerotherapy is an effective, cheaper treatment option, but surgery after 10 years is superior.
Summary 1: Belcaro reported results of a 10-year randomized trial including 121 subjects, 96 of whom completed the study. Surgery consisted of ligation of the saphenopopliteal junction without stripping. At 10 years, 16.1% of patients receiving surgery plus sclerotherapy had distal venous incompetence (assessed with color duplex scanning and ambulatory venous pressure measurement), compared with 36.4% of those who underwent surgery alone and 43.8% of those who received sclerotherapy alone. The authors concluded that long-term outcomes (defined as saphenofemoral junction competence) are superior with strategies that included surgery, but at greater cost.

Query 2: What treatments are effective for varicose veins?
Document 2: A randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the clinical outcome 5 years after inpatient surgery and outpatient injection/compression sclerotherapy. 91.3% of those originally treated by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 93.9% of those originally treated surgically were seen at follow-up. 40% of patients treated initially by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 24.2% of those treated surgically were given further treatment. The probability of having no further treatment is significantly greater for those treated surgically. The improved outcome after surgery increased with age, being most striking in those aged over 45. The implications of the 5-year follow-up findings for the long-term cost of treatment are discussed.
Summary 2: Beresford and colleagues also concluded that surgery lessened the likelihood of additional treatment.

Query: What treatments are effective for varicose veins?
Document: Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins has been used widely since 1963, following popularisation of the technique by Fegan. The treatment aims to obliterate the lumen of varicose veins or thread veins, however, there is limited evidence regarding its efficacy. To determine whether sclerotherapy is effective in terms of symptomatic improvement and cosmetic appearance; has an acceptable complication rate; and to define rates of symptomatic or cosmetic varicose vein recurrence following sclerotherapy. Publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins (excluding comparisons with surgery) were sought through EMBASE and MEDLINE (from inception to March 2001) and hand-searching relevant journals, using the search strategy described by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group. Bibliographies of papers identified were examined for further RCTs. Manufacturers of sclerosants were contacted for further trial information. RCTs of injection sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings or 'observation', or comparing different sclerosants, doses and post-compression bandaging techniques on patients with symptomatic and/or cosmetic varicose veins or thread veins were considered for inclusion in the review. Ten studies were included in the analysis. These compared: sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) versus an alternative sclerosant; sclerosant with or without local anaesthetic; application of Molefoam versus Sorbo pads to injection sites; elastic compression bandaging versus conventional bandaging; and short-term bandaging versus standard bandaging. Data were abstracted by both authors. No RCTs compared sclerotherapy to graduated compression stockings or other non-surgical treatments. Two studies compared STD to alternative sclerosants and found no significant differences in outcome or complication rates. Adding local anaesthetic to sclerosant reduced the pain from injection (one study) but had no other effects. Comparison of Molefoam and Sorbo pad pressure dressings found no difference in outcome for erythema (redness) or successful sclerosis. The degree and duration of elastic compression had no significant effect on varicose vein recurrence rates, cosmetic appearance or symptomatic improvement. Increased compression prevented slipping of dressings but caused increased discomfort, as did increasing duration of compression. Evidence from RCTs suggests that type of sclerosant, local pressure dressing, degree and length of compression have no significant effect on the efficacy of sclerotherapy for varicose veins. This supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery, and thread veins. A comparison of surgery versus sclerotherapy would be valuable.
Summary:","A Cochrane review concluded that existing evidence supports the use of sclerotherapy for recurrent varicose veins after surgery and for relatively minor ""thread"" veins. Data did not show that any particular type of sclerosant or pressure dressing or duration of post-treatment compression have significant effect on outcomes, such as disappearance of varicosities and cosmetic improvement."

Query 1: Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective?
Document 1: Large segments of the population at risk for osteoporosis and fracture have not been evaluated, and the usefulness of peripheral measurements for short-term prediction of fracture risk is uncertain. To describe the occurrence of low bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women, its risk factors, and fracture incidence during short-term follow-up. The National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment, a longitudinal observational study initiated September 1997 to March 1999, with approximately 12 months of subsequent follow-up. A total of 200 160 ambulatory postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older with no previous osteoporosis diagnosis, derived from 4236 primary care practices in 34 states. Baseline BMD T scores, obtained from peripheral bone densitometry performed at the heel, finger, or forearm; risk factors for low BMD, derived from questionnaire responses; and clinical fracture rates at 12-month follow-up. Using World Health Organization criteria, 39.6% had osteopenia (T score of -1 to -2.49) and 7.2% had osteoporosis (T score </=-2.5). Age, personal or family history of fracture, Asian or Hispanic heritage, smoking, and cortisone use were associated with significantly increased likelihood of osteoporosis; higher body mass index, African American heritage, estrogen or diuretic use, exercise, and alcohol consumption significantly decreased the likelihood. Among the 163 979 participants with follow-up information, osteoporosis was associated with a fracture rate approximately 4 times that of normal BMD (rate ratio, 4.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.59-4.53) and osteopenia was associated with a 1.8-fold higher rate (95% CI, 1.49-2.18). Almost half of this population had previously undetected low BMD, including 7% with osteoporosis. Peripheral BMD results were highly predictive of fracture risk. Given the economic and social costs of osteoporotic fractures, strategies to identify and manage osteoporosis in the primary care setting need to be established and implemented.
Summary 1: In a prospective observational study of women over 50 years of age, 39.6% had osteopenia and 7.2% had osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was associated with a fracture rate 4 times that of normal bone mineral density.

Query 2: What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis?
Document 2: Risedronate increases bone mineral density in elderly women, but whether it prevents hip fracture is not known. We studied 5445 women 70 to 79 years old who had osteoporosis (indicated by a T score for bone mineral density at the femoral neck that was more than 4 SD below the mean peak value in young adults [-4] or lower than -3 plus a nonskeletal risk factor for hip fracture, such as poor gait or a propensity to fall) and 3886 women at least 80 years old who had at least one nonskeletal risk factor for hip fracture or low bone mineral density at the femoral neck (T score, lower than -4 or lower than -3 plus a hip-axis length of 11.1 cm or greater). The women were randomly assigned to receive treatment with oral risedronate (2.5 or 5.0 mg daily) or placebo for three years. The primary end point was the occurrence of hip fracture. Overall, the incidence of hip fracture among all the women assigned to risedronate was 2.8 percent, as compared with 3.9 percent among those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.9; P=0.02). In the group of women with osteoporosis (those 70 to 79 years old), the incidence of hip fracture among those assigned to risedronate was 1.9 percent, as compared with 3.2 percent among those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.9; P=0.009). In the group of women selected primarily on the basis of nonskeletal risk factors (those at least 80 years of age), the incidence of hip fracture was 4.2 percent among those assigned to risedronate and 5.1 percent among those assigned to placebo (P=0.35). Risedronate significantly reduces the risk of hip fracture among elderly women with confirmed osteoporosis but not among elderly women selected primarily on the basis of risk factors other than low bone mineral density.
Summary 2: Alendronate and risedronate have both reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures and increased bone mineral density in clinical trials. The pooled risk estimates for alendronate's antifracture effect are 48% to 53% vertebral and hip fracture reduction and 30% reduction of all clinical fractures (relative risk [RR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.82).1 Risedronate reduced hip fractures in osteoporotic women aged 70 to 79 years (RR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), but women 80 years and older with nonskeletal risk factors did not benefit.

Query: Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective?
Document: Although mass screening for osteoporosis is not recommended among postmenopausal women, there is no consensus on which women should undergo testing for low bone mineral density. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a clinical tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk for osteoporosis and should therefore undergo further testing with bone densitometry. Using Ontario baseline data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, we identified all cognitively normal women aged 45 years or more who had undergone testing with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at both the femoral neck and the lumbar spine (L1-L4). Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone active medication other than ovarian hormones were excluded. The main outcome measure was low bone mineral density (T score of 2 or more standard deviations below the mean for young Canadian women) at either the femoral neck or the lumbar spine. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to identify the simplest algorithm that would identify women at increased risk for low bone mineral density. The study population comprised 1376 women, of whom 926 were allocated to the development of the tool and 450 to its validation. A simple algorithm based on age, weight and current estrogen use (yes or no) was developed. Validation of this 3-item Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI) showed that the tool had a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.3%-97.0%) and a specificity of 46.4% (95% CI 41.0%-51.8%) for selecting women with low bone mineral density. The sensitivity of the instrument for selecting women with osteoporosis was 94.4% (95% CI 83.7%-98.6%). Use of the ORAI represented a 38.7% reduction in DXA testing compared with screening all women in our study. The ORAI accurately identifies the vast majority of women likely to have low bone mineral density and is effective in substantially decreasing the need for all women to undergo DXA testing.
Summary:","For women aged >65 years with no other risks, 12% to 28% have osteoporosis."

Query 1: Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer?
Document 1: To synthesize new data on breast cancer screening for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MEDLINE; the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry; and reference lists of reviews, editorials, and original studies. Eight randomized, controlled trials of mammography and 2 trials evaluating breast self-examination were included. One hundred fifty-four publications of the results of these trials, as well as selected articles about the test characteristics and harms associated with screening, were examined. Predefined criteria were used to assess the quality of each study. Meta-analyses using a Bayesian random-effects model were conducted to provide summary relative risk estimates and credible intervals (CrIs) for the effectiveness of screening with mammography in reducing death from breast cancer. For studies of fair quality or better, the summary relative risk was 0.84 (95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.91) and the number needed to screen to prevent one death from breast cancer after approximately 14 years of observation was 1224 (CrI, 665 to 2564). Among women younger than 50 years of age, the summary relative risk associated with mammography was 0.85 (CrI, 0.73 to 0.99) and the number needed to screen to prevent one death from breast cancer after 14 years of observation was 1792 (CrI, 764 to 10 540). For clinical breast examination and breast self-examination, evidence from randomized trials is inconclusive. In the randomized, controlled trials, mammography reduced breast cancer mortality rates among women 40 to 74 years of age. Greater absolute risk reduction was seen among older women. Because these results incorporate several rounds of screening, the actual number of mammograms needed to prevent one death from breast cancer is higher. In addition, each screening has associated risks and costs.
Summary 1: The CNBSS-2 trial showed no mortality advantage when mammography was added to an annual, standardized 10- to 15-minute breast examination, implying that careful, detailed, annual clinical breast examinations may be as effective as a mammography screening program.

Query 2: Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective?
Document 2: To determine the ability of measurements of bone density in women to predict later fractures. Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published between 1985 and end of 1994 with a baseline measurement of bone density in women and subsequent follow up for fractures. For comparative purposes, we also reviewed case control studies of hip fractures published between 1990 and 1994. Eleven separate study populations with about 90,000 person years of observation time and over 2000 fractures. Relative risk of fracture for a decrease in bone mineral density of one standard deviation below age adjusted mean. All measuring sites had similar predictive abilities (relative risk 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.6)) for decrease in bone mineral density except for measurement at spine for predicting vertebral fractures (relative risk 2.3 (1.9 to 2.8)) and measurement at hip for hip fractures (2.6 (2.0 to 3.5)). These results are in accordance with results of case-control studies. Predictive ability of decrease in bone mass was roughly similar to (or, for hip or spine measurements, better than) that of a 1 SD increase in blood pressure for stroke and better than a 1 SD increase in serum cholesterol concentration for cardiovascular disease. Measurements of bone mineral density can predict fracture risk but cannot identify individuals who will have a fracture. We do not recommend a programme of screening menopausal women for osteoporosis by measuring bone density.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort trials showed that all sites of bone mineral density measurements correlated with fractures (relative risk [RR], 1.5; 95% confi-dence interval [CI], 1.4-1.6.). However, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the femoral neck predicted hip fracture better than other measures (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.0-3.5).

Query: Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective?
Document: To review the effect of risedronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women. We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to the end of 2000 and examined citations of relevant articles and the proceedings of international osteoporosis meetings. We included eight randomized, placebo-controlled trials of postmenopausal women receiving risedronate or placebo with a follow-up of at least one year and providing data on bone density or fracture rate. For each trial, two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data. The major methodological limitation of the trials was the loss to follow-up, which was over 20% in most trials and over 35% in the largest study. However, the magnitude of the treatment effect was unrelated to loss to follow-up, and in one of the largest trials, more high-risk patients were lost to follow-up in the control than in the treatment group. The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in women given 2.5 mg or more of risedronate was 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 0.77]. The pooled RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 2.5 mg or more of risedronate was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61, 0.87). Risedronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density of the lumbar spine, combined forearm, and femoral neck that were generally larger with the 5-mg daily dose than with cyclical administration or the 2.5-mg dose. The pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between 5 mg risedronate and placebo after the final year of treatment (1.5-3 yr) was 4.54% (95% CI 4.12, 4.97) for the lumbar spine, and 2.75% (95% CI 2.32, 3.17) at the femoral neck. Risedronate substantially reduces the risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. This fracture reduction is accompanied by an increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck in both early postmenopausal women and those with established osteoporosis.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials including 11,808 women found fewer hip fractures in women taking 10 mg/day of alendronate (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.69; number needed to treat [NNT]=24), and fewer vertebral fractures in women taking 5 mg/day of alendronate (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.65; NNT=72)."

Query 2: Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy?
Document 2: Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates. All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966-2001), HealthSTAR (1975-2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes. We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes. Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64-2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33-5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0-2.9) after 5 years of use. Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.
Summary 2: The findings of the women's health initiative and HERS trials have been summarized in a recent meta-analysis done for the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Query: Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective?
Document: Although osteoporotic fractures present an enormous health burden, it is not clear whether screening to identify high-risk persons is appropriate. To examine evidence on the benefits and harms of screening postmenopausal women for osteoporosis. MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001), HealthSTAR (1975 to May 2001), and Cochrane databases; reference lists; and experts. English-language abstracts that included original data about postmenopausal women and osteoporosis and addressed the effectiveness of risk factor assessment, bone density tests, or treatment were included. Selected information about patient population, interventions, clinical end points, and study design were extracted, and a set of criteria was applied to evaluate study quality. No trials of the effectiveness of screening have been published. Instruments developed to assess clinical risk factors for low bone density or fractures have moderate to high sensitivity and low specificity. Among different bone density tests measured at various sites, bone density measured at the femoral neck by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is the best predictor of hip fracture. Women with low bone density have approximately a 40% to 50% reduction in fracture risk when treated with bisphosphonates. Population screening would be based on evidence that the risk for osteoporosis and fractures increases with age, that the short-term risk for fracture can be estimated by bone density tests and risk factors, and that fracture risk can be reduced with treatment. The role of risk factor assessment and different bone density techniques, frequency of screening, and identification of subgroups for which screening is most effective remain unclear.
Summary:","Based on their outcomes model, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for women aged >65 years, and those aged 60 to 65 years who have risk factors."

Query 1: Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack?
Document 1: Management of patients with acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) varies widely, with some institutions admitting all patients and others proceeding with outpatient evaluations. Defining the short-term prognosis and risk factors for stroke after TIA may provide guidance in determining which patients need rapid evaluation. To determine the short-term risk of stroke and other adverse events after emergency department (ED) diagnosis of TIA. Cohort study conducted from March 1997 through February 1998 in 16 hospitals in a health maintenance organization in northern California. Patients A total of 1707 patients (mean age, 72 years) identified by ED physicians as having presented with TIA. Risk of stroke during the 90 days after index TIA; other events, including death, recurrent TIA, and hospitalization for cardiovascular events. During the 90 days after index TIA, 180 patients (10.5%) returned to the ED with a stroke, 91 of which occurred in the first 2 days. Five factors were independently associated with stroke: age greater than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.7; P=.01), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; P<.001), symptom duration longer than 10 minutes (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2; P=.005), weakness (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6; P<.001), and speech impairment (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P=.01). Stroke or other adverse events occurred in 428 patients (25.1%) in the 90 days after the TIA and included 44 hospitalizations for cardiovascular events (2.6%), 45 deaths (2.6%), and 216 recurrent TIAs (12.7%). Our results indicate that the short-term risk of stroke and other adverse events among patients who present to an ED with a TIA is substantial. Characteristics of the patient and the TIA may be useful for identifying patients who may benefit from expeditious evaluation and treatment.
Summary 1: In a large retrospective cohort study, 5% of TIA patients returned to the emergency department with a stroke within the first 2 days after TIA. Another 6% returned with a stroke within 90 days. Five independent risk factors were identified: age >60 years, diabetes mellitus, duration of TIA longer than 10 minutes, signs or symptoms of weakness, and speech impairment. Thirty-four percent of patients with all 5 risk factors, and none of the patients without any risk factors, had a stroke within 90 days. Of note, 13% of the TIA patients had an arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or recurrent TIA within 4 days of initial presenting with a TIA. Twenty-five percent of the patients experienced 1 of these cardiovascular events during the 3 months of follow-up.

Query 2: Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack?
Document 2: To evaluate the investigation and treatment of patients with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the emergency department (ED) a tertiary care teaching hospital with a neuroscience referral program. A chart review was conducted in the hospital. Consecutive ED charts with a diagnosis of TIA were included; each was reviewed by independent coders using a standardized data form. Two hundred and ninety-three TIA charts were reviewed; the gender ratio was 1:1 with a mean age of 66 years. Most patients (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80) were evaluated by ED physicians; the remaining patients were seen directly by referral services. The median time from symptom onset to ED arrival was 29 hours and the duration of symptoms was 4.6 hours. Most patients received CT scans (81%; 95% CI: 73, 85), complete blood counts (74%; 95% CI: 68, 79), and electrocardiograms (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80) in the ED. In 16% (95% CI: 13, 22) a carotid doppler was performed and in 26% (95% CI: 21, 31) an outpatient doppler was booked. Among those who were discharged (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80), antithrombotic medications were not prescribed to 28% (95% CI: 22, 34). Practice variation exists with respect to the investigation and treatment of TIAs in this tertiary-care teaching hospital. Carotid doppler investigation and use of anti-platelet therapy for patients with TIA are suboptimal. Clinical practice guidelines and rapid assessment TIA clinics may change these results.
Summary 2: In 1 study of TIA patients presenting to an emergency department, 81% had a computed tomography scan, 75% had electrocardiogram, and 74% had a complete blood count. Carotid Doppler imaging was performed in the emergency department in 16%, and 26% were referred for outpatient Doppler studies. One percent had an electrocardiogram in the emergency department, and 16% were given ECGs as outpatients. Seventy-five percent of patients were discharged home. Those hospitalized had a median length of stay of 1 day.

Query: Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack?
Document: To estimate the very early stroke risk after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke and thereby inform the planning of effective stroke prevention services. Population based prospective cohort study of patients with TIA or stroke. Nine general practices in Oxfordshire, England, from April 2002 to April 2003. All patients who had a TIA (n = 87) or minor stroke (n = 87) during the study period and who presented to medical attention. Risk of recurrent stroke at seven days, one month, and three months after TIAs and minor strokes. The estimated risk of recurrent stroke was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 2.3% to 13.7%) at seven days, 11.5% (4.8% to 18.2%) at one month, and 17.3% (9.3% to 25.3%) at three months after a TIA. The risks at these three time periods after a minor stroke were 11.5% (4.8% to 11.2%), 15.0% (7.5% to 22.5%), and 18.5% (10.3% to 26.7%). The early risks of stroke after a TIA or minor stroke are much higher than commonly quoted. More research is needed to determine whether these risks can be reduced by more rapid instigation of preventive treatment.
Summary:",A large prospective cohort study recently estimated the risk of stroke after a TIA or minor stroke to be 8% to 12% at 7 days and 11% to 15% at 1 month.

Query 1: What are the current treatment and monitoring recommendations for hepatitis C virus HCV?
Document 1: Pilot studies suggested that more patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection had a sustained virological response when treated with the combination of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with interferon alpha-2b alone. We investigated the biochemical and virological responses and safety of treatment with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b alone. In this double-blind trial 100 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (3 MU three times a week) in combination with ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks and then followed up for a further 24 weeks. A further follow-up was done 1 year after active treatment stopped. The primary endpoint was the sustained virological response, defined as no detectable HCV RNA by PCR at both week 24 and week 48. Retrospectively, the baseline HCV-RNA load was analysed as a predictor of a sustained virological response. Data were analysed by intention to treat. 18 (36%) of the 50 patients in the interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin group had a sustained virological response compared with nine (18%) of the 50 patients in the interferon alpha-2b and placebo group (p = 0.047). At the 1 year follow-up the proportion of patients with a virological response was greater in the interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin group than the interferon alpha-2b and placebo group (42 vs 20%, p = 0.03), respectively. More patients with baseline HCV-RNA concentrations greater than 3 x 10(6) genome equivalents (Eq) per mL had a sustained response with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with interferon alpha-2b and placebo (12/29 vs 1/26, p = 0.009), whereas the sustained response did not differ between the two treatment groups for HCV-RNA amounts less than 3 x 10(6) Eq per mL (6/21 vs 8/24, p = 0.67), respectively. More patients with chronic hepatitis C have a sustained virological response with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with only interferon alpha-2b treatment. We suggest that patients with high HCV-RNA loads should be treated with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin.
Summary 1: Long-term sustained viral response was at least 50% at 2 years after dual therapy. Long-term response rates have been 30% with dual therapy in genotype 1 and 60% to 70% with genotypes 2 through 6.

Query 2: What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne?
Document 2: One hundred two patients with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris completed a 12-week, investigator-masked, randomized, parallel-group comparison of a gel formation of erythromycin (2%) with clindamycin phosphate 1% solution. Patients were evaluated at a baseline visit and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of twice-daily treatment. Both medications significantly reduced the numbers of papules and open and closed comedones. No significant differences in lesion count reductions were detected between the treatment groups after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. By the end of 12 weeks, 48% of the patients in the erythromycin group and 47% in the clindamycin group had good or excellent responses to treatment. No patient was terminated from the study for side effects. Most patients, 65% in the erythromycin 2% gel group and 67% in the clindamycin phosphate 1% solution group, had a favorable impression of the overall cosmetic characteristics of their study medication.
Summary 2: Both 1% clindamycin and 2% erythromycin were comparable in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions for patients with moderate acne.

Query: What are the current treatment and monitoring recommendations for hepatitis C virus HCV?
Document: Only 15 to 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C have a sustained virologic response to interferon therapy. We compared the efficacy and safety of recombinant interferon alfa-2b alone with those of a combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for the initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We randomly assigned 912 patients with chronic hepatitis C to receive standard-dose interferon alfa-2b alone or in combination with ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg orally per day, depending on body weight) for 24 or 48 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by measurements of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and serum aminotransferases and by liver biopsy. The rate of sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA level 24 weeks after treatment was completed) was higher among patients who received combination therapy for either 24 weeks (70 of 228 patients, 31 percent) or 48 weeks (87 of 228 patients, 38 percent) than among patients who received interferon alone for either 24 weeks (13 of 231 patients, 6 percent) or 48 weeks (29 of 225 patients, 13 percent) (P<0.001 for the comparison of interferon alone with both 24 weeks and 48 weeks of combination treatment). Among patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, the best response occurred in those who were treated for 48 weeks with interferon and ribavirin. Histologic improvement was more common in patients who were treated with combination therapy for either 24 weeks (57 percent) or 48 weeks (61 percent) than in those who were treated with interferon alone for either 24 weeks (44 percent) or 48 weeks (41 percent). The drug doses had to be reduced and treatment discontinued more often in patients who were treated with combination therapy. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, initial therapy with interferon and ribavirin was more effective than treatment with interferon alone.
Summary:","Several randomized trials have shown that dual therapy with PEG-interferon alpha-2b (3 million units subcutaneously 3 times weekly) and ribavirin (1000 mg to 1200 mg orally each day) is at least twice as effective as interferon alone. The best results were seen in women who had a genotype other than 1, low viral loads, and absence of cirrhosis at the outset."

Query 1: Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes?
Document 1: Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms are tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Most symptomatic cases are treated non-surgically. The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (January 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2008) and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2008). We checked bibliographies in papers and contacted authors for information about other published or unpublished studies. We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials. In this update we found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them including 295 participants, 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials including 245 participants described outcome at six month follow-up, also favouring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39).Two trials reported clinical improvement at one year follow-up. They included 198 patients favouring surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53). The only trial describing changes in neurophysiological parameters in both groups also favoured surgery (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97). Two trials described need for surgery during follow-up, including 198 patients. The pooled estimate for this outcome indicates that a significant proportion of people treated medically will require surgery while the risk of re-operation in surgically treated people is low (RR 0.04 favouring surgery, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.17). Complications of surgery and medical treatment were described by two trials with 226 participants. Although the incidence of complications was high in both groups, they were significantly more common in the surgical arm (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76). Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting. Further research is needed to discover whether this conclusion applies to people with mild symptoms and whether surgical treatment is better than steroid injection.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review based on only 1 randomized controlled trials of 22 patients published in 1964 concluded that surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome appears to be more effective than wrist splinting.

Query 2: Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes?
Document 2: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be treated with nonsurgical or surgical options. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of splinting and surgery for relieving the symptoms of CTS. A randomized controlled trial conducted from October 1998 to April 2000 at 13 neurological outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 176 patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were assigned to wrist splinting during the night for at least 6 weeks (89 patients) or open carpal tunnel release (87 patients); 147 patients (84%) completed the final follow-up assessment 18 months after randomization. General improvement, number of nights waking up due to symptoms, and severity of symptoms. In the intention-to-treat analyses, surgery was more effective than splinting on all outcome measures. The success rates (based on general improvement) after 3 months were 80% for the surgery group (62/78 patients) vs 54% for the splinting group (46/86 patients), which is a difference of 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-40%; P<.001). After 18 months, the success rates increased to 90% for the surgery group (61/68 patients) vs 75% for the splinting group (59/79 patients), which is a difference of 15% (95% CI, 3%-27%; P =.02). However, by that time 41% of patients (32/79) in the splint group had also received the surgery treatment. Treatment with open carpal tunnel release surgery resulted in better outcomes than treatment with wrist splinting for patients with CTS.
Summary 2: A well-designed randomized controlled trials of 176 patients published since that Cochrane review stated that with regard to overall improvement of symptoms and function status, surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome was more effective than wrist splinting 18 months posttreatment. The investigators found that surgery resulted in worse short-term outcomes at 1 month follow-up (29% vs 42% success), but by 3 months the improvement in all outcomes was greater in the surgery group (80% vs 54% success). The number needed to treat (NNT) over 18 months was only 2 patients in the treatment-received (per protocol) analysis (92% vs 37% success) and 7 in the intention-to-treat analysis (90% vs 75% success). Patients in the conservative treatment group who underwent surgery after splinting had failed had a higher success rate after 18 months follow-up than patients who did not have surgery (94% vs 62% success rate; number needed to treat = 3).

Query: What is the best diagnostic approach to paresthesias of the hand?
Document: History taking and physical examination maneuvers, including Tinel and Phalen signs, are widely used for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). To systematically review the precision and accuracy of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing CTS in adults. English-language literature was searched using MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2000) as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. Studies of patients presenting to clinicians with symptoms suggestive of CTS in which findings from clearly described physical examination maneuvers were independently compared with electrodiagnostic testing. Twelve of 42 initially identified articles met these criteria and were included in the review. Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all of the articles and reached consensus about any discrepancies. In patients presenting with hand dysesthesias, the findings that best distinguish between patients with electrodiagnostic evidence of CTS and patients without it are hypalgesia in the median nerve territory (likelihood ratio [LR], 3. 1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-5.1), classic or probable Katz hand diagram results (LR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.5), and weak thumb abduction strength (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Findings that argue against the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome are unlikely Katz hand diagram results (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7) and normal thumb abduction strength (LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7). Several traditional findings of CTS have little or no diagnostic value, including nocturnal paresthesias; Phalen and Tinel signs; thenar atrophy; and 2-point, vibratory, and monofilament sensory testing. Other less commonly used maneuvers, including the square wrist sign, flick sign, and closed fist sign, require validation by other studies before they can be recommended. Hand symptom diagrams, hypalgesia, and thumb abduction strength testing are helpful in establishing the [corrected] electrodiagnosis of CTS. The utility of these results is limited, however, by problems inherent in using nerve conduction studies as a criterion standard. JAMA. 2000.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of studies reviewing the precision and accuracy of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of CTS in adults found that hypoalgesia (LR+, 3.1), classic or probable hand diagram results (LR+ 2.4, LR- 0.2), and weak thumb abduction strength (weakness of resisted movement of the thumb at right angles to the palm; LR+ 1.8, LR- 0.5) best distinguish those with and those without CTS. A classical distribution is in that of the median nerve, while a probable distribution involves the entire palmar surface. The reference standard for these studies was a nerve conduction study. Nocturnal paresthesias, Phalen and Tinel signs, and thenar atrophy had little or no diagnostic utility."

Query 1: How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain?
Document 1: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. To assess the effectiveness of the most common conservative types of treatment for patients with acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain. Many treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are available, but little is known about the optimal treatment strategy. A rating system was used to assess the strength of the evidence, based on the methodologic quality of the randomized controlled trials, the relevance of the outcome measures, and the consistency of the results. The number of randomized controlled trials identified varied widely with regard to the interventions involved. The scores ranged from 20 to 79 points for acute low back pain and from 19 to 79 points for chronic low back pain on a 100-point scale, indicating the overall poor quality of the trials. Overall, only 28 (35%) randomized controlled trials on acute low back pain and 20 (25%) on chronic low back pain had a methodologic score of 50 or more points, and were considered to be of high quality. Various methodologic flaws were identified. Strong evidence was found for the effectiveness of muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the ineffectiveness of exercise therapy for acute low back pain; strong evidence also was found for the effectiveness of manipulation, back schools, and exercise therapy for chronic low back pain, especially for short-term effects. The quality of the design, execution, and reporting of randomized controlled trials should be improved, to establish strong evidence for the effectiveness of the various therapeutic interventions for acute and chronic low back pain.
Summary 1: A review reported that exercise, back manipulation, and intense back schools were equally efficacious.

Query 2: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 2: Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of exercise training as an treatment for FMS. We searched 6 electronic bibliographies for studies of exercise training in FMS: MEDLINE (1966-12/2000), CINAHL (1982-12/2000), HealthSTAR (1990-12/2000), Sports Discus (1975-05/2000), EMBASE (1974-05/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 4). We also reviewed the reference lists from identified articles including reviews and meta-analyses of treatment studies. Randomized trials focused on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength and/or flexibility as treatment for FMS were selected. Two reviewers independently identified trials meeting inclusion criteria, rated the methodologic quality using 2 standardized validated instruments, evaluated the adequacy of the exercise training stimulus using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria and evaluated the results. Disagreements were resolved through active discussion and consensus. High quality training studies had scores of 50% or greater on van Tulder methodologic criteria and met the minimum training standards of ACSM. Outcome variables were grouped into 7 constructs: pain, tender points, physical function, global well being, self efficacy, fatigue & sleep, and psychological function. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, results and point estimates for selected variables, and used consensus to address discrepancies. Sixteen trials involving a total of 724 participants were assigned at random to: exercise intervention groups (n=379), control groups (n=277), or groups receiving an alternate treatment (n=68). Seven studies were high quality training studies: 4 aerobic training, 1 a mixture of aerobic, strength and flexibility training, 1 strength training and 2 with exercise training as part of a composite treatment. Flexibility protocols were never described in sufficient detail to allow evaluation. The four high quality aerobic training studies reported significantly greater improvements in the exercise groups versus control groups in aerobic performance (17.1% increase in aerobic performance with exercise versus 0.5% increase in the control groups), tender point pain pressure threshold (28.1% increase versus 7.0% decrease) and improvements in pain (11.4% decrease in pain versus 1.6% increase). Poor description of exercise protocols was common, with insufficient information on intensity, duration, frequency and mode of exercise. Adverse events were also poorly reported. Supervised aerobic exercise training has beneficial effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms. Strength training may also have benefits on some FMS symptoms. Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed. Research on the long-term benefit of exercise for FMS is needed.
Summary 2: We examined the results of a systematic review of exercise for treating fibromyalgia. The authors found 7 high-quality studies, 4 of aerobic training, and concluded that supervised aerobic exercise training had beneficial effects on physical capacity, tender-point threshold, and pain. Other investigators have questioned the usefulness of aerobic exercise because long-term benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor.

Query: How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain?
Document: Criteria-based review. Reviews based on trials published up to 1990 conclude that the efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with low back pain is questionable. To determine from recently published trials the efficacy of exercises in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic back pain. A Medline search for randomized trials concerning exercise therapy in patients with back pain published from 1991 until the first quarter of 1995 was conducted. All studies were given a method score (maximum, 100 points). Eleven randomized trials were included: four in acute back pain, one in subacute, and six in patients with chronic back pain. Three trials had method scores lower than 40 points. For acute back pain, two trials with high method scores (> 50 points) reported no efficacy of flexion or extension exercises; two trials of the McKenzie type of exercises reported positive results but had low method scores. For subacute pain, one trial (> 50 points) reported positive results of exercises with a graded activity program. For chronic back pain, three trials reported positive results with different types of exercises; two trials reported better results with intensive exercising compared with low grade exercising, but after 12 months, this effect had disappeared. In chronic pain, no relation between method score and conclusions could be found. In acute back pain, exercise therapy is ineffective, whereas in subacute back pain, exercises with a graded activity program, and in chronic back pain, intensive exercising, deserve attention. More research on McKenzie therapy, on exercises with a graded activity program, and on different types of exercising in patients with chronic back pain is necessary.
Summary:","A 1996 review of 13 RCTs examining specific types of exercises found that both intensive dynamic extension exercises and mild isometric flexion and extension exercises were more effective than placebo. Although the intensive exercises were more efficacious than normal exercises at the 3-month follow-up, they were equally efficacious at 12 months. Evidence was conflicting in a comparison of flexion and extension exercises."

Query 1: What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal?
Document 1: There is considerable variability in the literature concerning the optimal treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early surgical fixation of acute Jones fractures will result in shorter times to union and return to athletics compared with cast treatment. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Eighteen patients were randomized to cast treatment, and 19 patients were randomized to screw fixation. Success of treatment and the times to union and return to sports were calculated for each patient. Mean follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 15-42 months). Eight of 18 (44%) in the cast group were considered treatment failures: 5 nonunions, 1 delayed union, and 2 refractures. One of 19 patients in the surgery group was considered a treatment failure. For the surgery group, the median times to union and return to sports were 7.5 and 8.0 weeks, respectively. For the cast group, the median times were 14.5 and 15.0 weeks, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in both parameters, with P < 001. There is a high incidence (44%) of failure after cast treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early screw fixation results in quicker times to union and return to sports compared with cast treatment.
Summary 1: The rates and times of union with short leg casting vary over a wide range in the research literature. The casting group in the randomized controlled trials above had union rates of 56% and median time to union of 14.5 weeks (lower and upper quartile range, 10.5-18.5).

Query 2: What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal?
Document 2: Successful treatment of avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal has been achieved using both short leg casts and soft (Jones) dressings. Sixty patients who presented to our institution were prospectively randomized to be treated with either a short leg cast or a soft (Jones) dressing for the purpose of assessing the efficacy of each treatment modality. Our results demonstrated that radiographic evidence of fracture healing was present in all patients by 65 days with 44 days representing the average elapsed time for such change. All patients returned to full weightbearing and full physical activity within 96 days. Significantly, the average length of recuperation for patients treated with a soft (jones) dressing was 33 days as compared to 46 days for those treated with a short leg cast. Also, the average modified foot score for patients treated in a soft dressing was 92 (excellent) compared to 86 (good) for patients treated in a short leg cast. We conclude that a soft dressing allows patients to return to pre-injury levels of activity faster than when treated in a short leg cast and without compromising clinical or radiographic union of avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Summary 2: A 12-week randomized controlled trials in 89 consecutive patients presenting to an emergency department with fifth metatarsal tuberosity avulsion fractures compared a nonrigid, soft Jones' dressing consisting of alternating layers of cast padding and elastic bandages with a rigid short leg casting. The Jones' dressing had a significant 28% reduction in time to return to pre-injury levels of activity. Other outcomes-time in treatment modality, time to radiographic healing, and functional foot score-were not different between intervention groups. Validity was limited by the 32% lost to follow-up rate.

There is a high incidence (44%) of failure after cast treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early screw fixation results in quicker times to union and return to sports compared with cast treatment.
Summary:","37 active-duty military personnel with acute Jones' fractures were randomized to either 8 weeks of no weight-bearing in a short leg casting, followed by a walking cast or hard-soled shoe until clinical union; or to early outpatient intramedullary screw fixation followed by no weight-bearing for 2 weeks, then weight-bearing as tolerated in a hard-soled shoe until clinical union. Screw fixation significantly reduced both time to clinical union and time to return to sports-by nearly 50% when compared with non-weightbearing short leg casting. Furthermore, at 26 weeks the casting group saw a significant 44% failure rate compared with only 5% in the surgical group (number needed to treat [NNT]=2.6). Six patients in the surgical group had mild discomfort from the screw head, and 3 needed the screw to be removed. Generalization of the results was limited by the mostly male military population."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document 1: This review was designed to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on effects of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children. A systematic review of published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on probiotics in the treatment or prevention of acute diarrhea defined as >3 loose or watery stools per 24 hours in infants and children. The use of probiotics as compared with placebo was associated with a significantly reduced risk of diarrhea lasting >3 days. The pooled estimate risk was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.34-0.53) with a fixed-effect model, and remained significant in a random-effect model (0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.57). Only Lactobacillus GG showed a consistent effect. Probiotics significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea when compared with placebo, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis-the pooled, weighted, mean difference (WMD) assuming the random-effect model was -20.1 hours (95% CI, -26.1 to -14.2) and -24.8 (95% CI, -31.8 to -17.9) respectively. A meta-analysis of the prevention studies was not feasible because of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity. There is evidence of a clinically significant benefit of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis. Lactobacillus GG showed the most consistent effect, although other probiotic strains may also be effective. Further research is needed. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the prophylactic interventions preclude drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics in preventing acute gastroenteritis.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children. Lactobacillus supplementation reduced the risk of diarrhea persisting more than 3 days (relative risk [RR]=0.43; 95% CI, 0.34-0.53; P<.001; number needed to treat [NNT]=4).

Query 2: What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant?
Document 2: This article reviews and synthesizes evidence in the published literature on the safety and efficacy of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) among young children with pediatric gastroenteritis in developed nations. We searched the literature for randomized, controlled trials comparing the safety and efficacy of ORT with intravenous (IV) rehydration treatment and/or oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) of different sodium content. We combined the failure rates of each set of studies in statistical meta-analyses and conducted tests of homogeneity of treatment effect over all the studies and for subgroups of children defined by the trial type, the sodium content of the ORS, and the setting of care. We also conducted a multivariate logistic regression on the probability of failure to determine the relative importance of these factors, controlling for other characteristics of the trials. Other outcomes were also tabulated and discussed. These include the relative incidence of hypernatremia and hyponatremia induced by treatment; weight gain; the volume, frequency, and duration of diarrhea; for inpatient trials, the length of stay; and for outpatient trials, rates of hospitalization. The evidence suggests that among pediatric patients with gastroenteritis in developed countries, failure of ORT, defined as the need to rehydrate children intravenously, is infrequent. We found a combined overall ORT failure rate of 3.6%. We found no statistically significant difference in failure rates by trial type or the sodium content of the ORS. However, we did find some supporting evidence for a lower failure rate among children treated in outpatient settings. In addition, compared with patients rehydrated intravenously, pediatric patients treated with ORT were not found to be at higher risk of iatrogenic hypernatremia or hyponatremia. The evidence from the literature fails to show a consistent trend in favor of either high- or low-sodium solutions for rehydration of pediatric patients. There seems to be a great potential for improving the medical treatment of children with acute gastroenteritis by the greater use of ORT.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developed countries demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral fluids compared with IV fluids, with an overall failure rate of only 3.6% for infants and children treated with oral rehydrating solution (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.8). There was no significant difference between oral rehydrating solution of varying sodium concentrations, and no increased risk of hypernatremia or hyponatremia compared with the IV treatment arm.

Query: What are effective therapies for Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea?
Document: OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and efficacy of a new combination treatment for patients with Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDD). The treatment combines the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii with an antibiotic (vancomycin hydrochloride or metronidazole). DESIGN--A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group intervention study in patients with active CDD. Patients received standard antibiotics and S boulardii or placebo for 4 weeks, and were followed up for an additional 4 weeks after therapy. Effectiveness was determined by comparing the recurrence of CDD in the two groups using multivariate analysis to control for other risk factors for CDD. SETTING--National referral study of ambulatory or hospitalized patients from three main study coordinating centers. PATIENTS--A total of 124 eligible consenting adult patients, including 64 who were enrolled with an initial episode of CDD, and 60 who had a history of at least one prior CDD episode. Patients who were immunosuppressed due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or cancer chemotherapy within 3 months were not eligible. INTERVENTION--Treatment with oral S boulardii (1 g/d for 4 weeks) or placebo in combination with a standard antibiotic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Recurrence of active CDD. RESULTS--A history of CDD episodes dramatically increased the likelihood of further recurrences. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients treated with S boulardii and standard antibiotics had a significantly lower relative risk (RR) of CDD recurrence (RR, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.97) compared with placebo and standard antibiotics. The efficacy of S boulardii was significant (recurrence rate 34.6%, compared with 64.7% on placebo; P = .04) in patients with recurrent CDD, but not in patients with initial CDD (recurrence rate 19.3% compared with 24.2% on placebo; P = .86). There were no serious adverse reactions associated with S boulardii. CONCLUSIONS--The combination of standard antibiotics and S boulardii was shown to be an effective and safe therapy for these patients with recurrent CDD; no benefit of S boulardii was demonstrated for those with an initial episode of CDD.
Summary:","A randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled study evaluated the impact of adding the probiotic agent Saccharomyces boulardii. to either metronidazole or vancomycin. For persons with recurrent infection, addition of S boulardii. led to a 30% decrease in the absolute risk of relapse (64% relapse vs 34%; number needed to treat=3; P.<.05). There was also a nonsignificant trend toward reduced recurrences in the treatment of primary infections. The 2 minor side effects noted with this treatment were dry mouth (number needed to harm [NNH]=11) and constipation (NNH=9). S boulardii. capsules are available from health food stores and via the Internet. Several published case series describe various additional approaches to therapy of recurrent CDAD."

Query 1: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 1: Using an evidence-based technique, systematically review the literature to evaluate the accuracy of routine clinical history and physical examination in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in the pediatric patient. The biomedical literature was systematically reviewed. Articles comparing the results of clinical evaluation to polysomnography (PSG) were selected. The level of evidence was assessed using established evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines. Twelve articles were identified using the search criteria. Eleven of 12 articles concluded that clinical evaluation is inaccurate in the diagnosis of OSAHS. The level of evidence was good to very good (Grade B/B+). Clinical history and physical examination are not reliable for diagnosing OSAHS compared with overnight PSG. Complicating the interpretation of this work is the lack of a validated PSG threshold of clinically significant disease. There is an urgent need for the development of adequate screening tests with validated clinical outcomes. B-3.
Summary 1: A systematic review of 12 studies including 1058 children under age 18 compared evaluation by polysomnography with clinical evaluation by history and physical examination alone. Clinical evaluation had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 55.8% (95% CI, 42.1%-69.6%); no single component demonstrated sensitivity and specificity more than 65%.

Query 2: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 2: To identify the clinical factor(s) that identify obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in children. A prospective study of children referred to the sleep clinic of the paediatric department was conducted in a public non-teaching regional hospital in Hong Kong. A standard questionnaire was administered and overnight sleep polysomnography was performed in a consecutive series of patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain significant risk factors for prediction of OSAS in this series of patients. Sixty-two children were enrolled into the study and 22 were diagnosed to have OSAS. Logistic regression analysis showed that, among all the answers, 'snoring every night' is the single most significant risk factor (p<0.0001) to predict OSAS. 'Snoring every night' has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 75% for OSAS patients. It also has a positive predictive value of 67% and negative predictive value of 94%. Snoring every night is an important risk factor in identifying OSAS in children. Priority for an overnight sleep polysomnogram should be given to those with this symptom.
Summary 2: A prospective case-series of 62 consecutive children referred to a sleep clinic for suspected obstructive sleep apnea correlated nightly snoring (relative risk [RR]=10.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.72-41.8) and observed apnea (RR=3.43; 95% CI, 1.42-6.76) with obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed by polysomnography.

Query: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document: To review literature on epidemiology, complications, diagnosis, and treatment of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Literature search of MEDLINE up to July 2004 using the following key words: 'obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome', 'children', 'epidemiology', 'complications', 'treatment', and 'polysomnography'. Literature and data related to the aspects of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Relevant information and data were reviewed by the authors. There is a paucity of normal data on childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Varying definitions and diagnostic criteria have been used in different studies, making direct comparison difficult. However, a small-scale local study found that the prevalence and clinical features of this condition were similar to data published overseas. Increasing evidence suggests that childhood obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and neurocognitive dysfunction. Overnight polysomnography has remained the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea but the diagnostic criteria has not been standardised nor correlated with the long-term outcome. Surgical intervention has remained the treatment of choice, although alternative therapies are being evaluated. Consensus on the various important aspects of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea is still limited, especially the definition, diagnosis, and long-term sequelae of this condition. Further advances can only be made with international collaborative research, using evidence-based definitions, standardised techniques, and polysomnographic criteria.
Summary:",Experts advise screening all children for obstructive sleep apnea by asking about snoring and sleep apnea at routine health supervision visits.

Query 1: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 1: To assess the presence of a first night effect (FNE) in children and adolescents and to examine if a single night polysomnography (PSG) is sufficient for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Prospective case study of 70 patients (group 1: 2-6 years, n = 22; group 2: 7-12 years, n = 32; group 3: 13-17 years, n = 16) referred for OSAS. Diagnostic criteria for OSAS: one or more of the following: (1) obstructive apnoea index (OAI) > or =1; (2) obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (oAHI) > or =2; (3) SaO2 < or =89% in association with obstruction. In all age groups, but mainly in the oldest children, REMS increased during the second night, mainly at the expense of stage 2 sleep. The first night PSG correctly identified OSAS in 86%, 91%, and 100% of the children for groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This represents 9% false negatives for OSAS when only the first night PSG was used. All cases missed had mild OSAS, except for one with oAHI >5 on night 2. There were also seven patients with OSAS on night 1 but with a normal PSG on night 2: all had oAHI <5. There is a FNE in children and adolescents. A single night PSG is sufficient for diagnosing OSAS, but in cases with a suggestive history and examination and with a negative first night, a second night study might be advisable.
Summary 1: An investigator-blinded RCT, scored 20-minute recordings of ""worst breathing"" in 59 consecutive children referred for snoring or nocturnal breathing problems, 47% of whom had sleep apnea. Results: PPV=62%, NPV=83%, sensitivity=88%, specificity=52%.

Query 1: When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 1: To determine the utility of pulse oximetry for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. We performed a cross-sectional study of 349 patients referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for possible OSA. A mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI) greater than or equal to 1 on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) defined OSA. A sleep laboratory physician read nocturnal oximetry trend and event graphs, blinded to clinical and polysomnographic results. Likelihood ratios were used to determine the change in probability of having OSA before and after oximetry results were known. Of 349 patients, 210 (60%) had OSA as defined polysomnographically. Oximetry trend graphs were classified as positive for OSA in 93 and negative or inconclusive in 256 patients. Of the 93 oximetry results read as positive, PSG confirmed OSA in 90 patients. A positive oximetry trend graph had a likelihood ratio of 19.4, increasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 97%. The median MOAHI of children with a positive oximetry result was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2). The 3 false-positive oximetry results were all in the subgroup of 92 children who had diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy that might have affected breathing during sleep. A negative or inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of.58, decreasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 47%. Interobserver reliability for oximetry readings was very good to excellent (kappa =.80). In the setting of a child suspected of having OSA, a positive nocturnal oximetry trend graph has at least a 97% positive predictive value. Oximetry could: 1) be the definitive diagnostic test for straightforward OSA attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children older than 12 months of age, or 2) quickly and inexpensively identify children with a history suggesting sleep-disordered breathing who would require PSG to elucidate the type and severity. A negative oximetry result cannot be used to rule out OSA.
Summary 1: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 349 children between the ages of 6 months and 18 years determined that abnormal home pulse oximetry studies were highly predictive of obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography (positive likelihood ratio [LR+]=19.4; CIs not given; posttest probability=97%), but that inconclusive or normal pulse oximetry studies were not predictive of negative polysomnographies (LR+=0.58; CIs not given; posttest probability 47%). Children had been referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea, and the pretest probability was 60%. Oximetry records were evaluated by a sleep laboratory physician blinded to clinical and polysomnography data.

Document: Overnight polysomnography (ONP) is the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, daytime nap studies have been used as screening tests. If the findings of a nap study are normal or mildly abnormal, should ONP be performed? Do specific abnormalities in nap studies predict abnormal findings in ONP? To answer these questions, we conducted this study. Retrospective chart review. Children's hospital. One hundred forty-three children with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome secondary to isolated adenotonsillar hypertrophy, who had normal or mildly abnormal nap studies, and underwent ONP. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTs: We compared daytime nap and overnight polysomnograms in 143 children (52 girls; mean [+/- SD] age, 5.6 +/- 3.1 years). Total sleep time was 1 h in daytime nap, and 5.1 +/- 1.3 h in ONP. The interval between the two studies was 5.9 +/- 4.8 months. The findings of 59% of the nap studies were mildly abnormal, while 66% of overnight studies were abnormal. No individual nap study parameter (including short obstructive apneas, hypopneas, hypoxemia, hypoventilation, snoring, paradoxical breathing, gasping, retractions) had good sensitivity at predicting abnormal overnight polysomnograms, but most had good specificity and positive predictive value. We conclude that individual nap study parameters are not very sensitive in predicting abnormal ONP findings. However, when nap study parameters are abnormal, the chance of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is high.
Summary:","A retrospective chart review included 143 children between 1 and 18 years of age with adenotonsillar hypertrophy referred for overnight polysomnography after normal or mildly abnormal ""nap polysomnography."" Mildly abnormal nap polysomnography predicted abnormal overnight polysomnography (PPV=77%; P<.0001), but normal nap polysomnography were not predictive of normal overnight polysomnography (NPV=49%; P=.8)."

Query 1: Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives?
Document 1: With the exception of rifampin-like drugs, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the ability of commonly prescribed antibiotics, including all those routinely employed in outpatient dentistry, to either reduce blood levels and/or the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. To date, all clinical trials studying the effects of concomitant antibiotic therapy (with the exception of rifampin and rifabutin) have failed to demonstrate an interaction. Like all drugs, oral contraceptives are not 100% effective with the failure rate in the typical United States population reported to be as high as 3%. It is thus possible that the case reports of unintended pregnancies during antibiotic therapy may simply represent the normal failure rate of these drugs. Considering that both drug classes are prescribed frequently to women of childbearing potential, one would expect a much higher rate of oral contraceptive failure in this group of patients if a true drug:drug interaction existed. On the other hand, if the interaction does exist but is a relatively rare event, occurring in, say, 1 in 5000 women, clinical studies such as those described in this article would not detect the interaction. The pharmacokinetic studies of simultaneous antibiotic and oral contraceptive ingestion, and the retrospective studies of pregnancy rates among oral contraceptive users exposed to antibiotics, all suffer from one potential common weakness, i.e., their relatively small sample size. Sample sizes in the pharmacokinetic trials ranged from 7 to 24 participants, whereas the largest retrospective study of pregnancy rates still evaluated less than 800 total contraceptive users. Still, the incidence of such a rare interaction would not differ from the accepted normal failure rate of oral contraceptive therapy. The medico-legal ramifications of what looks like at best a rare interaction remains somewhat ""murky."" On one hand, we have medico-legal experts advising the profession to exercise caution and warn all oral contraceptive users of a potential reduction in efficacy during antibiotic therapy. These opinions are not evidence-based and rely heavily on one or two legal proceedings that cannot even be substantiated. On the other hand, there is one recently published legal proceeding in which the outcome was in favor of the oral surgeon. There is clearly a need for additional scientific research in oral contraceptive users that incorporates larger sample sizes, different time courses (prophylactic use versus standard 7-10 day use versus extended use), and different delivery systems (systemic administration versus local-controlled delivery) of antibiotic therapy. Though experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction, and for clinicians to advise them to employ additional barrier techniques of birth control during antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week beyond the last dose [40], it is hoped that a set of guidelines regarding this controversy will eventually be published that is evidence-based, and not solely the results of anecdotal reports, expert opinions, and legal proceedings.
Summary 1: It is possible, however, that a true interaction between antibiotics and OCs may only manifest itself in the very small subset of women who have unusually low steroid hormone levels. These women may be identified by symptoms of breakthrough bleeding, cramping, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, or by unwanted pregnancy.

Summary 2: Multiple studies have looked at oral contraceptive serum levels with and without antibiotic treatment. These studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 system, capable of reducing serum estrogen and progestin levels, and a small-scale study has suggested breakthrough ovulation among 2 of 9 women taking oral contraceptives and rifampin.

Query 1: Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives?
Document 1: To evaluate the evidence on possible drug interactions between antibiotics and oral contraceptives (OCs) that may lead to OC failure. MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,"" ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32 articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications. Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted. At least 30 cases have been reported of pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin. Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins. Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However, individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.
Summary 1: More than 200 occurrences have been reported anecdotally, in adverse-event monitoring systems, and in retrospective surveys of oral contraceptive failure for women treated with various antibiotics. But no prospective RCTs have been done, and most of the retrospective case series have not used control groups. All the pharmacokinetic and retrospective studies have a small sample size, which may conceal an interaction within the normal oral contraceptive failure rate. 4 retrospective surveys on women taking OCs who were treated with antibiotics (erythromycin, tetracycline, minocycline, penicillin, ampicillin, sulfa, cephalosporins) found oral contraceptive failure rates of 1.2% to 1.6%, within the range for typical populations. Studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives.

These studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives.

Query: Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives?
Document: To evaluate the evidence on possible drug interactions between antibiotics and oral contraceptives (OCs) that may lead to OC failure. MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,"" ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32 articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications. Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted. At least 30 cases have been reported of pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin. Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins. Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However, individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.
Summary:","The women most likely to have pill failure are those with low rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation, high rates of hepatic conjugation, low plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol, extensive intestinal hydrolysis of estrogen conjugates, or gut flora particularly susceptible to the antibiotic. Unfortunately, they cannot be identified by any routine diagnostic tests. The most conservative approach emphasizes patient education and additional forms of nonhormonal contraception for any woman on OCs during any antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week after treatment."

Query 1: Should you treat a symptomatic patient by phone when his child has confirmed strep throat?
Document 1: Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.
Summary 1: Only 5% to 10% of adults and 20% to 25% of children presenting in an office setting with acute pharyngitis actually have group a beta-hemolytic streptococci pharyngitis. The prevalence of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci pharyngitis is higher for patients presenting to urgent care centers or emergency rooms than office practices. Of the primary clinical prediction rules for pharyngitis, only the Walsh Diagnostic Algorithm explicitly includes a history of streptococcal exposure. In that algorithm, only patients with tender or enlarged cervical lymph nodes who either had exudative pharyngitis or a recent exposure were in the highest risk category (23% prevalence of GABHS).

Summary 2: A systematic review of the diagnosis of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci evaluated the accuracy of history and physical exam elements. Clinical prediction rules based on selected symptoms and signs can identify patients at low risk for GABHS. The 4 Centor criteria (history of fever, anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, absence of cough) are well validated in adult populations, while other clinical prediction rules (such as McIssac) are validated in populations with children and adults. The number of criteria present determines the likelihood ratio (LR), with which to calculate the posttest probability of GABHS.

Summary:","According to 1 meta-analysis, a history of exposure to strep in the previous 2 weeks had a sensitivity of 19%, with a specificity ranging from 87% to 94%. This results in a likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.9 if the patient has an exposure (eg, the patient's odds of having strep are 1.9 times higher than baseline), and a patient without an exposure has an LR of 0.94. (Typically, LRs of 0.5 to 2.0 are not helpful for diagnostic testing). In a population at a 10% risk of GABHS as the cause of pharyngitis, the positive predictive value of streptococcal exposure was 17%, and the negative predictive value of no known exposure was 91%."

Query 1: What's the best test for HSV-2 after exposure?
Document 1: Most current enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) differentiate inadequately between types 1 and 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) antibodies since significant cross-reactivity exists. We compared 4 IgG type-specific EIAs using a Western blot assay for resolution of discrepant results. The Diamedix had sensitivities of 100% for types 1 and 2 but specificities of only 71% and 61%, respectively. The cross-reactivity rate was 82% in positive samples tested. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Zeus sensitivities were 92% and 98%, respectively; specificities were 72% and 79%, respectively; the cross-reactivity rate was 54%. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Wampole sensitivities were 98% and 95%, respectively; specificities were 68% and 85%, respectively; the cross-reactivity rate was 47%. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Meridian sensitivities were 98% and 90%, respectively; specificities were 96% and 100%, respectively; no cross-reactivity was found between positive samples tested. While the Diamedix, Zeus, and Wampole assays showed good sensitivity, they lacked type specificity. The Meridian EIA offers the highest specificity along with no observed cross-reactivity. This EIA may be an easier, reliable alternative to Western blot for the determination of HSV type-specific antibodies.
Summary 1: Using the Western blot technique as the gold standard, a total of 158 serum samples from patients with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection-without mention of symptomatology-were used to compare the performance of several commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. The glycoprotein G and non-glycoprotein G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were both found to have sensitivities >90%, but the non-glycoprotein G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests had specificities under 90%. In 47% to 82% of the samples tested with non-glycoprotein G ELISA, there was cross-reactivity between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies.

Query 2: What is the role of herpes virus serology in sexually transmitted disease screening?
Document 2: The acquisition of genital herpes during pregnancy has been associated with spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and congenital and neonatal herpes. The frequency of seroconversion, maternal symptoms of the disease, and the timing of its greatest effect on the outcome of pregnancy have not been systematically studied. We studied 7046 pregnant women whom serologic tests showed to be at risk for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Serum samples obtained at the first prenatal visit, at approximately 16 and 24 weeks, and during labor were tested for antibodies to HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) by the Western blot assay, and the results were correlated with the occurrence of antenatal genital infections. Ninety-four of the women became seropositive for HSV; 34 of the 94 women (36 percent) had symptoms consistent with herpes infection. Women who were initially seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 had an estimated chance of seroconversion for either virus of 3.7 percent; those who were initially seropositive only for HSV-1 had an estimated chance of HSV-2 seroconversion of 1.7 percent; and those who were initially HSV-2-seropositive had an estimated chance of zero for acquiring HSV-1 infection. Among the 60 of the 94 pregnancies for which the time of acquisition of HSV infection was known, 30 percent of the infections occurred in the first trimester, 30 percent in the second, and 40 percent in the third. HSV seroconversion completed by the time of labor was not associated with an increase in neonatal morbidity or with any cases of congenital herpes infection. However, among the infants born to nine women who acquired genital HSV infection shortly before labor, neonatal HSV infection occurred in four infants, of whom one died. Two percent or more of susceptible women acquire HSV infection during pregnancy. Acquisition of infection with seroconversion completed before labor does not appear to affect the outcome of pregnancy, but infection acquired near the time of labor is associated with neonatal herpes and perinatal morbidity.
Summary 2: The primary goal for screening pregnant women is prevention of neonatal transmission of HSV. A prospective observational study of 7046 women found that acquisition of HSV-2 during pregnancy was asymptomatic in 74% of 94 cases. No increase in neonatal or pregnancy-related morbidity was seen for those patients who had seroconverted by the time of labor. The main benefit of serology testing during pregnancy has been to identify patients with asymptomatic infection and counsel them on reporting new symptoms for evaluation and treatment.

Query: What's the best test for HSV-2 after exposure?
Document: In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.
Summary:",The College of American Pathologists found that 46% to 84% of laboratories using non-glycoprotein G ELISA tests incorrectly identified an HSV-1 sample as being HSV-2. All laboratories reporting use of glycoprotein G ELISA tests correctly identified the sample as containing only HSV-1 antibodies.

Query 1: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document 1: The aim, in conservative management of vesico-ureteric reflux by antimicrobial prophylaxis, is to prevent recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and consequent renal scarring. However, the effects of this prophylactic strategy are difficult to evaluate, since the required studies comparing children on prophylaxis with controls (without prophylaxis but under careful supervision) are lacking. Furthermore, the optimal length of prophylaxis needs to be defined. Since risk of renal scarring is believed to occur more frequently in young people, and since recurrent urinary infections mainly affect girls, the age and sex of subjects are important in the design of a prophylactic regimen. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are the most common agents used for long-term, low-dose antibacterial prophylaxis. Break-through infections still result from non-compliance and from development of bacterial resistance, the latter mainly arising with trimethoprim. Few studies of prophylactic drugs are available that adequately define patient materials and include a random allocation to the different agents. Further studies of the effects of alternative prophylactic agents are called for, preferably combined with fresh insight into the ecological impact on the bowel and periurethral floras.
Summary 1: No randomized controlled trials assess whether prophylaxis prevents the development of new renal scars in children.

Query 2: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document 2: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis. Five trials involving 463 children were performed. Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P <.01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02). Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.
Summary 2: A systematic review evaluated the use of antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infection in children. This review of 5 randomized controlled trials included a total of 463 children between the ages of 2 months to 16 years. Three out of 5 trials evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for 2 to 6 months to prevent subsequent off-treatment recurrence. The 2 smaller trials (n=71) evaluated the use of low-dose long-term antibiotics to prevent UTI. Benefits for long-term prophylaxis are even less clear in children with low-grade reflux (I-II).

Query: Which UTI therapies are safe and effective during breastfeeding?
Document: Quinolone-induced cartilage toxicity has been observed in experimental juvenile animal studies and is species- and dose-specific. Accordingly these findings have led to the contraindication of fluoroquinolones in children. Previous data in 634 adolescents and children treated with compassionate use ciprofloxacin demonstrated low rates of reversible arthralgia and a safety profile similar to that for adult patients. This report describes the safety findings in 1795 children who received 2030 treatment courses of intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin. The average doses of intravenous and oral ciprofloxacin in the study population were 8 and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Treatment-associated events were reported in 10.9% of children receiving oral ciprofloxacin compared with 18.9% among intravenous recipients. Overall arthralgia occurred during 31 ciprofloxacin treatment courses (1.5%) and the majority of events were of mild to moderate severity and resolved without intervention. More than 60% of arthralgia episodes were in children with cystic fibrosis. The adverse event pattern in children receiving ciprofloxacin in this analysis was similar to that observed in adults. Rates of reversible arthralgia were low and unchanged from previously published surveillance data in children.
Summary:","A report was published summarizing safety data from the Bayer database of compassionate use of ciprofloxacin. The report indicates that 2030 treatment courses of ciprofloxacin were given to 1795 children up to age 17 for a variety of infections; only 3% were under age 5. Most patients received 21 to 40 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin per day; treatment duration was from 1 to 303 days. Arthralgia occurred in 1.5% of patients, most of whom had cystic fibrosis. Of the 31 patients affected, arthralgias resolved in 25, improved in 1, and remained unchanged in 1. (Data regarding resolution were unavailable for 4 patients.)"

Query 1: Does regular exercise reduce the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis?
Document 1: Therapeutic exercise is used as one modality to treat people with osteoarthritis (OA). To evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise of differing intensities on objective and subjective measures of disease activity in people with OA. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pedro, Current Contents, Sports Discus and CINAHL up to and including December 2002. The Cochrane Field of Rehabilitation and Related Therapies and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group were also contacted for a search of their specialized registers. Handsearching was conducted on all retrieved articles for additional studies. Comparative controlled studies, such as randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies or case/control studies, of therapeutic exercises compared to control or active interventions in people with OA were eligible. No language restrictions were applied. Abstracts were also accepted. Two independent reviewers identified potential articles from the literature search. These reviewers extracted data using pre-defined extraction forms. Consensus was reached on all data extraction. The two reviewers used a five point scale to assess the quality of the selected articles. Randomization, double-blinding and description of withdrawals were assessed. One study involving 39 participants met the inclusion criteria. The review indicates that there were no significant differences between high intensity and low intensity aerobic exercise on participants with OA of the knee for functional status, gait, pain and aerobic capacity (Mangione 1999). Both high intensity and low intensity aerobic exercise appear to be equally effective in improving a patient's functional status, gait, pain and aerobic capacity for people with OA of the knee. Further research involving a greater number of subjects, and a larger number of studies involving a control group is needed to further substantiate these results.
Summary 1: In a Cochrane systematic review that evaluated the intensity of exercise, only 1 study with 39 participants met the inclusion criteria. This limited-power study found no difference between the effect of low-intensity and high-intensity exercise on pain reduction or function.

Document 2: To determine whether land based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee in terms of reduced joint pain, improved physical function, and/or the patient's global assessment of therapeutic effectiveness. Five databases were searched for randomized clinical trials. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study and then combined using a fixed effects model. Only 2 studies, totaling about 100 participants, could potentially provide data on people with hip OA. Fourteen studies provided data on 1633 participants with knee OA. Nine of these studies were considered of high methodological quality. For pain, combining the results revealed a mean moderate beneficial effect (SMD 0.46, 95% Cl 0.35, 0.57), while for self-reported physical function a mean small beneficial effect (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.23, 0.43) was found. These results appeared to be sensitive to blinding of outcome assessor and choice of control group. Land based therapeutic exercise was shown to reduce pain and improve physical function for people with OA of the knee.
Summary 2: A systematic review examined the effect of therapeutic exercise on hip and knee osteoarthritis. The standardized mean difference in effect size for pain reduction was moderate, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.35-0.57). For self-reported physical functioning, the standardized mean difference was small, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.23-0.43). Study limitations included enrollment of patients with only early or mild osteoarthritis, low numbers of intent-to-treat studies, short-term nature of the studies, and inadequate sample sizes.

Document: To compare the efficacy of aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercises in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The Medline, Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases and the Cochrane controlled trials register were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of subjects with knee osteoarthritis comparing aerobic walking or home based quadriceps strengthening exercise with a non-exercise control group. Methodological quality of retrieved RCTs was assessed. Outcome data were abstracted for pain and self reported disability and the effect size calculated for each outcome. RCTs were grouped according to exercise mode and the data pooled using both fixed and random effects models. 35 RCTs were identified, 13 of which met inclusion criteria and provided data suitable for further analysis. Pooled effect sizes for pain were 0.52 for aerobic walking and 0.39 for quadriceps strengthening. For self reported disability, pooled effect sizes were 0.46 for aerobic walking and 0.32 for quadriceps strengthening. Both aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercise reduce pain and disability from knee osteoarthritis but no difference between them was found on indirect comparison.
Summary:","A 2005 systematic review examined aerobic walking and quadriceps strengthening for knee osteoarthritis using pain as the primary outcome and self-reported disability as the secondary outcome. In the exercise group, the weighted, pooled ES for pain reduction and self-reported disability was moderate at 0.52 (95% CI, 0.34-0.70) and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.25-0.67) respectively. The quadriceps strengthening group showed a small weighted, pooled ES for pain reduction of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23-0.42) and disability of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23-0.41); pain and disability measures were variable. None of the included clinical trials were blinded."

Query 1: What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents?
Document 1: The authors sought to replicate open-label findings showing that specific criteria for explosive temper and mood lability identify disruptive youth who improve while receiving the anticonvulsant divalproex sodium. Twenty outpatient children and adolescents (ages 10-18) with a disruptive behavior disorder (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder) met the specific criteria for explosive temper and mood lability. They received 6 weeks of divalproex treatment and 6 weeks of placebo by random assignment. Independent evaluators blind to group assignment assessed response at the end of each phase. At the end of phase 1, eight of 10 subjects had responded to divalproex; zero of 10 had responded to placebo. Of the 15 subjects who completed both phases, 12 has superior response taking divalproex. This preliminary study replicates open-label findings showing that divalproex is an efficacious treatment for explosive temper and mood lability in disruptive children and adolescents.
Summary 1: A double-blind crossover randomized controlled trials evaluated divalproex (Depakote) vs placebo for 20 children (aged 10 to 18 years) with explosive temper and mood lability who also met DSM-IV criteria for either oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Patients with significant medical problems, such as bipolar disorder, major depression, or mental retardation, were excluded. Divalproex significantly (P=.003) reduced aggressive behaviors and anger-hostility items by approximately 33% as reported by child, parent, school, and clinician on 2 standardized scales.

Query 2: What are effective treatments for oppositional and defiant behaviors in preadolescents?
Document 2: Behavior problems in children are an important social, educational, and health issue. The prevalence of these problems, their stability over time, their poor prognosis, and their costs to both individuals and the society, all point to the need for primary prevention and early effective interventions. A systematic review examined the effectiveness of group parent education programs that aimed to improve behavior problems in 3- to 10-year-old children. The phrase ""parent education program"" is used here to refer to group-based programs with a standardized format aimed at enhancing parenting skills. The term ""behavior problems"" is used to refer to children exhibiting externalizing problems such as temper tantrums, aggression, and noncompliance. It does not include children diagnosed as having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This review focused explicitly on measures of child behavioral outcomes, which are only small, albeit important, outcomes of parent education programs. Reviews focusing on other clinically relevant outcomes are also needed, including parental well-being and attitudes towards parenting. Other reviews are also needed to collate evidence concerning the effectiveness of parent education programs with other age-groups, i.e., preschoolers and adolescents, and in improving other aspects of child well-being. The review included published studies only and as such may have been influenced by a ""publication bias."" Inclusion criteria comprised the use of a waiting list, a no-treatment or placebo control group, and at least one standardized measure assessing the child's behavior. Only studies published after 1970 that included at least one ""group-based"" parent education program were included. A total of 255 primary studies were identified, but only 16 of these and 2 follow-up studies met all of the specified inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal of these 16 studies revealed considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, the populations studied, and the outcome measures used. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that structured parent education programs can be effective in producing positive change in both parental perceptions and objective measures of children's behavior and that these changes are maintained over time. Because of the small number of controlled studies and their methodological variations, caution should be exercised before these findings are generalized broadly.
Summary 2: A rigorous well-done systematic review looked at 16 randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of training programs for children between the ages of 3 and 10 years who had externalizing problems, including temper tantrums, aggression, and noncompliance. All studies included in the review compared a group-based parent training program with a no-treatment wait-list control group and assessed outcomes using a standardized measure of behavior. In studies where sufficient data were provided, effect sizes ranged from 0.6 to 2.9. This indicates that, on a standardized child behavioral measure, parental report of children's externalizing problems decreased by 0.6 to 2.9 standard deviations from pre- to posttreatment (an effect size of >0.8 is considered large). In the 2 studies that included independent observations of child behavior, the benefits reported by parents were confirmed by these observations.

Query: What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents?
Document: Conduct disorder is a common childhood psychiatric problem that has an increased incidence in adolescence. The primary diagnostic features of conduct disorder include aggression, theft, vandalism, violations of rules and/or lying. For a diagnosis, these behaviors must occur for at least a six-month period. Conduct disorder has a multifactorial etiology that includes biologic, psychosocial and familial factors. The differential diagnosis of conduct disorder includes oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorder and intermittent explosive disorder. Family physicians may provide brief, behaviorally focused parent counseling, pharmacotherapy and referral for more intensive family and individual psychotherapy.

Query 1: Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip?
Document 1: Deep-vein thrombosis is a well-recognized complication after trauma to the legs and subsequent immobilization, but there are no generally accepted approaches to preventing this complication. We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous reviparin (1750 anti-Xa units given once daily) in 440 patients who required immobilization in a plaster cast or brace for at least five weeks after a leg fracture or rupture of the Achilles tendon. The study drug was given throughout the period of immobilization. Venography of the injured leg was performed within one week after removal of the plaster cast or brace, or earlier if there were symptoms suggesting deep-vein thrombosis. Data on efficacy and end points were available for 371 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 17 of the 183 patients randomly assigned to receive reviparin (9 percent) and in 35 of the 188 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo (19 percent) (odds ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.82). Most of the thromboses were distal (14 in the reviparin group and 25 in the placebo group). There were two cases of pulmonary embolism, both in patients in the placebo group who also had proximal deep-vein thrombosis. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding or other adverse events. Deep-vein thrombosis is common in persons with leg injury requiring prolonged immobilization. Reviparin given once daily appears to be effective and safe in reducing the risk of this complication.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials evaluated reviparin (another European LMWH) vs placebo in 440 outpatients with lower limb injuries, of whom 293 had fractures. About half had surgical management and all were treated with a plaster cast or brace for an average of 44 days. Most were ambulatory with crutches. All underwent venography within a week of cast removal. The deep venous thrombosis rate for fracture patients using reviparin was 10.4%, vs 18.2% among those without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis (absolute risk reduction=7.8%; NNT=12.8). Three fourths of the DVTs were in distal veins, and 21% of the DVTs in the low-molecular-weight heparin patients occurred in deep veins compared with 34% in patients without. Two pulmonary emboli occurred, both in patients without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis.

Query 2: Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip?
Document 2: Our purpose was to determine the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients who have had early operative fixation of fractures of the lower extremity distal to the hip. There is a high incidence of distal thrombosis in patients who have undergone early operative fixation of lower-extremity fractures. The incidence of DVT is higher with proximal extremity fractures than with distal extremity fractures. Most clots are occult and do not progress clinically. Given the high incidence of DVT with femoral and tibial plateau fractures, older age, and longer operating times, anticoagulation prophylaxis may be indicated. Ours was a prospective incidence study. All patients who had had early operative fixation of lower-extremity fractures were eligible (n = 176). Seventy-four were excluded based on specific criteria. The remaining 102 patients underwent lower-extremity venography an average of 9 days after operative fixation of their fractures (range 3-22 days). Eight patients had bilateral lower-extremity fractures. The patients were followed clinically for 6 weeks to identify complications related to venous disease. The overall incidence of clinically occult DVT was 28%. Of the represented fractures, 40% were of the femoral shaft (eight of 20), 43% of the tibial plateau (12 of 28), 22% of the tibial shaft (12 of 54), and 12.5% of the tibial plafond (one of eight). Four of the thrombi were proximal to the popliteal fossa. Four of the patients had clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism while in the hospital. One of them had objective confirmation on further testing. No patient had clinical evidence of pulmonary emboli as an outpatient by follow-up criteria. The incidence of DVT has not been determined for patients with early stabilization of lower-extremity fractures. This study suggests a higher DVT incidence in more proximal fractures, but little risk of embolization. Thrombus formation proximal to the popliteal fossa is rare. Older age, longer operating times, and longer times before fracture fixation all correlate with an increased incidence of DVT.
Summary 2: Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism  was also evaluated in a cohort of 102 unselected patients who underwent operative fixation for lower-limb fractures, excluding patella, ankle, and foot fractures. All underwent venography approximately 9 days after fixation and were followed clinically for 6 weeks. The overall incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 28% (40% with femoral shaft, 43% with tibial plateau, 22% with tibial shaft, and 12% with tibial plafond [distal articular tibia]). Four developed clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism  during hospitalization but only 1 had objective confirmation. None of the patients showed clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism  as outpatients.

Query: Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip?
Document: Deep-vein thrombosis is common after plaster-cast immobilisation for traumatic injury. We did a randomised prospective study of the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with minor injuries treated with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg. A control group (n = 163) received no prophylaxis, the prophylaxis group received low-molecular-weight heparin once daily (n = 176). The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in the prophylaxis group was 0% (one tailed p < 0.006) vs 4.3% in the control group. No severe side-effects of low-molecular-weight heparin were observed. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin once daily is effective in reducing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis in outpatients with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg.
Summary:","An RCT evaluated LMWH (Mono-Embolex, a European LMWH) prophylaxis in 328 outpatients with lower limb injuries, which included fractures, severe contusions, and ligamentous injuries. All were treated nonsurgically with cast immobilization (mean=18.8 days, range=2-72 days) and 176 patients used daily LMWH injections. All underwent Doppler evaluation for leg thromboses after cast removal, and positive results were confirmed with venograms. Overall, there were no DVTs among the LMWH prophylaxis group and 7 DVTs (4.3%) in the group without LMWH prophylaxis (P<.006). Among those with fractures, the untreated DVT rate was 5.9% (vs 0% with LMWH prophylaxis). Those over age 40 who did not use LMWH had a DVT rate of 11.4% (vs 1.7% in younger patients). Without LMWH prophylaxis, casting for more than 10 days approximately doubled the risk of DVT compared with less than 10 days (6.1% vs 3.1%). This study did not report on the anatomic location of DVTs or if they were clinically evident."

Query 1: What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants?
Document 1: Paediatricians are familiar with infants complaining of regurgitation and emesis from gastrooesophageal reflux. These subjects, usually growing satisfactorily and healthy, are affected by ""functional"" or ""symptomatic"" gastrooesophagel reflux and are treated with posture changes and thickened feedings. To evaluate in infants with symptomatic gastrooesophageal reflux the effect of a new formula (Nutrilon AR), containing carob flour/locus bean gum as a thickening agent; both clinical features and oesophageal acid exposure were evaluated. Twenty-four infants (age range: 5-11 months; median age: 8 months; 8 females) presented at our Unit with a history of chronic postprandial regurgitation. During a 24-hour intraoesophageal pH test a traditional formula thickened with rice flour at a concentration of 5% was alternated with the formula Nutrilon AR; thereafter infants were randomly allocated to receive, for two weeks, either a traditional thickened formula or the new formula, in addition to posture changes. Intraoesophageal acid exposure was significantly lower in the periods following the new formula than after traditional formula; at the end of the treatment period patients receiving the new formula had a more significant decrease of both symptomatic score and number of episodes of emesis than patients on traditional formula. The new available formula, with the characteristics of a thickened meal, is better than a formula, traditionally thickened with added rice flour, in the conservative treatment of infants with symptomatic gastrooesophageal reflux.
Summary 1: An uncontrolled, comparative trial of carob bean gum vs rice cereal suggested superiority of carob bean gum as a thickener, although both treatments yielded improvement.

Document 2: To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in treating irritable infants with gastroesophageal reflux and/or esophagitis. Irritable infants (n=30) 3 to 12 months of age met the entry criteria of esophageal acid exposure >5% (n=22) and/or abnormal esophageal histology (n=15). They completed a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of omeprazole. Cry/fuss diary (minutes/24 hours) and a visual analogue scale of infant irritability as judged by parental impression were obtained at baseline and the end of each 2-week treatment period. The reflux index fell significantly during omeprazole treatment compared with placebo (-8.9%+/-5.6%, -1.9%+/-2.0%, P<.001). Cry/fuss time decreased from baseline (267+/-119), regardless of treatment sequence (period 1, 203+/-99, P<.04; period 2, 188+/-121, P<.008). Visual analogue score decreased from baseline to period 2 (6.8+/-1.6, 4.8+/-2.9, P=.008). There was no significant difference for both outcome measures while taking either omeprazole or placebo. Compared with placebo, omeprazole significantly reduced esophageal acid exposure but not irritability. Irritability improved with time, regardless of treatment.
Summary 2: A small randomized controlled trials of omeprazole shows significant improvement in reflux index measured by pH probe. However, the study resulted in no differences in ""cry-fuss time"" between treatment groups.

Query: What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants?
Document: To assess the effect of thickening of feedings on gastroesophageal reflux and gastric emptying, 20 infants were examined with technetium scintigraphy and detailed behavioral observation after each of a pair of feedings, one with radiolabeled infant formula alone and the other with radiolabeled formula thickened with dry rice cereal. The thickened and unthickened meals were followed by similar amounts of scintigraphically demonstrated gastroesophageal reflux. However, the number of episodes of emesis (1.2 +/- 0.7 vs 3.9 +/- 0.9 per 90 minutes postprandial), the percent of gastric emptying at 30 minutes (17.8% +/- 2.7% vs 22.4% +/- 2.4%), the time spent crying (11.7 +/- 3.1 minutes vs 17.6 +/- 3.8 minutes per 90 minutes), and the total time spent awake (45.2 +/- 5.9 minutes vs 53.1 +/- 4.9 minutes per 90 minutes) were significantly less after the thickened feedings. Because thickening of infant feedings increases the caloric density, decreases emesis, decreases crying time, and increases sleep time in the postprandial period, it is likely to be beneficial in the treatment of infants with gastroesophageal reflux associated with failure to thrive.
Summary:","In 1 RCT, formula thickened with rice cereal decreased emesis episodes."

Query 1: What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants?
Document 1: The effect of metoclopramide on gastroesophageal reflux was studied in 30 infants less than 1 year of age. Gastroesophageal reflux was documented in all infants by extended pH monitoring before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg or placebo four times a day, 1/2 hour before feeding for 1 week, followed by the alternate regimen for 1 week. The infants were reevaluated with extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy after 4 to 7 days of each treatment. A symptom score was derived by determining the average number of occurrences of all symptoms recorded daily by parents on a symptom checklist during pretreatment, placebo, and metoclopramide treatment periods. There was a difference between pretreatment evaluation and placebo periods with respect to daily symptom scores (p less than 0.005), reflecting a significant placebo response. However, no difference in scintigraphic study was found between placebo and metoclopramide periods. A significant difference between placebo and metoclopramide periods was noted in the percentage of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0 (p less than 0.001). However, although metoclopramide decreased the proportion of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0, pH remained less than 4.0 for more than 5% of the time in most patients. Substratification of the total group into infants younger and older than 3 months revealed that older infants had greater average daily weight gain during the metoclopramide treatment period (34.3 gm/day) than in the placebo treatment period (6.6 gm/day, p = 0.05). We conclude that metoclopramide in the dosage 0.1 mg/kg four times daily reduces reflux in infants and may be useful for infants with poor weight gain and other serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux.
Summary 1: A small randomized controlled trials of metoclopramide shows significant improvement in reflux index measured by pH probe. However, metoclopramide yielded no improvement in symptom counts.

Query: What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants?
Document: To determine whether head-elevated prone positioning is better than flat prone positioning for infants with gastroesophageal reflux, we studied 100 babies less than 6 months of age who were being examined for reflux with an intraluminal esophageal pH probe while the babies were in each of the two positions, with the use of a crossover design protocol. During both a 2-hour postprandial period and a fasting period, pH probe measurements in each position included (1) minutes with pH less than 4, (2) number of episodes with pH less than 4, (3) mean duration of such episodes, (4) number of such episodes longer than 5 minutes, and (5) the duration of the longest episode. Significant reductions with head elevation were found for only two of these 10 values: the frequency of reflux episodes postprandially (7.5 +/- 0.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.5 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.05) and the frequency of episodes longer than 5 minutes postprandially (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.005). There was no significant reduction in the total duration of postprandial reflux nor in any measure of reflux during the fasting period. The 90 infants in whom an abnormal degree of gastroesophageal reflux was documented had no significant differences between flat prone and head-elevated prone position for any of the 10 pH probe measurements. Head-elevated prone positioning is probably not worth the extra effort required to maintain it.
Summary:",Prone positioning is no longer recommended due to the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

Query 1: How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations?
Document 1: Most lacerations and surgical incisions are closed with sutures or staples. Octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (OCA) was recently approved for use in the United States. We compared the cosmetic appearance of lacerations and incisions repaired with OCA versus standard wound closure methods (SWC). A multicenter randomized clinical trial including patients with simple lacerations or surgical incisions was conducted at 10 clinical sites. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with OCA or SWC. Follow-up was performed at 1 week and at 3 months to determine infection rates and cosmetic outcome. Eight hundred fourteen patients with 924 wounds (383 traumatic lacerations, 235 excisions of skin lesions or scar revisions, 208 minimally invasive surgeries, and 98 general surgical procedures) were enrolled. Groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Wound closure with OCA was faster than with SWC (2.9 vs 5.2 minutes, P <.001). At 1 week infection rates were similar (OCA, 2.1% vs SWC, 0.7%; P =.09) and fewer OCA wounds were erythematous (18% vs 36%, P <.001). There were no differences in wound dehiscence rates (OCA, 1.6% vs SWC, 0.9%; P =.35). At 3 months there was no difference in the percent of wounds with optimal appearance (OCA, 82% vs SWC, 83%; P =.67). Repair of traumatic lacerations and surgical incisions with OCA is faster than with SWC, and cosmetic outcome is similar at 3 months.
Summary 1: A multicenter, randomized trial studied 924 wounds (383 traumatic, 541 surgical) and reported no difference in cosmetic appearance upon grading by both a clinician and the patients themselves.

Query 2: How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations?
Document 2: Tissue adhesives have been used for many years to close simple lacerations as an alternative to standard wound closure (sutures, staples, adhesive strips). They offer many potential advantages over standard wound closure, including ease of use, decrease in pain and time to apply, as well as not requiring a follow-up visit for removal. Many studies have compared tissue adhesives and standard wound closure to determine the cosmetic outcome as well as these other secondary outcomes in their respective study populations. However, due to the wide variation in study parameters, there are no generalisable, definitive answers about the effectiveness of tissue adhesives. No study has been adequately powered to assess differences in complications, which are rare. To summarize the best available evidence for the effect of tissue adhesives in the management of traumatic lacerations in children and adults. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CD ROM 2001 Issue 4), the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Trials Register (Nov 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 1, 2001), and EMBASE (1988 to Sept 1, 2001) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the citations of selected studies, and we contacted relevant authors and manufacturers of tissue adhesives to inquire about other published and unpublished trials. We included RCTs comparing tissue adhesives versus standard wound closure or tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive for acute, linear, low tension, traumatic lacerations in an emergency or primary care setting. Trials evaluating tissue adhesives for surgical incisions or other types of wounds were not considered. Data from eligible studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Two reviewers independently assessed masked copies for quality. Outcomes of cosmesis (subgroups of age, wound location and need for deep sutures), pain, procedure time, ease of use and complications were analysed separately for two comparisons: 1) tissue adhesive versus standard wound care; and 2) tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive. Eight studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound care. No significant difference was found for cosmesis at any of the time points examined, using either Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) or Wound Evaluation Score (WES). Data were only available for subgroup analysis for age; no significant differences were found. Pain scores (Parent VAS WMD -15.7 mm; 95% CI -21.9, -9.5) and procedure time (WMD -5.6 minutes; 95% CI -8.2, -3.1) significantly favoured tissue adhesives. No studies reported on ease of use. Small but statistically significant risk differences were found for dehiscence (favouring standard wound care NNH 25 95% CI 14, 100) and erythema (favouring tissue adhesive NNH 8 95% CI 4, 100). Other complications were not significantly different between treatment groups. Only one study was identified that compared two tissue adhesives (butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl TM) versus octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM)) for pediatric facial lacerations. No significant difference was found for cosmesis using CVAS at 1-3 months, or using WES at 5-14 days and 1-3 months. Similarly, no significant difference was found in pain, procedure time or complications. Results for ease of use were incomplete as reported. Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. There is no significant difference in cosmetic outcome between tissue adhesives and standard wound closure, or between different tissue adhesives. They offer the benefit of decreased procedure time and less pain, compared to standard wound closure. A small but statistically significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives must be considered when choosing the closure method (NNH 25).
Summary 2: A Cochrane review found 10 studies, which included 970 patients in the emergency-room setting. Review of these articles found no significant difference in cosmetic appearance between tissue adhesive closure and standard suture closure with a 3-month follow-up period in acute, linear wounds under low tension. Wound erythema (number needed to treat [NNT]=10) and dehiscence rates (NNT=25) were lower for tissue adhesives. In the 6 studies that reported time data, treatment with tissue adhesive took 4.7 fewer minutes. In all 6 studies that reported patients' perception of pain, pain was significantly less with tissue adhesive (weighted mean difference=13.7 mm [on 100-mm scale]; 95% confidence interval [CI], -20.0 to -6.9).

Query: How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations?
Document: Octylcyanoacrylate is a medical grade topical tissue adhesive that has been approved for closing surgical incisions and traumatic lacerations. We reviewed animal and human studies that evaluated its use for a variety of surgical indications and specialties. We also performed a meta-analysis of all clinical trials using octylcyanoacrylate. Animal and human studies published in peer-reviewed articles as well as published abstracts. A search of Medline was performed using the MESH terms: tissue adhesives, cyanoacrylates, and octylcyanoacrylate. The current review and metanalysis demonstrate that octylcyanoacrylate can be used successfully in a wide variety of clinical and surgical settings for multiple types of wounds covering most of the surface of the human body. Prior knowledge of the limitations and technical aspects specific to wound closure with octylcyanoacrylate as well as appropriate wound selection and preparation will help ensure optimal results.
Summary:",Pain outcomes in the studies showed that closure with tissue adhesive was less painful due to the lack of a need for anesthesia.

Query 1: How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention?
Document 1: Due to the distinctive features of the hospital emergency department and its patients, emergency physicians confront special challenges in respecting patient rights to informed consent to treatment. After a brief review of the doctrine of informed consent and of its significance in the emergency department, this article will examine three specific challenges for informed consent and refusal of treatment in emergency medicine: (1) assessing patient decision-making capacity, (2) performing procedures on the newly dead, and (3) making treatment decisions for patients in legal custody.
Summary 1: The law of informed consent defines the right to informed refusal. Thus, each case must establish: 1) that the patient or decision maker is competent, 2) that the decision is voluntary, and 3) that the physician disclosed the risks of the choice to the patient, including a discussion of risks and alternatives to treatment, and potential consequences of treatment refusal, including jeopardy to health or life.
##
Query 2: How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention?
Document 2: Patients' thoughts, feelings and desires are communicated in a variety of ways, and require sympathetic, critical interpretation. Patients need clear, evidence-based medical information so that they can make their own decisions about whether to consent to or refuse medical treatment. Treatment refusal may provide an opportunity to introduce patients to advance care planning. Unconscious motivations in doctors may obstruct good clinical decision-making. Although respect for the patient's responsibility to make healthcare decisions should be a condition of the clinical relationship, healthcare decision-making is a collaborative process.
Summary 2: The reasons for the refusal should be explored.
##
Query: How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention?
Document: Clearly, a multitude of potential consent problems can exist for the emergency physician. It is difficult at times to balance the concepts of patient autonomy with the desire to provide optimal medical care. Experienced emergency physicians should be able to individualize the type of consent needed in a particular situation, based on a clinical evaluation of the case. Some general principles apply, but no strict rules can guide the physician in every case. Documentation of consent and refusal of treatment are critical for quality of patient care and legal liability reasons. Principles of what is good, ""appropriate"" legal consent usually follow from good medical care and strict concern for the patient's health and rights.
Summary:","In addition to the discussion with the patient, the medical record should describe any involvement of family or other third parties. If imminently or potentially serious consequences are likely to result from patient refusal, health care providers might consider having the refusal signed and witnessed."

Query 1: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document 1: In a controlled, prospective, double-blind study, the incidence of accurate injection of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendon compartments was defined and correlated with clinical relief of de Quervain's tendinitis. X-ray dye was included with steroid and lidocaine injections for 19 patients; dye location was immediately checked by 1 radiologist blinded to the clinical results. Dye was confirmed to be within the first dorsal compartment in 16 of 19 cases. There was relief of symptoms in 11 of 19 patients. Four of 5 patients with dye in both the APL and EPB tendon compartments, experienced relief of symptoms, while all 3 with dye in neither compartment experienced no relief. This suggests that accurate injection of steroids is required for relief of de Quervain's tendinitis. The EPB compartment was often missed (13/19 cases), possibly because it was separate or of small size and deep location. This may be a factor in failed injections, just as surgery can fail if a separate EPB compartment is not released.
Summary 1: In 1 small, controlled, prospective, double-blinded study, the authors attempted to correlate clinical relief of de Quervain's tenosynovitis with accuracy of injection into the first dorsal compartment. The researchers enrolled 19 patients. The same hand surgeon injected 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, 1 cc betamethasone, and 1 cc Omnipaque 300 dye into the abductor pollicis longus sheath and then attempted, with ulnar deviation of the needle, to fill the extensor pollicis brevis sheath. Patients were followed-up at 1 month and 3 months postinjection. Success-defined as a negative Finkelstein's test, absence of pain, and normal activities of daily living-was noted in 11 of 19 patients at 3 months. In a radiographic check, 4 of 5 of the patients with dye in both compartments were asymptomatic, while the 3 who had no dye in either compartment remained symptomatic. This suggests that the location of injection may be important in de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

Query 2: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document 2: This retrospective study compares two methods used to treat de Quervain's disease: splintage with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid injection. Patients were separated into three groups based on symptom severity: group I-minimal, group II-mild, and group III-moderate or severe. Three hundred and nineteen wrists in 300 patients were followed from one to six years. Fifteen of 17 patients with minimal symptoms were relieved with splintage and NSAIDs. However, only seven of 20 in Group II and two of eight in Group III treated similarly were relieved. Of the 249 patients in Group III treated with injections, 76% were completely relieved, 7% were improved, and 4% were not improved. We conclude that classification of patients' with de Quervain's disease based on their pre-treatment symptoms may assist surgeons in selecting the most efficacious treatment and in providing prognostic information to their patients.
Summary 2: A retrospective study compared steroid injection with splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Researchers stratified subjects into minimal, mild, or moderate-to-severe, based on their severity of disease and limitation on their activities of daily living. Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Of those cases treated with splinting and NSAIDs, 15 of 17 in the minimal group had resolution of symptoms, but only 4 of 20 in the mild group and 2 of 8 in the moderate-to-severe group had symptoms resolve. The injection group obtained better results, with 100% of cases in the minimal and mild groups resolving and 76% of those in the more severe group resolving completely, with an additional 7% reporting improvement.

Query: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document: Ninety-five patients with 107 trigger digits were divided into 2 groups and studied prospectively to evaluate steroid injection placement and efficacy. In 1 group, an attempt was made to deliver 1 injection into the tendon sheath at the A1 pulley. In the other group, 1 injection infiltrated the subcutaneous tissues overlying the A1 pulley. Radiopaque dye provided contrast to the injection medium, and postinjection x-rays identified the true delivery site of the steroid solution. Of the 52 digits into which intrasheath injection was attempted, 19 digits (37%) received all the injection within the sheath, 24 (46%) received medication into both the sheath and the subcutaneous tissues, and 9 (17%) received no medication within the tendon sheath. The results were analyzed to determine whether injection placement influences the efficacy of steroid injection. The confirmed all-sheath injection group exhibited a 47% good response, the mixed sheath and subcutaneous group had a 50% good response, and the all-subcutaneous group had a 70% good response. The results of this study suggest that true intrasheath injection offers no apparent advantage over subcutaneous injection in the treatment of trigger digits.
Summary:","In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 107 patients with flexor tenosynovitis were injected with 1 cc of betamethasone, 0.5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 0.5 cc of radio opaque dye. Some patients got their injections in the tendon sheath at the A1 pulley site, others got their injections in the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the pulley, and a third group got injections in both sites. Patients graded their relief subjectively as either good (total alleviation of symptoms), fair (lasting improvement), or poor (only transient improvement or none at all). Those who received an intrasheath injection reported good results 47% of the time at 2 weeks follow-up, compared with 70% and 50% for patients in the subcutaneous and mixed groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, suggesting that the exact location of injection may not be important."

Document 1: Patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) are frequently treated with corticosteroid injections, in order to relieve pain and diminish disability. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference tracking. Two independent reviewers selected and assessed the methodological quality of RCTs that included patients with lateral epicondylitis treated with corticosteroid injection(s), and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Standardised mean differences were computed for continuous data and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. Thirteen studies consisting of 15 comparisons were included in the review, evaluating the effects of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo injection (n=2), injection with local anaesthetic (n=5), another conservative treatment (n=5), or another corticosteroid injection (n=3). Almost all studies had poor internal validity scores. For short-term outcomes (<or=6 weeks), statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were found on pain, global improvement and grip strength for corticosteroid injection compared to placebo, local anaesthetic and conservative treatments. For intermediate (6 weeks-6 months) and long-term outcomes (>or=6 months), no statistically significant or clinically relevant results in favour of corticosteroid injections were found. Although the available evidence shows superior short-term effects of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of injections, due to the lack of high quality studies. No beneficial effects were found for intermediate or long-term follow-up. More, better designed, conducted and reported RCTs with intermediate and long-term follow-up are needed.
Summary 1: A subanalysis of 4 studies in another systematic review found corticosteroid injections to be superior to other conservative treatments such as elbow supports, oral NSAIDs, and physiotherapy at 2 to 6 weeks (RR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.70). The positive effects were not maintained at 6 weeks.

Query 2: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document 2: This retrospective study compares two methods used to treat de Quervain's disease: splintage with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid injection. Patients were separated into three groups based on symptom severity: group I-minimal, group II-mild, and group III-moderate or severe. Three hundred and nineteen wrists in 300 patients were followed from one to six years. Fifteen of 17 patients with minimal symptoms were relieved with splintage and NSAIDs. However, only seven of 20 in Group II and two of eight in Group III treated similarly were relieved. Of the 249 patients in Group III treated with injections, 76% were completely relieved, 7% were improved, and 4% were not improved. We conclude that classification of patients' with de Quervain's disease based on their pre-treatment symptoms may assist surgeons in selecting the most efficacious treatment and in providing prognostic information to their patients.
Summary 2: A retrospective study compared steroid injection with splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Researchers stratified subjects into minimal, mild, or moderate-to-severe, based on their severity of disease and limitation on their activities of daily living. Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Of those cases treated with splinting and NSAIDs, 15 of 17 in the minimal group had resolution of symptoms, but only 4 of 20 in the mild group and 2 of 8 in the moderate-to-severe group had symptoms resolve. The injection group obtained better results, with 100% of cases in the minimal and mild groups resolving and 76% of those in the more severe group resolving completely, with an additional 7% reporting improvement.

Query: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document: There have been many approaches described to treat de Quervain's tenosynovitis, but no definite consensus emerges in the literature. We conducted a pooled quantitative literature evaluation to review the therapeutic studies in the English language to determine the various reported cure rates. All citations in the MEDLINE and Ovid databases that addressed de Quervain's tenosynovitis were independently reviewed. Appropriate studies from the bibliographies of these articles were then obtained. Of the 35 articles on de Quervain's temosynovitis that were found in the modern literature, only seven allowed for comparison among potentially effective treatments. Studies were included if they evaluated or compared treatment options among patients and had defined criteria for diagnosis and successful treatment. These seven studies were descriptive, not comparative. In other words, each study reported the proportion of successful outcomes with different treatments, without a comparison to a specified control group. Four hundred fifty-nine wrists were subjected to one of several therapeutic modalities. There was an 83% cure rate with injection alone. This rate was much higher than any other therapeutic modality (61% for injection and splint, 14% for splint alone, 0% for rest or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). It seems that injection alone is the best therapeutic approach to de Quervain's tenosynovitis.
Summary:","A pooled quantitative literature search concerning the treatment of de Quervain's tenosynovitis compared 7 studies (a total of 459 wrists) with identical diagnostic and success criteria. Average follow-up was 9.6 months (range, 1 week to 7 years). There were no control groups in the studies, and none of the studies were randomized. Of the 226 cases treated with steroid injection alone, 83% were cured, though 30 of these needed a second injection. Sixty-one percent of those treated with injection and splint were cured, while 14% treated with splint alone reported cure."

Query 1: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document 1: This retrospective study aimed to determine why the incidence of strangulated hernias in adults remains high. Seventy-nine patients presented with clinical evidence of hernia strangulation which required urgent surgery during the period 1979-87. Forty-six patients (58 per cent) had noted a hernia present for at least 1 month before strangulation: 18 (23 per cent) had not reported it to their family doctor, 19 (24 per cent) were known by family practitioners or non-surgical medical personnel to have a hernia but had not been referred for surgical opinion, and nine (11 per cent) had been previously assessed surgically with a view to elective repair. Of these nine, five were considered unfit, three were on waiting lists for operation and one had refused surgery. Thirty-two patients (40 per cent) presented primarily with strangulation within days of developing a hernia. The duration of hernia before strangulation in one patient was unknown. Although an unavoidable number of patients will continue to present with strangulation within days of developing a hernia, the overall incidence could be significantly reduced by greater public awareness of the risks of hernia strangulation and by a policy of immediate patient referral and prompt elective repair.
Summary 1: Another retrospective study found the need for emergent repair peaked for patients 70 to 80 years of age.

Query 2: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document 2: Despite universal acceptance of the value of elective hernia repair, many patients present with incarceration or strangulation, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We reviewed 147 patients who underwent emergency surgery for incarcerated groin hernias during a 10-year period in order to analyze the presentation and outcome in our practice. Median age of the patients was 70 years. There were 77 men and 70 women. Femoral hernias were seen in 77 patients and inguinal hernias in 70. Coexisting diseases were found in 82 cases (55.8%). Bowel resection was required in 19 patients (12.9%). The overall and major morbidity rates were 41.5% and 9.6%, respectively. The mortality rate was 3.4%. Longer duration of symptoms, late hospitalization, concomitant diseases, and high ASA class were found to be significant factors linked with unfavorable outcomes. Because of high morbidity and mortality associated with incarceration, elective repair of groin hernias should be done whenever possible.
Summary 2: A retrospective study of 70 patients with incarcerated inguinal hernias presenting for emergency surgery in Northern Spain reported a cumulative 2.8% probability of strangulation at 3 months, rising to 4.5% after 2 years. This study did not include patients presenting for elective repair of hernias, and therefore it likely overestimated the rate of strangulation among patients in a primary care setting.

Query: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document: Emergency hernia repairs comprise one of the most common procedures performed in elderly patients and also carry a high risk of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the factors that might have an influence on the outcome of emergency hernia repairs in elderly patients. A review was made of 189 (120 male and 69 female) patients aged more than 65 years who underwent emergency hernia repair between December 1996 and January 2001 at the surgical emergency unit of our hospital. The patients' ages ranged from 65 to 100 years (mean 72.1). Concomitant diseases were present in 86 (45.5%) patients. Of 189 incarcerated hernias, there were 145 (76.7%) bowel obstructions and 91(48%) strangulations. Necrotic bowel was resected in 36(19%) patients. While overall mortality was 5%, it was found to be 19.4% after bowel resection. Major complications were observed in 48 (25%) patients. Mortality and morbidity were clearly linked with bowel resection. Coexisting cardiopulmonary diseases, misdiagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and late admission were also found to be responsible for unfavorable outcomes. In elderly patients with external hernias early elective surgery should be preferred, and local anesthesia might be the best in order to avoid the increased risks of emergency hernia repairs.
Summary:","A Turkish study of patients needing emergent surgical repair found morbidity to be significantly related to American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, with mortality rates of 3% and 14% for ASA class III and IV patients, respectively. This was a retrospective chart review that analyzed factors responsible for unfavorable outcomes; it found increased complications in hernia patients who had coexisting disease, hernias of longer duration, as well as higher ASA class. This study found the need for emergent repair peaked for patients 70 to 80 years of age."

Query 1: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document 1: Many patients with an inguinal hernia are asymptomatic or have little in the way of symptoms from their hernia. Repair is often associated with long-term chronic pain and has a recurrence rate of 5% to 10%. Our aim was to compare operation with a wait-and-see policy in patients with an asymptomatic hernia. A total of 160 male patients 55 years or older were randomly assigned to observation or operation. Patients were assessed clinically and sent questionnaires at 6 months and 1 year. The primary endpoint was pain and general health status at 12 months; other outcome measures included costs to the health service and the rate of operation for a new symptom or complication. At 12 months, there were no significant differences between the randomized groups of observation or operation, in visual analogue pain scores at rest, 3.7 mm versus 5.2 mm (mean difference, -1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.8 to 1.6, P = 0.34), or on moving, 7.6 mm versus 5.7 mm (mean difference, -1.9; 95% CI, -6.1 to 2.4, P = 0.39). Also, the number of patients 29 versus 24 (difference in proportion, 8%; 95% CI, -7% to 23%, P = 0.31), who recorded pain on moving and the number taking regular analgesia, 9 versus 17 (difference in proportion, -10%; 95% CI, -21% to 2%, P = 0.14) was similar. At 6 months, there were significant improvements in most of the dimensions of the SF-36 for the operation group, while at 12 months although the trend remained the same the differences were only significant for change in health (mean difference, 7.3; 95% CI, 0.4 to 14.3, P = 0.039). The rate of crossover from observation to operation 23 patients at a median follow-up of 574 days was higher than predicted. The observation group also suffered 3 serious hernia-related adverse events compared with none in the operation group. Repair of an asymptomatic inguinal hernia does not affect the rate of long-term chronic pain and may be beneficial to patients in improving overall health and reducing potentially serious morbidity.
Summary 1: The mean follow-up time in a trial which had 80 control group participants, was 1.6 years; 29% of patients eventually crossed over for repair.

Query 2: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document 2: Complications that develop in groin hernias, such as irreducibility and obstruction, with or without strangulation may make an easily treatable condition a life-threatening one. Identification of risk factors that may predict development would help place the patient in a high-risk group. Priority admission and early elective surgery for such a patient would avoid significant mortality and morbidity. This is a 10-year combined prospective and retrospective study of children and adults. Records of complicated groin hernias were identified from July 1985 to July 1995 from the outpatient department and available inpatient medical records. The same number of controls of simple uncomplicated hernias were then chosen using random number tables from among the large number belonging to the same time period. These two groups were then compared and analysed using statistical methods for age, sex, side of hernia, site of hernia (inguinal/femoral), duration of hernia, length of the waiting list for elective surgery, and contents of the hernial sac along with some other parameters to identify patients with high-risk factors. Age was found to be a significant risk factor and predicted complications in both elderly adults and very young children. Sex of the patient (male) and side of hernia (right) were significant risk factors in children only. Site of hernia was an important risk factor and adults with femoral hernia were most likely to experience complications. Duration of hernia for less than a year proved to be the most important risk factor for both children and adults. The majority of patients with complicated hernias had not presented earlier in the outpatient department, which implies that most hernias that become complicated do so within a very short time before patient referral. Mortality was high in patients with coexisting diseases, while morbidity was affected by viability of contents of the hernial sac which in turn was directly affected by duration of irreducibility or delay in presentation. The risk factors useful in predicting complications in an adult patient with groin hernia were age (older age group), duration of hernia (short duration), type of hernia (femoral more than inguinal) and coexisting medical illness. In children, the risk factors were age (very young), gender (male), short duration of hernia and side (right side).
Summary 2: A case-control study found that the risk of strangulation was higher for hernias of shorter duration.

Query: What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia?
Document: It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated on electively in order to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with incarceration and small bowel obstruction. The present study reassesses the indication for surgery in asymptomatic inguinal hernia patients. We analyzed profiles, separately, for elective and emergency inguinal herniorrhaphies and compared the morbidity and mortality rates. Two hundred randomly selected elective hernia repairs were compared with 67 incarcerated cases. Postoperative complications were more common following emergency (23.9%) than elective repair (10.5%); however, in both groups, minor complications predominated. The mortality rate in the incarcerated group (6%) was clearly linked with a high preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. A bowel resection rate of 4.5% was found in the incarcerated cases, which was not correlated with mortality. Patients with asymptomatic inguinal hernia and unfavorable medical conditions should be recommended an elective repair, preferably under local anesthesia, to avoid the high mortality associated with an emergency operation.
Summary:","A retrospective study from Israel also showed that patients who underwent emergency repair were older, had a longer history of herniation than those undergoing elective repair, and had higher ASA scores."

Query 1: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 1: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 1: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query 2: What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL?
Document 2: The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis that compares the reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with high-dose statin therapy versus standard dosing. Debate exists regarding the merit of more intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy as compared with standard-dose therapy. We searched PubMed and article references for randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard-dose statin therapy enrolling more than 1,000 patients with either stable coronary heart disease or acute coronary syndromes. Four trials were identified: the TNT (Treating to New Targets) and the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering) trials involved patients with stable cardiovascular disease, and the PROVE IT-TIMI-22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-22) and A-to-Z (Aggrastat-to-Zocor) trials involved patients with acute coronary syndromes. We carried out a meta-analysis of the relative odds on the basis of a fixed-effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method for the major outcomes of death and cardiovascular events. A total of 27,548 patients were enrolled in the 4 large trials. The combined analysis yielded a significant 16% odds reduction in coronary death or myocardial infarction (p < 0.00001), as well as a significant 16% odds reduction of coronary death or any cardiovascular event (p < 0.00001). No difference was observed in total or non-cardiovascular mortality, but a trend toward decreased cardiovascular mortality (odds reduction 12%, p = 0.054) was observed. Intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy provides a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly non-fatal cardiovascular events.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis concluded that intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy confers a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly nonfatal cardiovascular events.

Query: What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an LDL <70 mg/dL?
Document: This study sought to determine whether statins reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk more than other interventions that also primarily lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, vascular, and other non-LDL-C-lowering effects. It is unclear whether these pleiotropic effects contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction beyond that expected from LDL-C reduction alone. Trials published in English language journals were retrieved by searching Medline (1966 to October 2004), bibliographies, and the author's reference files. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of interventions to primarily lower LDL-C of three or more years' duration in which clinical disease or death were primary outcomes were used. Information on sample size, treatment type and duration, participant characteristics at baseline, reduction in lipids, and outcome was independently abstracted by two authors (J.R. and N.M.) using a standardized protocol. Data from 5 diet, 3 bile acid sequestrant, 1 surgery, and 10 statin trials, with 81,859 participants, were included in the CHD meta-regression analysis. The regression lines for non-statin and statin trials were similar and consistent with a one-to-one relationship between LDL-C lowering and CHD and stroke reduction over five years of treatment. The pleiotropic effects of statins do not seem to contribute an additional cardiovascular risk reduction benefit beyond that expected from the degree of LDL-C lowering observed in other trials that primarily lowered LDL-C.
Summary:","A 19-trial meta-regression analysis (81,859 patients with stable CHD) demonstrated that each 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol corresponded to a 1% decrease in risk for CHD. This result held true regardless of different approaches to treatment, which included diet, bile-acid sequestrant, statins, or ileal bypass surgery."

Query 1: Do statins reduce the risk of stroke?
Document 1: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
Summary 1: The Heart Protection Study showed no difference in the number of hemorrhagic strokes between treatment and placebo groups. There were 3500 subjects with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dL; lowering low density lipoprotein to 65 mg/dL reduced major vascular event risk by about 25%.
##
Query 2: What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL?
Document 2: Previous trials have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below currently recommended levels is beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy and received either 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin per day. Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. The mean LDL cholesterol levels were 77 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin and 101 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin. The incidence of persistent elevations in liver aminotransferase levels was 0.2 percent in the group given 10 mg of atorvastatin and 1.2 percent in the group given 80 mg of atorvastatin (P<0.001). A primary event occurred in 434 patients (8.7 percent) receiving 80 mg of atorvastatin, as compared with 548 patients (10.9 percent) receiving 10 mg of atorvastatin, representing an absolute reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events of 2.2 percent and a 22 percent relative reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.89; P<0.001). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in overall mortality. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD provides significant clinical benefit beyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day. This occurred with a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.
Summary 2: The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study showed that in patients with stable CHD, intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg daily delivered significant clinical benefit beyond that provided by atorvastatin 10 mg daily. The mean low density lipoprotein achieved in treating to new targets was 77 mg/dL on 80 mg atorvastatin, compared with 101 mg/dL on 10 mg. Patients with diabetes who took 80 mg had a 2.26% absolute risk reduction for major cardiovascular events (number needed to treat=43). Secondary outcomes-including all cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular events, and congestive heart failure with hospitalization-also improved on 80 mg atorvastatin. Although this study enrolled a total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD, it was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in overall mortality between the 2 groups. While it is clear that patients in the 80-mg group had better outcomes than patients in the lower-dose group, the exact role of low density lipoprotein lowering cannot be easily separated from other potentially beneficial effects of the higher dose of atorvastatin.

Query: What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an LDL <70 mg/dL?
Document: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
Summary:","In the Heart Protection Study, patients with CHD, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomized to 40 mg simvastatin or placebo. Simvastatin reduced relative risk of CHD-regardless of baseline LDL-even in patients with a baseline LDL <116 mg/dL. Further analysis showed that among the many types of high-risk patients, 5 years of simvastatin at 40 mg daily would prevent about 70 to 100 people in 1000 from suffering at least 1 major vascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or the need for revascularization). Interestingly, patients with relatively smaller reductions in LDL (those in the lowest third) showed the same decrease in CHD events as patients in the highest third-although the overall difference in LDL wasn't large."

Query 1: Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults?
Document 1: Behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common. To compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group. Two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% African American, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). Enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred August 2003-July 2004 and randomization, February-December 2004. Data collection was completed in June 2007. After the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. Main Outcome Changes in weight from randomization. Mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. During the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. After randomization, weight regain occurred. Participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; P = .001). At 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% CI, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; P = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; P = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; P = .04). At 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% CI -2.1 to -0.3; P = .008). Effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. Overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight. The majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. Monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00054925.
Summary 1: In one study, 1032 overweight or obese adults with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia who completed a weight-loss program were randomly assigned to receive monthly personal contact, unlimited access to a Web-based intervention, or a self-directed control group. At 30 months, participants in the personal contact group had regained less weight than the Web-based or control groups (4.0, 5.1, and 5.5 kg, respectively; P<.01).

Query 2: Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults?
Document 2: In the past, interventions aimed at reducing obesity have mainly targeted at weight loss treatment in obese adults, with limited long-term effects. With the increasing number of people being obese and being at risk for obesity, there has been a shift in focus towards prevention of obesity. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on the efficacy of obesity prevention interventions in adults in order to identify effective interventions and intervention elements. Pubmed, OVID, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 1996 to June 2006. Interventions aimed at primary prevention of weight gain among adults achieved by focusing on dietary intake, physical activity or the combination of both were included. The outcome measure had to be difference in change in body mass index or body weight between the intervention and the control groups. Nine studies were included, five long-term studies (at least 1 year) and four short-term (3 months to 1 year). Seven studies evaluated an intervention that focused on a combination of diet and physical activity to prevent weight gain, one on diet only and one on physical activity only. One dietary intervention (long-term), and three combined dietary and physical activity interventions (one long-term and two short-term) produced significantly positive results at end of follow-up. The two long-term, effective interventions consisted of intensive and long-term intervention implementation, including groups sessions designed to promote behavioural changes. The current evidence of efficacy of obesity prevention interventions is based on a very small number of studies. Some studies showed a positive impact on body mass index or weight status, but there was too much heterogeneity in terms of study design, theoretical underpinning and target population to draw firm conclusions about which intervention approaches are more effective than others. More research is urgently needed to extend the body of evidence.
Summary 2: A systematic review of obesity prevention studies found 9 RCTs demonstrating that dietary and physical activity interventions can prevent weight gain, but lacking sufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of program.

Query 1: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 1: The association between obesity and morbidity resulting from chronic diseases is well known. This systematic review addresses studies of the role of rapid growth in infancy and childhood as possible determinants of overweight and obesity later in the life course. We reviewed MEDLINE for studies reporting on growth in infancy and childhood, as well as measures of weight or adiposity in later childhood, adolescence or adulthood. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed using the criteria suggested by Downs and Black. Sixteen articles that fulfilled review criteria were located. There was wide variability in the indicators used for defining rapid growth as well as overweight or obesity. The age range in which weight or adiposity was measured ranged from 3 to 70 years. In spite of differences in definitions used, 13 articles that reported on early rapid growth found significant associations with later overweight or adiposity. Efforts should be made to standardize the definition of rapid growth, as well as that of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. The most frequent definition for rapid growth in this review was a Z-score change greater than 0.67 in weight for age between two different ages in childhood. Regarding obesity, the definition proposed by the International Obesity Task Force also appears to be most appropriate. The present results indicate that early growth is indeed associated with the prevalence of obesity later in the life course.
Summary 1: One descriptive meta-analysis reported that 13 of 15 studies found a positive association between weight gain in the first year of life and overweight later in childhood, although overall odds ratio and relative risk were not reported.

Query 2: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 2: To investigate the relationship between breast-feeding and obesity in childhood. Systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies) comparing early feeding-mode and adjusting for potential confounding factors. Electronic databases were searched and reference lists of relevant articles were checked. Calculations of pooled estimates were conducted in fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was tested by Q-test. Publication bias was assessed from funnel plots and by a linear regression method. Odds ratio (OR) for obesity in childhood defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles. Nine studies with more than 69,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that breast-feeding reduced the risk of obesity in childhood significantly. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.78, 95% CI (0.71, 0.85) in the fixed model. The assumption of homogeneity of results of the included studies could not be refuted (Q-test for heterogeneity, P>0.3), stratified analyses showed no differences regarding different study types, age groups, definition of breast-feeding or obesity and number of confounding factors adjusted for. A dose-dependent effect of breast-feeding duration on the prevalence of obesity was reported in four studies. Funnel plot regression gave no indication of publication bias. Breast-feeding seems to have a small but consistent protective effect against obesity in children.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that 7 showed a significantly lower risk of overweight among children who were breastfed (odds ratio [OR]=0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.85). Four of the studies demonstrated that longer duration of breastfeeding offered greater protection than shorter duration. Two of the 4 studies defined longer duration as more than 6 months, 1 defined it as more than 3 months, and 1 examined breastfeeding for periods of less than 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 2 to 3 months, 4 to 6 months, 7 to 9 months, and longer than 9 months, showing a duration-dependent decrease in risk. The other studies in the meta-analysis evaluated never-breastfed vs ever-breastfed infants.

Query: Are overweight children more likely to be overweight adults?
Document: Overweight and obesity in youth are important public health concerns and are of particular interest because of possible long-term associations with adult weight status and morbidity. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and update evidence concerning persistence of childhood overweight. A computerized bibliographical search--restricted to studies with a prospective or retrospective longitudinal design--was conducted. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies in four dimensions (i) study population and participation rate; (ii) study attrition; (iii) data collection and (iv) data analysis. Conclusions were based on a rating system of three levels of evidence. A total of 25 publications were selected for inclusion in this review. According to a methodological quality assessment, 13 studies were considered to be of high quality. The majority of these high-quality studies were published after 2001, indicating that recently published data, in particular, provide us with reliable information. All included studies consistently report an increased risk of overweight and obese youth becoming overweight adults, suggesting that the likelihood of persistence of overweight into adulthood is moderate for overweight and obese youth. However, predictive values varied considerably. Limiting aspects with respect to generalizability and methodological issues are discussed.
Summary:","A 2008 systematic review found 25 prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that examined the risk of overweight in adulthood based on overweight in childhood or adolescence. Studies had to include at least 1 anthropomorphic measurement before age 18 and at least 1 after age 18. The informativeness and validity of the studies were assessed using a standard evaluation tool. Because the review sought to provide results that could be generalized to large populations, it didn't include studies of specific populations, such as former premature infants. All of the 13 studies judged to be high quality found an elevated RR or odds ratio (OR) for adult obesity among participants who had been overweight as children. The authors didn't calculate a composite measure of effect, but RRs in the individual studies ranged from 1.9 to 10.1. The systematic review considered children (≤12 years) and adolescents (>12 years) separately. Four high-quality studies assessed how many overweight children became overweight adults; 2 high-quality studies examined how many overweight children became obese adults. Overweight children had RRs between 1.9 and 3.6 for being overweight in adulthood compared with average-weight children; 1 study reported an OR of 7.0. One study showed older overweight children to be at greater risk than younger children for overweight in adulthood: children who were overweight at 2 years of age had an RR of 2.7, whereas children who were overweight at 11 years had an RR of 3.6. Obese children had similar results. A study of 4 age cohorts showed that children who were obese at 1 or 2 years of age had an OR of 1.3 for obesity in adulthood compared with average-weight peers. Obese children in the 3- to 5-year-old cohort had an OR of 4.7; obese children in the 6- to 9-year-old cohort had an OR of 8.8; and obese 10- to 14-year-olds had an OR of 22.3. As with children, overweight adolescents had a higher risk of being overweight in adulthood. And the association between older age and higher ORs persisted into adolescence. One study found an OR of 17.5 for adult overweight among youngsters who were overweight at 10 to 14 years of age and an OR of 22.3 for adolescents who were overweight at 15 to 17 years. The systematic review also revealed sex differences. Two studies showed that overweight or obese boys were not only more likely to be overweight in adulthood than their average-weight peers (OR=15.0 in 1 study; RR=9.8 in the other), but also more likely to be overweight later in life than overweight or obese girls. The girls had an OR of 12.0 for adult overweight in 1 study and an RR of 6.8 in the other."

Query 1: How should you further evaluate an adult with a testicular mass?
Document 1: To determine whether there is justification for a policy of conservative management of acute scrotal emergencies, based on the ability to exclude a twisted testicle or the assumption that there is a ""missed torsion' when the duration of symptoms is prolonged. The case notes of 209 consecutive emergency scrotal explorations, carried out in one district general hospital over a 7-year period, were reviewed. The decision to operate was based solely on a clinical diagnosis, with no information from additional radiological investigations. The commonest finding was testicular torsion (39.5%) with an orchidectomy rate of 22%. Only 5% of scrotal torsions occurred in patients < 12 years of age, whereas 26% occurred in those > 20 years of age. In five of 82 cases (6%) of confirmed testicular torsion, the surgeon did not consider this the most likely diagnosis. With a pain duration of < 16 h, 89% of testes were salvaged, but with pain for > 16 h this decreased to 25%. In three cases the testis was viable after pain had been present for > 24 h. In the absence of supportive radiological investigations, a small but significant number of twisted testes will be missed if conservative management is adopted.
Summary 1: In a study of 209 emergency scrotal explorations, clinical exam by general practitioners and surgeons correctly diagnosed only 92.5% and 94% of testicular torsion cases, respectively, compared with the surgical diagnosis. If torsion cannot be reliably excluded, emergent surgical exploration is mandatory.

Query 2: How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion?
Document 2: To compare historical features, physical examination findings, and testicular color Doppler ultrasound in pediatric patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of epididymitis, testicular torsion, or torsion of appendix testis. Ninety patients were included in the study (64 with epididymitis, 13 with testicular torsion, and 13 with torsion of appendix testis). Historical features did not differ among groups except for duration of symptoms. Of 13 patients with testicular torsion all had a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex. When compared with the testicular torsion group, fewer patients with epididymitis had a tender testicle (69%) or an absent cremasteric reflex (14%). 62 (97%) patients with epididymitis had a tender epididymis and 43 (67%) had scrotal erythema/edema. By comparison, 3 (23%) and 5 (38%) patients with testicular torsion had a tender epididymis or scrotal erythema/edema, respectively. Doppler ultrasound showed decreased or absent blood flow in 8 patients, 7 of whom were diagnosed with testicular torsion. Ten out of 13 patients with testicular torsion had a salvageable testicle at the time of surgery. The physical examination is helpful in distinguishing among epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. Patients presenting with a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex were more likely to have a testicular torsion rather than epididymitis or torsion of appendix testis. An absent cremasteric reflex was the most sensitive physical finding for diagnosing testicular torsion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of the acute scrotum when physical findings are equivocal.
Summary 2: A retrospective study reviewed the records of 90 hospitalized patients, 18 years or younger, who were discharged with a diagnosis of testicular torsion, epididymitis, or torsion appendix testis. The cremasteric reflex was absent, and testicular tenderness present, in all 13 patients with testicular torsion.

Query: How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion?
Document: The correlation between the presence of the ipsilateral cremasteric reflex and the absence of testicular torsion was 100 per cent in a 7-year evaluation of 245 boys with acute scrotal swelling. The presence of the cremasteric reflex was the most valuable clinical finding in ruling out testicular torsion and the absence of this reflex increased the suspicion of testis torsion.
Summary:","A consecutive case series evaluated 245 boys, newborn to 18 years of age, with acute scrotal swelling. None of the 125 subjects who had an intact cremasteric reflex had ipsilateral testicular torsion. The cremasteric reflex was absent in all 56 subjects with testicular torsion. An absent cremasteric reflex in boys with acute scrotal swelling had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91%-100%), a specificity of 66% (95% CI, 59%-72%), and a likelihood ratio of a negative test (presence of a cremasteric reflex) of 0.01 (95% CI, 0.001-0.21)."

Query 1: What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss?
Document 1: The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paternal lymphocyte (PL) immunotherapy and its relation with the development of mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking antibodies (MLR-Bf) and the success of pregnancy outcome in women with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). A total of 124 women with unknown causes of abortions was registered for immunotherapy under double blind randomized trial by using the list of computer-generated numbers. Each 5 x 10(6) autologous lymphocyte (AL), third party lymphocyte (TPL) and PL was dissolved separately in 1 ml of sterile normal saline (NS). Each 1 ml of cell suspension and neat NS was injected in women with RSA through intramuscular (250 microl), intradermal (250 microl), subcutaneous (250 microl) and intravenous (250 microl) routes. All women participants with RSA received six identical immunizations at the regular interval of 4 weeks, and were then screened for the development of MLR-Bf after the completion of immunization course, and also at the first, second and third trimesters (12th, 24th and 36th weeks) of pregnancy. However, nonimmunized MLR-Bf positive women with RSA did not receive any kind of therapy (NT) and were used as one of the control group in the present study. We have observed that PL-immunized women with RSA showed a significantly increased level of MLR-Bf (>30) and pregnancy success (84%) as compared to those women with RSA who received either AL (33%), TPL (31%), NS (25%) or those who did not receive any kind of treatment (NT, 44%; P<0.001). Our results indicated the importance of immunotherapy with PL in women with RSA and also showed that MLR-Bf can be considered as one of the important factors for pregnancy improvement.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials evaluating paternal leukocyte immunization (32 patients) vs placebo (19 patients) among women with unexplained primary recurrent spontaneous abortion did find significantly higher birth rates with paternal leukocyte immunization (84% vs 25%; P=.001). This small study used different techniques than previous paternal leukocyte immunization studies.

Query 2: What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss?
Document 2: There may be an association between recurrent miscarriage and abnormal hormone function in the follicular phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin may play a role in preventing miscarriages. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of human chorionic gonadotrophin administration during early pregnancy on the risk of miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched. Date of last search: 9 January 1998. Randomised trials of human chorionic gonadotrophin compared with placebo or no treatment in women who have had two or more miscarriages. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. Four trials involving 180 women were included. The trials were of variable quality. Human chorionic gonadotrophin was associated with a reduced risk of miscarriage for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.52). This result should be interpreted cautiously because the apparent effect is greatly influenced by the two methodologically weaker studies. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin during pregnancy in order to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous miscarriage.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis reviewed 4 trials (n=180 total) of varying methodological quality, which were constructed to determine if women, with at least 2 consecutive miscarriages of unknown cause, derive any protective effect when they receive human chorionic gonadotrophin during the first trimester. Although the overall outcome favored the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (OR=0.26 compared with placebo; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52), the trials contained major methodological weaknesses (poor description of methods, no power calculations, selection and unclear randomization techniques).

Query: What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss?
Document: Immunologic aberrations might be the cause of recurrent early pregnancy loss in some women. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of leukocyte immunisation or other immunologic treatments such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched (September 2002). Individual patient data were obtained from the American Society for Reproductive Immunology. Randomised trials of immunotherapy in women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth; all recognised non-immunologic causes ruled out and no simultaneous treatment intervention. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. Nineteen trials of high quality were included. The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell immunisation (11 trials, 596 women), odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.75 to 1.47; third party donor cell immunization (3 trials, 156 women), OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (1 trial, 37 women), OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58. Paternal cell immunization, third party donor leukocytes, trophoblast membranes, and intravenous immune globulin provide no significant beneficial effect over placebo in preventing further miscarriages.
Summary:","A systematic review of 22 RCTs evaluating 4 different types of immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage found no significant improvement in live birth rates. All studies were of high quality with a low level of bias. Only onelacked double-blinding. Immunotherapy types included: paternal leukocyte immunization (PLI) (11 trials, 596 women) (OR=1.05; 95% CI, 0.75-1.47); intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (OR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.61-1.58); third-party donor cell immunization (3 trials, 156 women) (OR=1.39; 95% CI, 0.68-2.82); and trophoblast membrane infusion (1 trial, 37 women) (OR=0.40; 95% CI, 0.11-1.45)."

Document 2: Early pregnancies in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) are accompanied by a deficiency in vasodilatory and anti-aggregatory prostacyclin (PGI2) and/or overproduction of its endogenous antagonist thromboxane A2 (TXA2). We evaluated the effect of a low-dose aspirin (LDA) on PGI2 and TXA2 production and on pregnancy outcome in RSA women with and without detectable anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Of 82 RSA women studied, 66 became pregnant, and of them, 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) were randomized to receive LDA (50 mg/day) and 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) to receive placebo (PLA) from a mean of 6.6 days after the missed period to delivery. Treatment with LDA inhibited platelet TXA2 production similarly in RSA women with and without detectable ACA and with continuing pregnancies (7.0 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, LDA group versus 254.5 +/- 37.8 ng/ml, PLA group, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.0001) or miscarrying pregnancies (13.8 +/- 3.8 ng/ml compared with 233.6 +/- 59.8 ng/ml, P < 0.0001 respectively). Furthermore, LDA decreased urinary excretion of the TXA2 metabolite (2,3-dinor-TXB2) both in pregnancies which went to term (6.1 +/- 0.6 ng/mmol creatinine, LDA group versus 19.3 +/- 3.0 ng/mmol creatinine, PLA group, P < 0.0001) or again ended in miscarriage (4.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mmol creatinine versus 17.3 +/- 4.4 ng/mmol creatinine, P < 0.0001 respectively), but did not affect the excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite (2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1alpha). Early pregnancy ultrasound examination revealed a living fetus in 58 women. Of these, seven in the LDA group (23.3%, four with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations) and five in the PLA group (17.9%, two with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations; not significant) experienced a miscarriage. All infants were healthy, and the frequency of growth retardation was similar in both groups (13.0%). One woman in the LDA group (4.3%) and three women receiving PLA (13.0%) developed pre-eclampsia (not significant). Therefore, although treatment with LDA caused a desirable biochemical effect, it did not improve pregnancy outcome in RSA women with or without detectable ACA.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials involving 54 pregnant women (mean age 32.7 years) with a history of primary recurrent spontaneous abortion of unknown cause (negative standard workup) evaluated 50 mg of aspirin daily (n=27) vs placebo (n=27). The method of blinding was not reported. The live birth rate was identical for the 2 groups (88%).

Query: What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss?
Document: Alloimmunization as a treatment for recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. The present study was conducted to compare the live birth rate in the presence or absence of immunotherapy. Ninety-two women with RSA (79 primary [PA] and 13 secondary aborters[SA]) received immunotherapy. Thirty-seven RSA couples not receiving paternal alloimmunization, constituted the ""control"" group. The pregnancy rate in alloimmunized was 58 vs 46% in the control group. The live birth increased from 71% in the controls to 88% after immunotherapy. The alloimmunization induced mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking factors (MLR BFs) in 79% of women. However, they were also present in 83% of immunized women experiencing a new abortion. These results indicate that alloimmunization may be useful in the treatment of RSA.
Summary:","An RCT comparing PLI with placebo among 79 women with primary RSA of unknown cause again found no significant difference in live birth rates (89% vs 71%, respectively)."

Query 1: How should we follow athletes after a concussion?
Document 1: Lack of empirical data on recovery time following sport-related concussion hampers clinical decision making about return to play after injury. To prospectively measure immediate effects and natural recovery course relating to symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability following sport-related concussion. Prospective cohort study of 1631 football players from 15 US colleges. All players underwent preseason baseline testing on concussion assessment measures in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Ninety-four players with concussion (based on American Academy of Neurology criteria) and 56 noninjured controls underwent assessment of symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability immediately, 3 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days after injury. Scores on the Graded Symptom Checklist (GSC), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a neuropsychological test battery. No player with concussion was excluded from participation; 79 players with concussion (84%) completed the protocol through day 90. Players with concussion exhibited more severe symptoms (mean GSC score 20.93 [95% confidence interval [CI], 15.65-26.21] points higher than that of controls), cognitive impairment (mean SAC score 2.94 [95% CI, 1.50-4.38] points lower than that of controls), and balance problems (mean BESS score 5.81 [95% CI, -0.67 to 12.30] points higher than that of controls) immediately after concussion. On average, symptoms gradually resolved by day 7 (GSC mean difference, 0.33; 95% CI, -1.41 to 2.06), cognitive functioning improved to baseline levels within 5 to 7 days (day 7 SAC mean difference, -0.03; 95% CI, -1.33 to 1.26), and balance deficits dissipated within 3 to 5 days after injury (day 5 BESS mean difference, -0.31; 95% CI, -3.02 to 2.40). Mild impairments in cognitive processing and verbal memory evident on neuropsychological testing 2 days after concussion resolved by day 7. There were no significant differences in symptoms or functional impairments in the concussion and control groups 90 days after concussion. Collegiate football players may require several days for recovery of symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability after concussion. Further research is required to determine factors that predict variability in recovery time after concussion. Standardized measurement of postconcussive symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability may enhance clinical management of athletes recovering from concussion.
Summary 1: A cohort study of US college football players found that while postural stability commonly returns in just a day or 2, cognitive recovery often takes 3 to 5 days, and symptoms last over 7 days post-injury for 1 of 8 concussed athletes.

Document 2: Approximately 300 000 sport-related concussions occur annually in the United States, and the likelihood of serious sequelae may increase with repeated head injury. To estimate the incidence of concussion and time to recovery after concussion in collegiate football players. Prospective cohort study of 2905 football players from 25 US colleges were tested at preseason baseline in 1999, 2000, and 2001 on a variety of measures and followed up prospectively to ascertain concussion occurrence. Players injured with a concussion were monitored until their concussion symptoms resolved and were followed up for repeat concussions until completion of their collegiate football career or until the end of the 2001 football season. Incidence of concussion and repeat concussion; type and duration of symptoms and course of recovery among players who were injured with a concussion during the seasons. During follow-up of 4251 player-seasons, 184 players (6.3%) had a concussion, and 12 (6.5%) of these players had a repeat concussion within the same season. There was an association between reported number of previous concussions and likelihood of incident concussion. Players reporting a history of 3 or more previous concussions were 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.6) times more likely to have an incident concussion than players with no concussion history. Headache was the most commonly reported symptom at the time of injury (85.2%), and mean overall symptom duration was 82 hours. Slowed recovery was associated with a history of multiple previous concussions (30.0% of those with > or =3 previous concussions had symptoms lasting >1 week compared with 14.6% of those with 1 previous concussion). Of the 12 incident within-season repeat concussions, 11 (91.7%) occurred within 10 days of the first injury, and 9 (75.0%) occurred within 7 days of the first injury. Our study suggests that players with a history of previous concussions are more likely to have future concussive injuries than those with no history; 1 in 15 players with a concussion may have additional concussions in the same playing season; and previous concussions may be associated with slower recovery of neurological function.
Summary 2: A large prospective cohort study of 2900 US college football players found that players with 1 previous concussion had a 40% increased risk of future concussion, and those with 3 previous concussions had a three-fold increase in risk.

Query 1: What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children?
Document 1: Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare desmopressin with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: March 2002. The reference list of a previous version of this review was also searched. All randomised trials of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Comparison interventions included placebo, other drugs, alarms or behavioural methods. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Forty one randomised trials involving 2760 children (of whom 1813 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared with another drug in four trials, and with alarms in seven. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment compared with placebo (e.g. 20 microg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.57). Children on desmopressin were more likely to become dry (e.g. RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 mcg 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. In one small trial, desmopressin resulted in more wet nights than alarms towards the end of treatment (WMD 1.4, 95% CI: 0.14 to 2.66) and the chance of failure or relapse after alarms was less (RR 9.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 65.90). Although there were fewer wet nights during alarm treatment supplemented by desmopressin compared with alarms alone (WMD -1.35, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.38), the data are inconclusive about whether this is reflected in lower failure (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.50) or subsequent relapse rates (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10). Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions can only be tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 oz) fluid during desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.
Summary 1: In a Cochrane review, children treated with desmopressin had 1.7 fewer wet nights (WMD=1.7; 95% CI, -2.95 to -0.45) in the first week compared with children treated with alarms. However, at the end of 3 months, alarms were associated with 1.4 fewer wet nights per week than children treated with desmopressin (WMD=1.4; 95% CI, 0.14 to 2.66).

The NNT to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights is 7. However, the data suggest once treatment stops, there is little difference between desmopressin and placebo. This combination treatment did not show a benefit with failure rates (not attaining 14 consecutive dry nights) or a statistically significant difference in failure and relapse rates once treatment stopped."

Document 1: In separate multicentre, randomized, double-blind clinical trials, 1% ciclopirox olamine cream was compared with its cream vehicle and with 1% clotrimazole cream as treatment for tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Patients who demonstrated clinical and mycological findings consistent with the diagnoses of tinea corporis or tinea cruris were included in the study. Clinical and mycological evaluations were made pretreatment, at the end of each of the four weeks of treatment, and weekly for the two weeks immediately following cessation of treatment. In both studies, use of ciclopirox olamine cream resulted in demonstrable improvements after the first week of therapy and in complete clinical and mycological clearing in two thirds of the patients at the end of the treatment period. These results were maintained through the two-week drug-free observation period that followed the end of treatment. Statistically, the results with ciclopirox olamine cream were significantly better than those with the vehicle and were equivalent to those with clotrimazole cream. All treatments were well tolerated.
Summary 1: One randomized controlled trials compared cure rates for 139 patients for clotrimazole 1% cream compared with ciclopirox olamine 1% cream when both were applied twice daily for 28 days. By the end of the 4-week period, 69% of the clotrimazole group was clinically and mycologically cured compared with 64% of the ciclopirox group.

Query: What is the best way to treat tinea cruris?
Document: Miconazole nitrate (2.0%) cream was evaluated in the treatment of endemic dermatophytosis in an overcrowded prison. The active drug was compared in a random double-blind study with its control vehicle in the treatment of 99 inmates who had moderate to severe symptomatic disease. Tinea cruris and tinea pedis caused by Trichophyton rubrum predominated, although Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans were also isolated and identified. Prompt clinical clearing occurred in 75.5% of those treated with miconazole versus 12.0% of those treated with the vehicle alone. Results of mycological examination closely paralleled and confirmed these clinical results.
Summary:","Miconazole 2% cream (Micatin, Monistat) (used twice daily for 2 weeks by inmates in a Florida prison) demonstrated 75.5% clinical clearing (against tinea cruris, pedis, or corporis, or Candida cutaneous infections) when compared with placebo (NNT=1.57). Of the 99 patients evaluated, 48 were diagnosed with tinea cruris; however, results were not broken down into diagnostic category. The length of follow-up for these patients was not disclosed."

Query 1: What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts?
Document 1: Cutaneous warts are a common presenting complaint in children and adolescents. Common, plantar, or flat warts are cutaneous manifestations of the human papillomavirus. The treatment of warts poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians. No single therapy has been proven effective at achieving complete remission in every patient. As a result, many different approaches to wart therapy exist. These approaches are discussed to demonstrate the evidence supporting common therapies and provide a guideline for physicians. Evidence supports the at-home use of topical salicylic acid and physician-administered cryotherapy. Intralesional immunotherapy for nongenital cutaneous warts may be an option for large or recalcitrant warts.
Summary 1: Since adverse effects from treatment, such as pain and scarring, can occur, patients should be educated as to options of therapy (or no therapy).

Query 2: What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts?
Document 2: Viral warts caused by the human papilloma virus represent one of the most common diseases of the skin. Any area of skin can be affected although the hands and feet are by far the commonest sites. A very wide range of local treatments are available. To assess the effects of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy people. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (January 2003), the Skin Group trials register (January 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) and a number of other key biomedical and health economics databases. In addition the cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were searched. Pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts and experts in the field were contacted. The most recent searches were carried Randomised controlled trials of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent human hosts were included. Study selection and assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent reviewers. Fifty two trials were identified which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. The evidence provided by these studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting. In 17 trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 30% (range 0 to 73%) after an average period of 10 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks). The best available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid, which are clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from six placebo-controlled trials show a cure rate of 144/191 (75%) compared with 89/185 (48%) in controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 6.36), random effects model. Most of the bigger trials of cryotherapy studied different regimens rather than comparing cryotherapy with other treatments or placebo. Pooled data from two small trials that included cryotherapy and placebo or no treatment, showed no significant difference in cure rates. In two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid and one comparing duct tape with cryotherapy no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated. There was no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin. Four studies, using warts rather than individuals as the unit of analysis, had widely varying results which could not be meaningfully pooled. There was some evidence for the efficacy of dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizer. Pooled data from two small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo showed cure rates of 32/40 (80%) and 15/40 (38%) respectively, odds ratio 6.67 (95% confidence interval 2.44 to 18.23), random effects model. Only limited evidence was found for the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy.Bleomycin, dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil, interferons and photodynamic therapy are potentially hazardous or toxic treatments. There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use of the local treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy and some evidence that it is only of equivalent efficacy to simpler, safer treatments. Dinitrochlorobenzene appears to be effective but there were no statistically significant differences when compared with the safer, simpler and cheaper topical treatments containing salicylic acid. The benefits and risks of 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons and photodynamic therapy remain to be determined.
Summary 2: Seventeen studies of cryotherapy with between 30 and 400 patients show cure rates ranging from 29% to 87%, although most did not have placebo arms. Pooled data from 69 patients in 2 small studies did not show a benefit between the cryotherapy and nontreatment arms, although there were very low cure rates from cryotherapy in 1 study and high spontaneous remission rates in the other.

Query: Are oral agents effective for the treatment of verruca vulgaris?
Document: Viral warts are common dermatological diseases; although the rate of spontaneous recovery is high, it usually takes a long time, and some patients might not show this spontaneous healing. Zinc has an important effect on the immune system and it has been used as an immunomodulator to treat a variety of skin disorders. To assess whether oral zinc was effective in treating viral warts of patients evaluated between May 1999 and April 2000. This was a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty patients with viral warts (common, plantar and plane) were all resistant to all forms of treatment. Each patient had > 15 warts. Forty patients were treated by oral zinc sulphate at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) daily up to 600 mg day(-1) and followed-up for resolution of their warts and for any evidence of recurrence for 2-6 months. Another 40 patients were given a placebo oral treatment in the form of glucose, and followed-up for the same period. Only 23 patients of the first group (zinc treated) and 20 patients of the second group (placebo treated) completed the study. In all patients the serum level of zinc was low. In the zinc-treated group, the overall response was complete clearance of warts observed in 20 patients (86.9%) after 2 months of treatment. Fourteen patients (60.9%) showed complete disappearance of their warts after 1 month. Three patients (13.3%) failed to respond to the treatment after 2 months of therapy. The response to treatment was directly related to the increment in serum zinc level. No patient of the placebo-treated group showed any response. We conclude that zinc sulphate at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) daily seems to be a highly efficacious therapeutic option for recalcitrant viral warts and proved to be safe with few adverse effects.
Summary:","Zinc is the only agent to demonstrate efficacy in a completely randomized and placebo-controlled study. However, this trial was unblinded, had only 40 subjects assigned to each agent, had a dropout rate of 46%, and did not follow intention-to-treat analysis."

Query 1: What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?
Document 1: To evaluate the cardiovascular risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), we investigated lipid profile, metabolic pattern, and echocardiography in 30 young women with PCOS and 30 healthy age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched women. PCOS women had higher fasting glucose and insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment score of insulin sensitivity, total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and TC/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and lower HDL-C levels than controls. Additionally, PCOS women had higher left atrium size (32.0 +/- 4.9 vs. 27.4 +/- 2.1 mm; P < 0.0001) and left ventricular mass index (80.5 +/- 18.1 vs. 56.1 +/- 5.4 g/m(2); P < 0.0001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (64.4 +/- 4.1 vs. 67.1 +/- 2.6%; P = 0.003) and early to late mitral flow velocity ratio (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.2; P < 0.0001) than controls. When patients and controls were grouped according to BMI [normal weight (BMI, >18 and <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI, 25.1-30 kg/m(2)), and obese (BMI, >30 kg/m(2))], the differences between PCOS women and controls were maintained in overweight and obese women. In normal weight PCOS women, a significant increase in left ventricular mass index and a decrease in diastolic filling were observed, notwithstanding no change in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio, and TG compared with controls. In conclusion, our data show the detrimental effect of PCOS on the cardiovascular system even in young women asymptomatic for cardiac disease.
Summary 1: A prospective case-control study of young women (aged <35 years) found that compared with age- and BMI-matched controls, those with PCOS had higher levels of fasting glucose, insulin, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and altered left ventricular mass and cardiac function on echocardiogram. Once PCOS is suspected, the diagnostic work-up should include a 2-hour glucose tolerance test and lipid panel to assess cardiovascular risk, particularly among obese women.

Query 2: What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?
Document 2: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence on the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.
Summary 2: A 2002 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guideline adopted the 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus panel criteria for diagnosing PCOS (ie, chronic anovulation and clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, excluding other causes), and recommends that all patients have documentation of elevated testosterone levels; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels to exclude secondary causes of hyperandrogenism; and evaluation for metabolic abnormalities with a 2-hour glucose tolerance test and fasting lipid panel.

Query: What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?
Document: To assess the frequency of abnormal values for hormone measurements commonly used in the biochemical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hormone measurements in 63 unselected women with clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of PCOS attending gynaecological and general endocrine clinics in a District General Hospital were compared with those from a group of 20 normal ovulatory controls in the early follicular phase of their cycles. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH/FSH ratio, total testosterone, derived free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured by radioimmunoassays. LH and FSH measured by two different assays. The mean serum LH and LH/FSH ratio were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in the women with PCOS compared with the normal group, but these two measurements were in the abnormal range for only 35% and 41-44%, respectively. Absolute gonadotrophin values were significantly different using the two assay methods, which employed the same reference preparation as standard. Mean serum total testosterone concentration was significantly higher in the PCOS group and was the most frequently (70%) abnormal biochemical marker for PCOS. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) did not differ significantly between the two groups but showed a negative correlation with body mass index in women with PCOS. The combination of SHBG and testosterone to derive a free testosterone value did not further aid the biochemical diagnosis of PCOS. Androstenedione was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group, with a frequency of 53%. There was no significant difference in DHEA-S between the two groups. When typical ovarian ultrasound appearances plus the clinical features of oligomenorrhea and/or hirsuitism were used to define PCOS total testosterone was the best single hormonal marker of the condition. Testosterone, androstenedione or LH, either alone or in combination, were raised in 86% of women with PCOS and these should be the definitive hormonal tests. Using LH/FSH ratio as a biochemical criterion for diagnosis of PCOS should be abandoned because of its low sensitivity. To be of value the normal range for all hormones should be precisely defined in a group of regularly ovulating women in the early follicular phase of the cycle for the assay used in each laboratory.
Summary:","Evidence for hyperandrogenism includes hirsutism, acne, or elevated total testosterone levels."

Query 1: Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS?
Document 1: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and insulin resistance; long-term consequences include diabetes mellitus type 2. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to investigate whether the thiazolidinedione derivative pioglitazone diminishes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism and enhances ovulation rates in women with PCOS. Forty premenopausal women with PCOS were randomly allocated to treatment with either pioglitazone (30 mg/d) or placebo for periods of 3 months. Administration of pioglitazone resulted in a remarkable decline in both fasting serum insulin levels (P < 0.02) and the area under the insulin response curve after an oral glucose load (P < 0.02). This represented an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in insulin secretion (P < 0.05). Furthermore, pioglitazone increased serum SHBG (P < 0.05), resulting in a significant decrease in the free androgen index (P < 0.05 compared with placebo). Treatment with pioglitazone was also associated with higher ovulation rates (P < 0.02). Thus, pioglitazone significantly improved insulin sensitivity, hyperandrogenism, and ovulation rates in women with PCOS, thereby providing both metabolic and reproductive benefits.
Summary 1: Troglitazone has been taken off of the market due to hepatotoxicity, but results from a randomized controlled trials of 40 patients with PCOS reported that the use of pioglitazone (Actos) for 3 months increased normal regular cycles and ovulations over placebo (41.2% vs 5.6%; P<.02). No liver effects were noted, but caution must be taken since these drugs are pregnancy class C.

Query: What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?
Document: NIDDM occurs commonly among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The prevalence and natural history of its precursor, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), is less well known. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence and incidence of glucose intolerance in a large cohort of women with well-characterized PCOS. A total of 122 women with clinical and hormonal evidence of PCOS were recruited from the Medicine, Endocrinology, Gynecology, and Pediatrics Clinics at the University of Chicago. All women had a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin levels. A subset of 25 women were subsequently restudied with the aim of characterizing the natural history of glucose tolerance in PCOS. Glucose tolerance was abnormal in 55 (45%) of the 122 women: 43 (35%) had IGT and 12 (10%) had NIDDM at the time of initial study. The women with NIDDM differed from those with normal glucose tolerance in that they had a 2.6-fold higher prevalence of first-degree relatives with NIDDM (83 vs. 31%, P < 0.01 by chi 2) and were significantly more obese (BMI 41.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.1 kg/m2, P < 0.01). For the entire cohort of 122 women, there was a significant correlation between fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001); among the subset with IGT, the fasting glucose concentration was poorly predictive of the 2-h level (r = 0.25, NS). After a mean follow-up of 2.4 +/- 0.3 years (range 0.5-6.3), 25 women had a second OGTT. The glucose concentration at 2 h during the second glucose tolerance test was significantly higher than the 2-h concentration during the first study (161 +/- 9 vs. 139 +/- 6 mg/dl, P < 0.02). The prevalence of IGT and NIDDM in women with PCOS is substantially higher than expected when compared with age- and weight-matched populations of women without PCOS. The conversion from IGT to NIDDM is accelerated in PCOS. The fasting glucose concentration does not reliably predict the glucose concentration at 2 h after an oral glucose challenge, particularly among those with IGT, the subgroup at highest risk for subsequent development of NIDDM. We conclude that women with PCOS should periodically have an OGTT and must be closely monitored for deterioration in glucose tolerance.
Summary:","Women with PCOS often experience insulin resistance, and are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. One cross-sectional study of 122 women with PCOS between 13.5 and 40 years of age found that 35% had impaired glucose tolerance, and another 10% had non-insulindependent diabetes."

Query 1: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document 1: To determine differences in infection rates among uncomplicated, repaired wounds managed with: topical bacitracin zinc (BAC); neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate combination (NEO); silver sulfadiazine (SIL); and petrolatum (PTR). This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at a military community hospital with an emergency medicine residency program. Patients were enrolled if they: presented to the ED within 12 hours of injury and did not have puncture wounds, allergies to the agents used, or a history of immunocompromise; were not receiving antibiotics, chemotherapy, or steroids at the time of presentation; had not taken antibiotics within the preceding seven days; did not have an underlying fracture; and were not pregnant as determined by history. Local anesthetics without epinephrine and high-pressure irrigation with normal saline were used for all patients. Wound scrubbing, débridement, and polyglactin subcutaneous (SQ) suture placement were carried out when necessary. Interrupted simple sutures using a monofilament, nonabsorbable material were used for skin closure. Numbered, randomized vials were given to all patients, with standardized instructions to inspect, clean, and redress their wounds three times a day. The wounds were evaluated for clinical infection at the time of follow-up. Among the groups, there was no difference in patient ages; gender; wound location, type, length, or depth; time elapsed from injury to ED treatment; number of wounds scrubbed or necessitating débridement; number of SQ and cutaneous sutures used; and rate of compliance with returning the used vial of dispensed topical agent. The wound infection rates for the treatment groups were: BAC, six of 109 (5.5%); NEO, five of 110 (4.5%); SIL, 12 of 99 (12.1%); and PTR, 19 of 108 (17.6%) (p = 0.0034). The use of topical antibiotics resulted in significantly lower infection rates than did the use of a petrolatum control. BAC and NEO had the lowest wound infection rates.
Summary 1: Topical bacitracin zinc (Bacitracin), a triple ointment of neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate (Neosporin), and silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) were compared with petrolatum as a control in a well-conducted randomized controlled trials of 426 patients with uncomplicated wounds seen at a military community hospital. Wound infection rates were 17.6% (19/108) for petrolatum, 5.5% (6/109) for Bacitracin (number needed to treat [NNT]=8), 4.5% (5/110) for Neosporin (NNT=8), and 12.1% (12/99) for Silvadene (NNT=18). Most (60%) of the infections were ""stitch abscesses"" and were treated with local care only. There was no difference in rates of more serious infections between groups. One patient (0.9%) developed a hypersensitivity reaction to Neosporin.

Query 2: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document 2: An open, randomized, human-model study was conducted to compare the effects of topical antibiotics, a wound protectant, and antiseptics on the rate of wound healing and bacterial growth using a modification of a method employing ammonium hydroxide-induced intradermal blisters inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Each volunteer in the study had six blister wounds (three per forearm) to which a triple antibiotic (neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin) ointment or one of four other test agents was applied twice a day. A control wound remained untreated. All wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing after treatment. The time to healing (100 percent epithelialization) was evaluated for each wound. Wounds were cultured for bacterial growth after two treatments. Contaminated blister wounds treated with the triple antibiotic ointment healed significantly faster (mean nine days) than wounds treated with any antiseptic and those receiving no treatment. Only the neomycin-polymyxin B-bacitracin combination effectively eliminated bacterial contamination of the wounds after two applications (within 16 to 24 hours after contamination with Staphylococcus aureus). The overall clinical appearance and healing rates of wounds treated with the triple antibiotic were ranked superior to all treatments (and no treatment) except the other antibiotic ointment in the study.
Summary 2: An open randomized trial with 48 volunteers compared the effects of Neosporin with several antiseptics (3% hydrogen peroxide, 1% povidone-iodine, 0.25% acetic acid, 0.5% sodium hydrochloride) and a wound protectant (Johnson & Johnson First Aid Cream without antimicrobial agent) on blister wounds (6 blisters per volunteer) intentionally contaminated with S aureus. Only Neosporin eliminated the infection after 2 applications (at 16 and 24 hours). Both the antibiotic ointment and the wound protectant led to faster wound healing by about 4 days compared with the antiseptics or no treatment.

Query: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document: To assess the effect of white petrolatum vs bacitracin ointment on wound infection incidence, allergic contact dermatitis incidence, and healing characteristics. Randomized, double-blind, prospective trial comparing white petrolatum with bacitracin ointment in postprocedure wound care. A general outpatient dermatology clinic and a tertiary referral advanced surgical procedure clinic at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC. A total of 922 patients who had dermatologic surgery with a total of 1249 wounds. The incidence of infection and allergic contact dermatitis during a follow-up period of 4 weeks. Healing characteristics were secondary outcomes. Of the 922 patients enrolled, 440 in the white petrolatum group and 444 in the bacitracin group were evaluable for clinical response. The 2 treatment groups had comparable baseline characteristics. Thirteen patients developed postprocedure infection (1.5%), 9 (2.0%) in the white petrolatum group vs 4 (0.9%) in the bacitracin group (95% confidence interval for difference, -0.4% to 2.7%; P=.37). Eight infections (1.8%) in the white petrolatum group were due to Staphylococcus aureus vs none in the bacitracin group (P=.004). No patient in the group using white petrolatum developed allergic contact dermatitis vs 4 patients (0.9%) in the group using bacitracin (P=.12). Additionally, there were no clinically significant differences in healing between the treatment groups on day 1 (P=.98), day 7 (P=.86), or day 28 (P=.28) after the procedure. White petrolatum is a safe, effective wound care ointment for ambulatory surgery. In comparison with bacitracin, white petrolatum possesses an equally low infection rate and minimal risk for induction of allergy.
Summary:","A randomized controlled trial of 933 outpatients-with a total of 1249 wounds from sterile dermatologic surgeries-compared white petrolatum with bacitracin zinc ointment prophylaxis. The study found no statistically significant differences in post-procedure infection rates, though only 13 patients developed an infection (2% in petrolatum group vs. 0.9% in bacitracin zinc group; 95% CI for the difference, -0.4 to 2.7)."

The wound infection rates for the treatment groups were: BAC, six of 109 (5.5%); NEO, five of 110 (4.5%); SIL, 12 of 99 (12.1%); and PTR, 19 of 108 (17.6%) (p = 0.0034). The use of topical antibiotics resulted in significantly lower infection rates than did the use of a petrolatum control. BAC and NEO had the lowest wound infection rates.
Summary 1: Topical bacitracin zinc (Bacitracin), a triple ointment of neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate (Neosporin), and silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) were compared with petrolatum as a control in a well-conducted randomized controlled trials of 426 patients with uncomplicated wounds seen at a military community hospital. Wound infection rates were 17.6% (19/108) for petrolatum, 5.5% (6/109) for Bacitracin (number needed to treat [NNT]=8), 4.5% (5/110) for Neosporin (NNT=8), and 12.1% (12/99) for Silvadene (NNT=18). Most (60%) of the infections were ""stitch abscesses"" and were treated with local care only. There was no difference in rates of more serious infections between groups. One patient (0.9%) developed a hypersensitivity reaction to Neosporin.

Query 2: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document 2: Little data exists comparing the safety and efficacy of triple antibiotic ointment (TAO) and mupirocin for prevention of uncomplicated soft tissue wound infections. The purpose of this investigation was to conduct a pilot study of the relative safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of the 2 preparations. This was a randomized, prospective, interventional study to determine the difference in infection rates of uncomplicated soft tissue wounds between subjects treated with TAO and mupirocin ointment after standard wound care and suturing. Subjects were enrolled at presentation to the ED if they met the study inclusion criteria and were required to make one follow-up visit to the ED to determine the status of their wound (infected vs. not infected). A total of 99 patients were enrolled and assessed at the follow-up visit. The groups had similar rates of self-reported compliance with wound care and dressing changes. Patients in the mupirocin group had a greater rate of signs of infection (12% vs. 6.1%), and infection (4% vs. 0%) compared with patients in the TAO group, although neither difference achieved statistical significance. There were no serious adverse effects in either group. This pilot study found a similar rate of wound infection and adverse events between TAO and mupirocin ointments. Results should be confirmed in a larger equivalency trial.
Summary 2: A small randomized prospective trial of 99 patients, who self-reported compliance with wound care and dressing changes, compared Neosporin with mupirocin (Bactroban) in preventing infections in uncomplicated soft tissue wounds. The study found no statistical difference in infection rates, and the authors recommend the more cost-effective Neosporin, as well as a larger trial to confirm the results.

Query: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document: Patients undergoing contaminated head and neck surgery with flap reconstruction have wound infection rates of 20% to 25% with parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis. Studies suggest that perioperative antimicrobial mouthwash reduces oropharyngeal flora and may prevent wound infections. We hypothesized that the addition of topical antibiotics to a parenteral prophylactic regimen would reduce the incidence of wound infection in these high-risk patients. We performed a randomized, prospective clinical trial. Patients received either 1) parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 hours for 48 h) or 2) parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam plus topical piperacillin/tazobactam administered as a mouthwash immediately before surgery and once a day for 2 days postoperatively, with piperacillin/tazobactam added to the intraoperative irrigation solution. The wounds of all patients were evaluated daily using predefined objective criteria. Sixty-two patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The overall wound infection rate was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7%-17.8%). Two of 31 patients (6.4%) who received parenteral antibiotics alone developed a wound infection compared with 3 of 31 patients (9.7%) randomly assigned to receive topical plus parenteral antibiotics. This difference was not statistically significant (P = >.05). Infection rate was not associated with flap type (rotational vs. free tissue transfer), mandibular reconstruction, age, gender, tumor site, stage, surgical duration, or blood loss. These results suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a highly effective antibiotic for prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing flap reconstruction following contaminated head and neck surgery. However, the addition of topical piperacillin/tazobactam does not appear to enhance the prophylactic benefit of parenteral antibiotics alone.
Summary:",A small but well-designed study of 62 patients with major contaminated wounds failed to show any additional benefit when topical piperacillin/tazobactam (not available in US as a topical agent) was added to parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) alone. Two of 31 patients on just parenteral antibiotics and 3 of 31 patients on both topical and parenteral antibiotics developed wound infections (P>.05).

Query 1: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document 1: To determine differences in infection rates among uncomplicated, repaired wounds managed with: topical bacitracin zinc (BAC); neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate combination (NEO); silver sulfadiazine (SIL); and petrolatum (PTR). This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at a military community hospital with an emergency medicine residency program. Patients were enrolled if they: presented to the ED within 12 hours of injury and did not have puncture wounds, allergies to the agents used, or a history of immunocompromise; were not receiving antibiotics, chemotherapy, or steroids at the time of presentation; had not taken antibiotics within the preceding seven days; did not have an underlying fracture; and were not pregnant as determined by history. Local anesthetics without epinephrine and high-pressure irrigation with normal saline were used for all patients. Wound scrubbing, débridement, and polyglactin subcutaneous (SQ) suture placement were carried out when necessary. Interrupted simple sutures using a monofilament, nonabsorbable material were used for skin closure. Numbered, randomized vials were given to all patients, with standardized instructions to inspect, clean, and redress their wounds three times a day. The wounds were evaluated for clinical infection at the time of follow-up. Among the groups, there was no difference in patient ages; gender; wound location, type, length, or depth; time elapsed from injury to ED treatment; number of wounds scrubbed or necessitating débridement; number of SQ and cutaneous sutures used; and rate of compliance with returning the used vial of dispensed topical agent. The wound infection rates for the treatment groups were: BAC, six of 109 (5.5%); NEO, five of 110 (4.5%); SIL, 12 of 99 (12.1%); and PTR, 19 of 108 (17.6%) (p = 0.0034). The use of topical antibiotics resulted in significantly lower infection rates than did the use of a petrolatum control. BAC and NEO had the lowest wound infection rates.

Query 2: When should you suspect community-acquired MRSA? How should you treat it?
Document 2: Empirical use of beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred agents for treating uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections, may no longer be appropriate for these infections because of the increasing prevalence of community strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Retrospective studies, however, suggest that outcomes are good even when beta-lactams are used. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of 166 outpatient subjects comparing placebo to cephalexin at 500 mg orally four times for 7 days after incision and drainage of skin and soft tissue abscesses. The primary outcome was clinical cure or failure 7 days after incision and drainage. S. aureus was isolated from 70.4% of abscess cultures. Of the isolates tested 87.8% were MRSA, 93% of which were positive for Panton-Valentine leucocidin genes. Clinical cure rates were 90.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 0.96) in the 84 placebo recipients and 84.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.91) in the 82 cephalexin recipients (difference in the two proportions, 0.0006; 95% confidence interval, -0.0461 to 0.0472; P = 0.25). The 90.5% cure rate observed in the placebo arm and 84.1% cure rate observed in the cephalexin arm provide strong evidence that antibiotics may be unnecessary after surgical drainage of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue abscesses caused by community strains of MRSA.
Summary 2: A 2007 randomized controlled trials of 166 indigent, inner-city patients with confirmed MRSA investigated combining incision and drainage with 7 days of therapy using either cephalexin or placebo. The primary outcome was clinical cure or failure 7 days after incision and drainage. The trial found no advantage to adding antibiotics; MRSA would likely be resistant to cephalexin in any case.

Query: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document: Topical antimicrobials have been considered for treatment of secondarily infected wounds because of the potential for reduced risk of adverse effects and greater patient convenience. We compared mupirocin cream with oral cephalexin in the treatment of wounds such as small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds. In 2 identical randomized double-blind studies, 706 patients with secondarily infected wounds (small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds) received either mupirocin cream topically 3 times daily or cephalexin orally 4 times daily for 10 days. Clinical success at follow-up was equivalent in the two groups: 95.1% and 95.3% in the mupirocin cream and the cephalexin groups, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0% to 3.6%; P = .89). The intention-to-treat success rate was 83% in both groups. Bacteriologic success at follow-up was also comparable: 96.9% in the mupirocin cream and 98.9% in the cephalexin groups (95% CI, -6.0% to 2.0%; P = .22). The occurrence of adverse experiences related to study treatment was similar for the 2 groups, with fewer patients in the mupirocin cream group reporting diarrhea (1.1% vs 2.3% for cephalexin). Mupirocin cream applied topically 3 times daily is as effective as oral cephalexin given 4 times daily for the treatment of secondarily infected wounds and was well tolerated.
Summary:","A study with 2 parallel, identical RCTs of a total of 706 patients found mupirocin cream (Bactroban) to be equivalent to oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected minor wounds, such as small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds. Clinical success (95.1% for mupirocin and 95.3% for cephalexin), bacteriologic success (96.9% for mupirocin and 98.9% for cephalexin), as well as the intention-to-treat success rate of 83% at follow-up were equivalent in the 2 groups."

Query 1: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 1: Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended for persistent asthma, their long-term effect on recent onset, mild, persistent asthma has yet to be established. We did a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 7241 patients in 32 countries to assess the effects of budesonide in patients who had had mild persistent asthma for less than 2 years and who had not had previous regular treatment with glucocorticosteroids. Patients aged 5-66 years received either budesonide or placebo once daily for 3 years in addition to their usual asthma medications. The daily budesonide dose was 400 microg, or 200 microg for children younger than 11 years. The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma-related event, and analysis was by intention to treat. 198 of 3568 patients on placebo and 117 of 3597 on budesonide had at least one severe asthma exacerbation; hazard ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.45-0.71, p<0.0001). Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. Compared with placebo, budesonide increased postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline by 1.48% (p<0.0001) after 1 year and by 0.88% (p=0.0005) after 3 years (expressed as percent of the predicted value). The corresponding increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 was 2.24% after 1 year and 1.71% after 3 years (p<0.0001 at both timepoints). The effect of treatment on all outcome variables was independent of the baseline lung function (prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator) or baseline medication. In children younger than 11 years, 3-year growth was reduced in the budesonide group by 1.34 cm. The reduction was greatest in the first year of treatment (0.58 cm) than years 2 and 3 (0.43 cm and 0.33 cm, respectively). Long-term, once-daily treatment with low-dose budesonide decreases the risk of severe exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with mild persistent asthma of recent onset.
Summary 1: In the inhaled Steroid Treatment As Regular Therapy (START) in early asthma study, budesonide demonstrated a 44% relative reduction in time to first severe asthma related event, compared with placebo (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.71; NNT=44; P=.0001).

Query 2: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 2: Anti-leukotrienes agents are currently being studied as alternative first line agents to inhaled corticosteroids in mild to moderate chronic asthma. To compare the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotriene agents with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and to determine the dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes to daily dose of ICS. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Aug 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Aug 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Aug 2003), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2003), abstract books, and reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers. Randomised controlled trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids during a minimal 30-day intervention period in asthmatic patients aged 2 years and older. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality or trials and extracted trial data. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included lung function, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects and withdrawal rates. 27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration varied from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Twenty six (95% CI: 17 to 47) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra exacerbation. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes where()the improvement in FEV(1) reached 130 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL ]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Twenty nine (95% CI 20 to 48) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not different between groups. Inhaled steroids at a dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent are more effective than anti-leukotriene agents given in the usual licensed doses. The exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotriene agents in mcg of ICS remains to be determined. Inhaled glucocorticoids should remain the first line monotherapy for persistent asthma.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 15 trials reported that the protective effect of leukotriene receptor antagonists is inferior to inhaled corticosteroids for adults (relative risk [RR]=1.71; 95% CI, 1.40-2.09); however, evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to children.

Query: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document: Antiinflammatory therapies, such as inhaled corticosteroids or nedocromil, are recommended for children with asthma, although there is limited information on their long-term use. We randomly assigned 1041 children from 5 through 12 years of age with mild-to-moderate asthma to receive 200 microg of budesonide (311 children), 8 mg of nedocromil (312 children), or placebo (418 children) twice daily. We treated the participants for four to six years. All children used albuterol for asthma symptoms. There was no significant difference between either treatment and placebo in the primary outcome, the degree of change in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value) after the administration of a bronchodilator. As compared with the children assigned to placebo, the children assigned to receive budesonide had a significantly smaller decline in the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC, expressed as a percentage) before the administration of a bronchodilator (decline in FEV1:FVC, 0.2 percent vs. 1.8 percent). The children given budesonide also had lower airway responsiveness to methacholine, fewer hospitalizations (2.5 vs. 4.4 per 100 person-years), fewer urgent visits to a caregiver (12 vs. 22 per 100 person-years), greater reduction in the need for albuterol for symptoms, fewer courses of prednisone, and a smaller percentage of days on which additional asthma medications were needed. As compared with placebo, nedocromil significantly reduced urgent care visits (16 vs. 22 per 100 person-years) and courses of prednisone. The mean increase in height in the budesonide group was 1.1 cm less than in the placebo group (22.7 vs. 23.8 cm, P=0.005); this difference was evident mostly within the first year. The height increase was similar in the nedocromil and placebo groups. In children with mild-to-moderate asthma, neither budesonide nor nedocromil is better than placebo in terms of lung function, but inhaled budesonide improves airway responsiveness and provides better control of asthma than placebo or nedocromil. The side effects of budesonide are limited to a small, transient reduction in growth velocity.
Summary:","The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) study, which included 1041 children, evaluated treatment with either budesonide or nedocromil vs placebo. Patients taking budesonide had a lower rate of urgent care visits (absolute risk reduction [ARR]=10%; number needed to treat [NNT]=10; P=.02) compared with children taking nedocromil (ARR=6%; NNT=17; P=.02). The urgent care visits were reported as number of visits per 100 person-years. Children taking budesonide experienced 21.5% more episode-free days than those taking placebo (P=.01). No change was observed in the nedocromil group."

Query 2: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 2: The optimal treatment for mild asthma is uncertain. We assessed the effects of adding a long-acting inhaled beta-agonist, formoterol, to low doses of an inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, for 1 yr in subjects with mild asthma, receiving no or only a small dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The 698 corticosteroid free patients (Group A) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, or placebo. The 1,272 corticosteroid-treated patients (Group B) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, 200 microg budesonide, or 200 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol. The main outcome variables were time to the first severe asthma exacerbation and poorly controlled asthma days. In Group A, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. By contrast, in Group B, adding formoterol reduced the risk for the first severe exacerbation and for poorly controlled days by 43 and 30%, respectively. Thus, in corticosteroid-free patients, low dose inhaled budesonide alone reduced severe exacerbations and improved asthma control, and in patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid, adding formoterol was more effective than doubling the corticosteroid dose.
Summary 2: Evidence does not support use of long-acting beta-agonists as monotherapy or in combination with other medications for children with mild persistent asthma. Although 1 study showed an improvement in lung function for children taking budesonide plus formoterol compared with budesonide alone, the rate of severe exacerbations was lower for those taking budesonide alone (62% decrease vs 55.8% decrease; P=.001). Both groups had a 32% decrease in the number of rescue inhalations per day when compared with placebo (P=.0008).

Query: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document: Inhaled corticosteroids and oral theophylline are effective treatments for moderate asthma. We sought to compare the benefits and adverse reactions of theophylline and aerosol beclomethasone spray. A multicenter, double-blind, double-placebo, randomized, controlled trial of 1-year duration was performed. Seven hundred forty-seven patients with asthma received either beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol spray (84 microg four times per day) or sustained-release theophylline twice per day in doses adjusted for optimum control of the disease. The main outcome measures were daily diary of symptoms and peak flow rates (recorded on a mark-sense computer-readable form); supplemental bronchodilator use; doctor's office or hospital visits and absence from work or school; spirometry; methacholine testing; adverse experiences; and cortisol blood measurements. Both treatment strategies reduced symptoms promptly and achieved low absenteeism from work or school and low rates of emergency treatment for asthma. Both maintained nearly normal pulmonary function. Beclomethasone was statistically significantly more effective in reducing symptoms, supplemental bronchodilator and systemic glucocorticoid doses, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophilia. However, the magnitude of these differences was small. Theophylline caused more headache, nervousness, insomnia, and gastrointestinal distress, and more patients discontinued treatment because of side effects. Beclomethasone caused more oropharyngeal candidiases and hoarseness and reduced morning plasma cortisol levels before and after cosyntropin. It reduced the rate of growth in children. No new cataracts or glaucoma developed. Theophylline effectively controlled symptoms at lower than the customarily recommended blood level. The risk/ benefit profiles of these agents suggest that inhaled corticosteroids may be the preferred agent for most adult patients and for some children.
Summary:","Theophylline is considered an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids. One study compared beclomethasone with theophylline in 195 children. This study found near-equivalent efficacy in doctor visits, hospitalizations, monthly peak expiratory flow rates, and FEV1; however, beclomethasone was superior to theophylline in maintaining symptom control and decreasing the use of inhaled bronchodilators and systemic steroids. When compared with beclomethasone, theophylline was linked to 14% more central nervous system adverse effects (P<.001) and 17% more gastrointestinal disturbances (P<.001). Although beclomethasone induced more oral candidiasis compared with theophylline (8.9% vs 2.4%; P<.001), the incidence of this infection can be reduced by using a spacer."

Query 1: Angiotensin blockade for diabetes: Monitor microalbuminuria?
Document 1: Microalbuminuria and hypertension are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression to diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are lacking for hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. A total of 590 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were enrolled in this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of irbesartan, at a dose of either 150 mg daily or 300 mg daily, and were followed for two years. The primary outcome was the time to the onset of diabetic nephropathy, defined by persistent albuminuria in overnight specimens, with a urinary albumin excretion rate that was greater than 200 microg per minute and at least 30 percent higher than the base-line level. The base-line characteristics in the three groups were similar. Ten of the 194 patients in the 300-mg group (5.2 percent) and 19 of the 195 patients in the 150-mg group (9.7 percent) reached the primary end point, as compared with 30 of the 201 patients in the placebo group (14.9 percent) (hazard ratios, 0.30 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.61; P< 0.001] and 0.61 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.08; P=0.081 for the two irbesartan groups, respectively). The average blood pressure during the course of the study was 144/83 mm Hg in the placebo group, 143/83 mm Hg in the 150-mg group, and 141/83 mm Hg in the 300-mg group (P=0.004 for the comparison of systolic blood pressure between the placebo group and the combined irbesartan groups). Serious adverse events were less frequent among the patients treated with irbesartan (P=0.02). Irbesartan is renoprotective independently of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.
Summary 1: During a 2-year trial-in which 590 patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria were randomized to receive placebo, 150 mg irbesartan, or 300 mg irbesartan-14.9% of the placebo group, 9.7% of the 150-mg group, and only 5.2% of the 300-mg group progressed to overt nephropathy.

However, no data are available on the use of ACE inhibitors to prevent the decrease in renal function in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the effect of prolonged ACE inhibition on renal function and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 6-year follow-up. Eight outpatient clinics coordinated by a department of medicine in a university hospital. 156 patients in whom type 2 diabetes was diagnosed after 40 years of age who had a baseline mean blood pressure less than 107 mm Hg and albuminuria (albumin excretion < or = 30 mg/24 h). Enalapril, 10 mg/d, or placebo. Degree of albuminuria at 24 hours, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c values. Enalapril therapy decreased albumin excretion from a mean +/- SD of 11.6 +/- 7 mg/24 h to 9.7 +/- 6 mg/24 h at 2 years. This was followed by a gradual increase to 15.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h at 6 years. In the placebo group, albumin excretion increased from 10.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h to 26.5 +/- 10 mg/24 h at 6 years (P = 0.001 for enalapril compared with placebo). Transition to microalbuminuria occurred in 15 of 79 (19%) placebo recipients and 5 of 77 (6.5%) enalapril recipients. Enalapril treatment resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 12.5% (95% CI, 2% to 23%; P = 0.042) for development of microalbuminuria. After 6 years, creatinine clearance decreased from 1.78 +/- 0.13 mL/s to 1.63 +/- 0.12 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.025 mL/s per year) in enalapril recipients and from 1.81 +/- 0.15 mL/s to 1.57 +/- 0.17 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.04 mL/s per year) in placebo recipients (P = 0.040). Hemoglobin A1c values decreased modestly in both groups. Mean blood pressure remained normal (< 107 mm Hg) in all patients. Enalapril attenuated the decline in renal function and reduced the extent of albuminuria in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy.
Summary 2: A trial compared enalapril (Vasotec) 10 mg/d with placebo in 194 normotensive patients (aged 40-60) with type 2 diabetes and without microalbuminuria, defined as albumin excretion rate >30 mg/24 hr. Over the 6-year course of the study, the albumin excretion rate in the placebo group rose from 10.8 mg/24 hr to 26.5 mg/24 hr. The albumin excretion rate of the treatment group dropped from 11.6 mg/24 hr initially to 9.7 mg/24 hr at 2 years, then rose to 15.8 mg/24 hr at 6 years. Enalapril significantly slowed the rise in albumin excretion rate (RRR=0.4; P=.001). Nineteen percent of the placebo group developed microalbuminuria, compared with 6.5% of those taking enalapril (absolute risk reduction[ARR]=12.5%; number needed to treat=8; P=.042). While this study described a modest and statistically significant renal protective effect of enalapril, it did not use an intention-to-treat analysis.

Query: Angiotensin blockade for diabetes: Monitor microalbuminuria?
Document: We evaluated the renoprotective effects as reflected by short-term changes in albuminuria of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by adding an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to treatment with maximal recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. A total of 20 patients (17 men and 3 women) with type 2 diabetes along with hypertension and nephropathy were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, two-period, crossover trial of 8 weeks of treatment with the ARB candesartan 16 mg daily and placebo added in random order to existing treatment with lisinopril/enalapril 40 mg daily or captopril 150 mg daily. At the end of each treatment period, we evaluated albuminuria in three 24-h urinary collections by turbidimetry, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) using the Takeda-TM2420, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the (51)Cr-EDTA plasma-clearance technique. During monoblockade of the RAS by ACEI treatment, albuminuria was 706 (349-1,219) mg/24 h [geometric mean (IQR)]; 24-h ABP was 138 +/- 3/72 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SE); and GFR was 77 +/- 6 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) (mean +/- SE). During dual blockade of the RAS by addition of candesartan 16 mg daily, there was a mean (95% CI) reduction in albuminuria of 28 (17-38) compared with ACEI alone (P < 0.001). There was a modest reduction in systolic/diastolic 24-h ABP of 3/2 mmHg (-2 to 8 systolic, -2 to 5 diastolic; NS). Changes in albuminuria did not correlate to changes in ABP. Addition of candesartan 16 mg daily induced a small, insignificant decrease in GFR of 4 (-1 to 9) ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2). Dual blockade of the RAS provides superior short-term renoprotection independent of systemic blood pressure changes in comparison with maximally recommended doses of ACEI in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as nephropathy.
Summary:","In very small randomized trial of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes, adding 16 mg of candesartan to the maximal dose of an ACE inhibitor decreased albuminuria an additional 28%."

Query 1: Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with coronary artery disease?
Document 1: To establish guidelines for the screening and treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in the investigation and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Measurement of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels in the fasting state or 4-6 hours after oral methionine load; vitamin supplementation with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12; adherence to the recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B6 and B12. This article reviews the available evidence on the association between plasma tHcy levels and CAD and the effect of lowering tHcy levels through vitamin supplementation or dietary intake. MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles published from January 1966 to June 1999; also reviewed were additional articles identified from the bibliographies. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Homocysteine, generated in the metabolism of methionine, may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the general population is between 5% and 10% and may be as high as 30%-40% in the elderly population. If population-based studies are correct, tHcy may be responsible for up to 10% of CAD events and thus may represent an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Laboratory testing for tHcy is currently restricted to research centres, and costs range from $30 to $50 per person. Newer, less costly techniques have been developed and should become readily available with time. The strength of evidence was evaluated using the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend the screening or management of hyperhomocysteinemia at present (grade C recommendation), adherence to recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 should be encouraged. If elevated tHcy levels are discovered, vitamin deficiency should be ruled out to allow specific treatment and prevention of complications, such as neurological sequelae due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Experts in the field advocate treatment of elevated tHcy levels in high-risk people, such as those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerosis or a predisposition to develop hyperhomocysteinemia. Definitive guidelines for the management of hyperhomocysteinemia await the completion of randomized trials to establish the effect of vitamin supplementation on CAD events. The findings of this analysis were reviewed through an iterative process by the members of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care is funded through a partnership between the Provincial and Territorial Ministries of Health and Health Canada.
Summary 1: In 22 of 27 retrospective case-control studies, patients with coronary artery disease had significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels than control subjects (odds ratio [OR]=1.2-10.9, after adjustment for other coronary artery disease risk factors). However, only 4 of 7 prospective nested case-control trials showed a correlation between elevated homocysteine and myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary death.

Document 2: Plasma homocysteine level has been recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor that predicts adverse cardiac events in patients with established coronary atherosclerosis and influences restenosis rate after percutaneous coronary intervention. To evaluate the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 553 patients referred to the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, from May 1998 to April 1999 and enrolled after successful angioplasty of at least 1 significant coronary stenosis (> or = 50%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of folic acid (1 mg/d), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, 400 micro g/d), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg/d) (n = 272) or placebo (n = 281) for 6 months. Composite end point of major adverse events defined as death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and need for repeat revascularization, evaluated at 6 months and 1 year. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (3) months, the composite end point was significantly lower at 1 year in patients treated with homocysteine-lowering therapy (15.4% vs 22.8%; relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96; P =.03), primarily due to a reduced rate of target lesion revascularization (9.9% vs 16.0%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97; P =.03). A nonsignificant trend was seen toward fewer deaths (1.5% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.16-1.70; P =.27) and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.6% vs 4.3%; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.24-1.51; P =.27) with homocysteine-lowering therapy. These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders. Homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 significantly decreases the incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention.
Summary 2: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of folate reporting clinical endpoints has been completed. The study analyzed folate supplementation in 553 post-PCI patients. Patients were treated with 1 mg of folate plus 10 mg of vitamin B6 and 400 µg of vitamin B12 for 6 months after the PCI. After a mean follow-up of 11 months, the rate of restenosis requiring revascularization was lower in the vitamin-treated study arm (9.9% vs 16% restenosis rate; relative risk [RR]=0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.97; number needed to treat=16). There was also a nonsignificant trend toward fewer deaths and MIs in the treated arm at both 6 and 12 months after intervention (death: 1.5% vs 2.8%; RR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.016-1.7; MI: 2.6% vs 4.3%; RR=0.60; 95% CI, 0.24-1.51). Statin use was similar in both control (71%) and treatment groups (69%).

Query: Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with CAD?
Document: To determine the size of reduction in homocysteine concentrations produced by dietary supplementation with folic acid and with vitamins B-12 or B-6. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of folic acid based supplements on blood homocysteine concentrations. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effects on homocysteine concentrations of different doses of folic acid and of the addition of vitamin B-12 or B-6. Individual data on 1114 people included in 12 trials. The proportional and absolute reductions in blood homocysteine produced by folic acid supplements were greater at higher pretreatment blood homocysteine concentrations (P < 0.001) and at lower pretreatment blood folate concentrations (P < 0.001). After standardisation to pretreatment blood concentrations of homocysteine of 12 mumol/l and of folate of 12 nmol/l (approximate average concentrations for Western populations), dietary folic acid reduced blood homocysteine concentrations by 25% (95% confidence interval 23% to 28%; P < 0.001), with similar effects in the range of 0.5-5 mg folic acid daily. Vitamin B-12 (mean 0.5 mg daily) produced an additional 7% (3% to 10%) reduction in blood homocysteine. Vitamin B-6 (mean 16.5 mg daily) did not have a significant additional effect. Typically in Western populations, daily supplementation with both 0.5-5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B-12 would be expected to reduce blood homocysteine concentrations by about a quarter to a third (for example, from about 12 mumol/l to 8-9 mumol/l). Large scale randomised trials of such regimens in high risk populations are now needed to determine whether lowering blood homocysteine concentrations reduces the risk of vascular disease.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials found that folate supplementation, with vitamin B6 and B12, reduces plasma homocysteine levels. However, the long-term clinical consequences of these interventions are unknown."

Query: Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with CAD?
Document: We sought to conduct a randomized trial with folic acid 0.5 mg/day in a patient population with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Folic acid has favorable effects on vascular endothelium and lowers plasma homocysteine levels. In addition, homocysteine appears to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. However, the value of folic acid in secondary prevention had seldom been tested. In this open-label study, 593 patients were included; 300 were randomized to folic acid and 293 served as controls. Mean follow-up time was 24 months. At baseline all patients had been on statin therapy for a mean of 3.2 years. In patients treated with folic acid, plasma homocysteine levels decreased by 18%, from 12.0 +/- 4.8 to 9.4 +/- 3.5 micromol/l, whereas these levels remained unaffected in the control group (p < 0.001 between groups). The primary end point (all-cause mortality and a composite of vascular events) was encountered in 31 (10.3%) patients in the folic acid group and in 28 (9.6%) patients in the control group (relative risk 1.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.63 to 1.75). In a multifactorial survival model with adjustments for clinical factors, the most predictive laboratory parameters were, in order of significance, levels of creatinine clearance, plasma fibrinogen, and homocysteine. Within two years, folic acid does not seem to reduce clinical end points in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) while on statin treatment. Homocysteine might therefore merely be a modifiable marker of disease. Thus, low-dose folic acid supplementation should be treated with reservation, until more trial outcomes become available.
Summary:","A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of folate reporting clinical endpoints has been completed. The study analyzed folate supplementation in a patient population with known, stable CAD and found no difference in clinical endpoints at 24 months. In this study, 593 patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/d of folic acid or placebo. The primary study endpoint was a composite of events including: overall mortality, sudden death, MI, stroke, and major vascular surgery. The study was powered to detect a 50% reduction in clinical events based on existing observational data in populations with CAD. An event rate of 15% for the 2-year interval was assumed. All patients in this study were on statin therapy prior to initiation of folate supplementation."

Query 1: Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma?
Document 1: The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer. We conclude that spacers and nebulizers are equally effective means of delivering beta 2-agonists to children with acute asthma.
Summary 1: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 33 children aged 6 to 14 years showed no difference in metered dose inhaler spacer vs nebulizer, as measured by clinical score, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1). The researchers calculated the study had 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in FEV1 of 12% of the predicted value between the groups.

Document 2: To evaluate the current literature about the efficacy of providing inhaled medications by metered-dose inhalers and accessory devices (MDI/ADs) to children with acute asthma and to compare it with the current standard of care, small-volume nebulizers (SVNs). Online computer and manual searches in English-language journal articles published between 1980 and 1996. Seventeen prospective clinical trials that have used MDI/ADs in the treatment of acute asthma in children were retrieved. Ten randomized controlled studies that included a comparison with SVN treatment were selected. Studies were assessed qualitatively by their subject characteristics, design, intervention procedures, outcome measures, and results. There were marked variations in types of MDI/ADs and in doses administered between and within studies. Major outcome measures included pulmonary function measurements and clinical scores. All studies found MDI/ADs to be effective in the treatment of infants and children with acute asthma. Among those who compared this treatment with SVN, 2 found the MDI/AD superior and the rest found it as effective as the SVN. The data support the effectiveness of MDI/ADs as first-line treatment in acute childhood asthma. In view of clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration of MDI/ADs compared with SVNs, MDI/ADs should be considered the preferred mode of treatment of children with acute asthma.
Summary 2: One article reviewed the literature from 1980 to 1996 and examined 17 prospective clinical trials. Outcomes measured included pulmonary function measures and clinical scores. The researchers recommended that metered dose inhaler spacer be used due to clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration.

Query: Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma?
Document: To determine whether the administration of beta-agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device is as effective as the administration of beta-agonists by nebulizer for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children. Randomized trial with two arms. Urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in Bronx, NY. Convenience sample of 152 children 2 years and older with a history of at least two episodes of wheezing presenting to the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of a beta-agonist (albuterol) by an MDI with spacer or by a nebulizer. Dosing intervals and the use of other medications were determined by the treating physician. Baseline characteristics and asthma history were recorded. Asthma severity score, peak expiratory flow rate in children 5 years or older, and oxygen saturation were determined at presentation and before admission or discharge. The groups did not differ in age, sex, ethnicity, age of onset of asthma, or asthma severity score at presentation. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes, including mean changes in respiratory rate, asthma severity score, and peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, number of treatments given, administration of steroids in the ED, and admission rate. Patients given MDIs with spacers required shorter treatment times in the ED (66 minutes vs 103 minutes, P < .001). Fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ED (9% vs 20%, P < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, P < .001). These data suggest that MDIs with spacers may be an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.
Summary:","A randomized controlled trial of 152 patients found no difference in primary outcomes of asthma severity score, oxygen saturation, and percent predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Several secondary outcomes slightly favored MDI/S: number of treatments given, whether steroids were used, change in heart rate, side effects, rate of hospital admission, and treatment time in the emergency department."

In view of clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration of MDI/ADs compared with SVNs, MDI/ADs should be considered the preferred mode of treatment of children with acute asthma.
Summary 2: One article reviewed the literature from 1980 to 1996 and examined 17 prospective clinical trials. Outcomes measured included pulmonary function measures and clinical scores. The researchers recommended that metered dose inhaler spacer be used due to clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration.

Query: Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma?
Document: To determine if administration of albuterol by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is as efficacious as administration of albuterol by nebulizer to treat wheezing in children aged 2 years and younger. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Pediatric emergency department. From a convenience sample of wheezing children aged 2 to 24 months, 85 patients were enrolled in the nebulizer group and 83 in the spacer group. The nebulizer group received a placebo metered-dose inhaler with a spacer followed by nebulized albuterol. The spacer group received albuterol by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer followed by nebulized isotonic sodium chloride solution. Treatments were given every 20 minutes by a single investigator blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was admission rate. Pulmonary Index score and oxygen saturation were measured initially and 10 minutes after each treatment. The nebulizer group had a significantly higher mean (SD) initial Pulmonary Index score compared with the spacer group (7.6 [2.5] vs 6.6 [2.0]; P =.002). With the initial Pulmonary Index score controlled, children in the spacer group were admitted less (5% vs 20%; P =.05). Analyses also revealed an interaction between group and initial Pulmonary Index score; lower admission rates in the spacer group were found primarily in children having a more severe asthma exacerbation. Our data suggest that metered-dose inhalers with spacers may be as efficacious as nebulizers for the emergency department treatment of wheezing in children aged 2 years or younger.
Summary:","One study showed a lower admission rate in 85 patients who were 2 to 24 months in the MDI/S group. Controlling for the initial Pulmonary Index score, children using an MDI and Aerochamber spacer were admitted less often (5% vs 20%, number needed to treat=7; P=.05) than children using nebulizers. Since the results of this single small trial are the only data available for this younger age group, using MDI/S instead of nebulizers should be done with caution for children aged <2 years."

Query 1: What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray?
Document 1: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a potentially useful but expensive test to diagnose solitary pulmonary nodules. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for pulmonary nodule diagnosis and to specifically compare strategies that did and did not include FDG-PET. Decision model. Accuracy and complications of diagnostic tests were estimated by using meta-analysis and literature review. Modeled survival was based on data from a large tumor registry. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. All adult patients with a new, noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen on chest radiograph. Patient lifetime. Societal. 40 clinically plausible combinations of 5 diagnostic interventions, including computed tomography, FDG-PET, transthoracic needle biopsy, surgery, and watchful waiting. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The cost-effectiveness of strategies depended critically on the pretest probability of malignancy. For patients with low pretest probability (26%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were possibly malignant cost as little as 20 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with high pretest probability (79%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were benign cost as little as 16 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with intermediate pretest probability (55%), FDG-PET strategies cost more than 220 000 dollars per QALY gained because they were more costly but only marginally more effective than computed tomography-based strategies. The choice of strategy also depended on the risk for surgical complications, the probability of nondiagnostic needle biopsy, the sensitivity of computed tomography, and patient preferences for time spent in watchful waiting. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, FDG-PET strategies were cost saving or cost less than 100 000 dollars per QALY gained in 76.7%, 24.4%, and 99.9% of computer simulations for patients with low, intermediate, and high pretest probability, respectively. FDG-PET should be used selectively when pretest probability and computed tomography findings are discordant or in patients with intermediate pretest probability who are at high risk for surgical complications. In most other circumstances, computed tomography-based strategies result in similar quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs.
Summary 1: A solitary pulmonary nodule, or ""coin lesion"", is an intraparenchymal finding on chest radiograph or computerized tomography that is less than 3 to 4 cm in diameter and not associated with atelectasis or adenopathy. Malignancy rates range from 15% to 75%, depending on the population studied.

Query 2: What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray?
Document 2: To determine the test performance characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer. A systematic search of MEDLINE, HealthStar, and Cochrane Library databases to July 2001 and print bibliographies was performed to identify studies comparing the results of sputum cytology, bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspirate (TTNA), or biopsy with histologic reference standard diagnoses among at least 50 patients with suspected lung cancer. For sputum cytology, the pooled specificity was 0.99 and the pooled sensitivity was 0.66, but sensitivity was higher for central lesions than for peripheral lesions (0.71 vs 0.49, respectively). Studies on bronchoscopic procedures provided data only on diagnostic yield (sensitivity). The diagnosis of endobronchial disease by bronchoscopy in 30 studies showed the highest sensitivity for endobronchial biopsy (0.74), followed by cytobrushing (0.59) and washing (0.48). The sensitivity for all modalities combined was 0.88. Thirty studies reported on peripheral lesions. Cytobrushing demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.52), followed by transbronchial biopsy (0.46) and BAL/washing (0.43). The overall sensitivity for all modalities was 0.69. Peripheral lesions < 2 cm or > 2 cm in diameter showed sensitivities of 0.33 and 0.62, respectively. Updating a previous meta-analysis with 19 studies revealed a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 for TTNA. A trend toward lower sensitivity was noted for lesions that were < 2 cm in diameter. The accuracy in differentiating between small cell and non-small cell cytology for the various diagnostic modalities was 0.98, with individual studies ranging from 0.94 to 1.0. The average false-positive and false-negative rates were 0.09 and 0.02, respectively. The sensitivity of bronchoscopy is high for endobronchial disease and poor for peripheral lesions that are < 2 cm in diameter. The sensitivity of TTNA is excellent for malignant disease. The distinction between small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer by cytology appears to be accurate.
Summary 2: A recent systematic review of studies evaluating patients with suspected lung cancer looked into the diagnostic sensitivity of various methods of histologic and cytologic tests. Researchers compared the evaluated test results to a reference standard of pathology/histology, definitive cytology, or at least 1-year radiographic follow-up. Transbronchial needle aspiration showed a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 64%-70%) for peripheral lung malignancy of any size; however, only 5 studies met study criteria and their sample sizes varied greatly (n=20 to n=480). Eight studies looking at bronchoscopy (including brush or biopsy) for peripheral lung lesions <2 cm in diameter yielded a sensitivity of only 33% (95% CI, 28%-38%). In the same systematic review, 61 studies of transthoracic needle aspiration for localized pulmonary lesions of any size had a pooled sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%). The prevalence of malignancy in the studies ranged from 0.58 to 0.93.15 Factors affecting heterogeneity between studies included the wide range in study dates, imaging technology used, and study sizes.

Summary:","CT appears cost-effective when the pretest probability of malignancy is <90%; therefore, consider it on virtually all new cases of solitary pulmonary nodules. Also, when CT and pretest risk-assessments are discordant (eg, a patient has a low pretest probability of malignancy but his CT is suggestive of malignancy), the FDG PET scan is the most economically feasible at less than $20,000 per quality-adjusted life year."

Query 2: What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray?
Document 2: More than 150,00 patients a year present to their physicians with the diagnostic dilemma of a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) found either on chest radiography or chest CT. A thoughtful and timely workup of this finding is essential if lung cancer is to be recognized early and the chance for cure optimized. Based on the literature to date, recommendations are made for appropriate imaging modalities and diagnostic testing, as well as indications for obtaining preoperative tissue diagnosis for the patient with an SPN.
Summary 2: Although early detection of malignancy portends a major improvement in survival (up to 75% at 5 years following surgical resection of stage intra-articular disease), most lung cancers progress asymptomatically until quite advanced.

Query: What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray?
Document: A clinical prediction model to identify malignant nodules based on clinical data and radiological characteristics of lung nodules was derived using logistic regression from a random sample of patients (n = 419) and tested on data from a separate group of patients (n = 210). To use multivariate logistic regression to estimate the probability of malignancy in radiologically indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in a clinically relevant subset of patients with SPNs that measured between 4 and 30 mm in diameter. A retrospective cohort study at a multispecialty group practice included 629 patients (320 men, 309 women) with newly discovered (between January 1, 1984, and May 1, 1986) 4- to 30-mm radiologically indeterminate SPNs on chest radiography. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer within 5 years prior to the discovery of the nodule were excluded. Clinical data included age, sex, cigarette-smoking status, and history of extrathoracic malignant neoplasm, asbestos exposure, and chronic interstitial or obstructive lung disease; chest radiological data included the diameter, location, edge characteristics (eg, lobulation, spiculation, and shagginess), and other characteristics (eg, cavitation) of the SPNs. Predictors were identified in a random sample of two thirds of the patients and tested in the remaining one third. Sixty-five percent of the nodules were benign, 23% were malignant, and 12% were indeterminate. Three clinical characteristics (age, cigarette-smoking status, and history of cancer [diagnosis, > or = 5 years ago]) and 3 radiological characteristics (diameter, spiculation, and upper lobe location of the SPNs) were independent predictors of malignancy. The area (+/-SE) under the evaluated receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8328 +/- 0.0226. Three clinical and 3 radiographic characteristics predicted the malignancy in radiologically indeterminate SPNs.
Summary:",The best available clinical decision rule was derived and validated from a single split population of patients with solitary pulmonary nodules. The outcome variable was defined as malignancy based on histologic tissue analysis or benignity by radiographic stability or resolution over 2 years. The authors did not report whether those determining outcomes and predictors were appropriately blinded.

Query 1: Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women?
Document 1: The value of exercise testing in women has been questioned. To determine the prognostic value of exercise testing in a population-based cohort of asymptomatic women followed up for 20 years. Near-maximal Bruce-protocol treadmill test data from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study (1972-1976) with follow-up through 1995. A total of 2994 asymptomatic North American women, aged 30 to 80 years, without known cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. There were 427 (14%) deaths during 20 years of follow-up, of which 147 were due to cardiovascular causes. Low exercise capacity, low heart rate recovery (HRR), and not achieving target heart rate were independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. There was no increased cardiovascular death risk for exercise-induced ST-segment depression (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-1.80; P =.96). The age-adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular death for every metabolic equivalent (MET) decrement in exercise capacity was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.18-1.30; P<.001); for every 10 beats per minute decrement in HRR, the hazard ratio was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.19-1.55; P<.001). After adjusting for multiple other risk factors, women who were below the median for both exercise capacity and HRR had a 3.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death (95% CI, 1.57-7.86; P =.002) compared with those above the median for both variables. Among women with low risk Framingham scores, those with below median levels of both exercise capacity and HRR had significantly increased risk compared with women who had above median levels of these 2 exercise variables, 44.5 and 3.5 cardiovascular deaths per 10 000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death, 12.93; 95% CI, 5.62-29.73; P<.001). The prognostic value of exercise testing in asymptomatic women derives not from electrocardiographic ischemia but from fitness-related variables.
Summary 1: A large cohort study of 2994 asymptomatic women found that those women with a below-average peak exercise capacity and heart-rate recovery rate were 3.5 times more likely to die of cardiovascular causes than women who were above average (95% CI, 1.57-7.86).

Query 2: Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women?
Document 2: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women and accounts for more than half of their deaths. Women have been underrepresented in most studies of cardiovascular disease. Reduced physical fitness has been shown to increase the risk of death in men. Exercise capacity measured by exercise stress test is an objective measure of physical fitness. The hypothesis that reduced exercise capacity is associated with an increased risk of death was investigated in a cohort of 5721 asymptomatic women who underwent baseline examinations in 1992. Information collected at baseline included medical and family history, demographic characteristics, physical examination, and symptom-limited stress ECG, using the Bruce protocol. Exercise capacity was measured in metabolic equivalents (MET). Nonfasting blood was analyzed at baseline. A National Death Index search was performed to identify all-cause death and date of death up to the end of 2000. The mean age of participants at baseline was 52+/-11 years. Framingham Risk Score-adjusted hazards ratios (with 95% CI) of death associated with MET levels of <5, 5 to 8, and >8 were 3.1 (2.0 to 4.7), 1.9 (1.3 to 2.9), and 1.00, respectively. The Framingham Risk Score-adjusted mortality risk decreased by 17% for every 1-MET increase. This is the largest cohort of asymptomatic women studied in this context over the longest period of follow-up. This study confirms that exercise capacity is an independent predictor of death in asymptomatic women, greater than what has been previously established among men. The implications for clinical practice and health care policy are far reaching.
Summary 2: A cohort study of 5721 women found that an exercise capacity of <5 metabolic equivalents (METS) tripled the risk of death as compared with those with an exercise capacity of >8 METS. These studies support the role of exercise treadmill testing for risk stratification for coronary artery disease disease in women.

Query: Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women?
Document: To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise thallium, and exercise echocardiogram (echo) for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in women, English language studies published between 1966 and 1995 were identified through a MEDLINE search. Studies that contained data on at least 50 women who underwent both an exercise test and coronary angiography were examined. Studies were reviewed for sensitivity, specificity, and methodologic characteristics by 2 independent reviewers. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria for exercise electrocardiography, 5 studies for exercise thallium, and 3 studies for exercise echo. The exercise ECG had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.61 (95% confidence intervals 0.54 to 0.68), 0.70 (0.64 to 0.75), (+) LR 2.25 (1.84 to 2.66), (-) LR 0.55 (0.47 to 0.62), respectively. The exercise thallium had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of 0.78 (0.72 to 0.83), 0.64 (0.51 to 0.77), (+) LR 2.87 (1.0 to 4.96), (-) LR 0.36 (0.27 to 0.45). The exercise echo had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of 0.86 (0.75 to 0.96), 0.79 (0.72 to 0.86), (+) LR 4.29 (2.93 to 5.65), (-) LR 0.18 (0.05 to 0.31). Thallium subset analysis revealed that studies using planar imaging were more specific than those using tomographic imaging. Thus, currently available exercise tests are only moderately sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in women.
Summary:","A large meta-analysis of 19 studies looked specifically at women (n=3721) and found that noninvasive exercise tests only ""moderately useful"" for the detection of CAD. Exercise treadmill testing in women had a specificity of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.75), a sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54-0.68), a positive likelihood ratio of 2.25 (95% CI, 1.84-2.66) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.47-0.62). In comparison, exercise treadmill testing in men had a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.77. Among the theoretical reasons for the diminished accuracy of the exercise treadmill testing in women are the varying catecholamine response to exercise, a higher incidence of mitral valve prolapse, and chest wall anatomy different than that in men."

Query 1: Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects?
Document 1: Despite anecdotal evidence of a possibility of decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCs) with some antibiotics, it is not known whether antibiotic use in dermatologic practices engenders any increased risk of accidental pregnancy. Our purpose was to examine the effect of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics (tetracyclines, penicillins, cephalosporins) on the failure rate of OCs. The records from three dermatology practices were reviewed, and 356 patients with a history of combined oral antibiotic/OC use were surveyed retrospectively. Of these patients, 263 also provided ""control"" data (during the times they used OCs alone). An additional 162 patients provided control data only. Five pregnancies occurred in 311 woman-years of combined antibiotic/OC exposure (1.6% per year failure rate) compared with 12 pregnancies in 1245 woman-years of exposure (0.96% per year) for the 425 control patients. This difference was not significant (p = 0.4), and the 95% confidence interval on the difference (-0.81, 2.1) ruled out a substantial difference (> 2.1% per year). There was also no significant difference between OC failure rates for the women who provided data under both conditions, nor between the two control groups. All our data groups had failure rates below the 3% or higher per year, which are typically found in the United States. The difference in failure rates of OCs when taken concurrently with antibiotics commonly used in dermatology versus OC use alone suggests that these antibiotics do not increase the risk of pregnancy. Physicians and patients need to recognize that the expected OC failure rate, regardless of antibiotic use, is at least 1% per year and it is not yet possible to predict in whom OCs may fail. Although some antibiotics are assumed to compromise the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCs), it is unknown whether the antibiotics used in dermatologic practice are associated with such a risk.  To address this issue, a review was conducted in three US dermatologic practices of the records of 356 patients with a history of combined oral antibiotic/OC use in 1990-95 who responded to a follow-up questionnaire.  263 of these patients provided control data during the times they used OCs alone and an additional 162 patients were controls only.  There were five pregnancies in 311 woman-years of combined antibiotic/OC exposure (1.6% annual failure rate) compared with 12 pregnancies in 1245 woman-years of exposure among controls (0.96% annual failure rate)--a nonsignificant difference.  In addition, there were no significant differences between OC failure rates among women who served as both cases and controls or between the two control groups.  All five cases who became pregnant had been taking an antibiotic (microcycline or a cephalosporin) for at least 3 months.  Side effects potentially linked to reduced OC effectiveness (e.g., diarrhea, breakthrough menstrual bleeding) were not reported by the women who became pregnant.  It is presumed that inter-individual differences in steroid plasma levels are a more important cause of OC failure than concomitant antibiotic therapy.
Summary 1: A relatively large retrospective cohort study of oral contraceptive users in a dermatological practice showed no difference in contraceptive failure rates between those prescribed common antibiotics (including tetracycline) and controls (1.6% vs 0.96%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, 0.81-2.1).

Document 2: To study the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) isolates to selected antibiotics from patients with acne vulgaris in Singapore and determine if resistance increases with prolonged use of antibiotics. A single-centre prospective study. Tertiary dermatological referral centre in Singapore. One hundred and fifty patients with acne vulgaris seen at the National Skin Centre. In patients who had never been on antibiotics, there were no resistant isolates of P. acnes. In patients who had been on short-term antibiotics (between 6 to 18 weeks), there were 2 resistant strains among the 34 isolates (6.25%); in patients who had been on antibiotics for longer periods, there were 11 resistant strains among the 51 isolates (21.6%). The differences in the rates of isolation of resistant strains between patients who had not been on antibiotics to those that had been on long-term antibiotics were statistically significant (P = 0.015). There was also a significant difference in isolation of resistant strains from those on short-term antibiotics compared to those who had been on long-term antibiotics (P = 0.036). Resistance to erythromycin was most commonly encountered. Most of the erythromycin-resistant strains also showed cross-resistance to clindamycin. The average MICs to antibiotics such as minocycline, erythromycin and clindamycin in those on long-term antibiotics were significantly higher when compared to patients who had not been on antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance in P. acnes isolates in Singapore follows similar patterns to studies conducted in Europe. Resistance to erythromycin was most commonly seen, and this is associated with cross-resistance to clindamycin. Among the tetracycline group of drugs, the average MICs to tetracycline was higher than that for doxycycline, which in turn was higher than that for minocycline. Antibiotic resistance can occur with short-term antibiotic courses, and the rate of resistance increases as the duration of antibiotic consumption increases.
Summary 2: A well-designed cohort trial showed that Propioni-bacteri-um acnes resistance was directly related to duration of antibiotic therapy.

Query: Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects?
Document: To document changes in the prevalence of resistance of Propionibacterium acnes to antibiotics used for treating acne. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for publications on P. acnes resistance to systemic antibiotics. The search strategy mapped ""acne"" or ""acne vulgaris"" with the terms ""antibiotic resistance"" or ""drug resistance, microbial"". Only papers published in English during 1976 to 1997 were included in the search. 53 publications met the search criteria. The search output was refined by selecting papers that specifically addressed P. acnes resistance patterns. Additional studies (not included in the search output) were identified from review articles and references of the retrieved articles. Twelve articles were reviewed. Data on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria, the incidence of individual resistance phenotypes, mixed resistance, and correlation between poor therapeutic response and resistant propionibacteria were extracted. Research since 1978 has suggested an association between poor therapeutic response and antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria. The overall incidence of P. acnes antibiotic resistance has increased from 20% in 1978 to 62% in 1996. Resistance to specific antibiotics varied and was most commonly reported with erythromycin and clindamycin, tetracycline and doxcycline, and trimethoprim. Resistance to minocycline is rare. In many patients with acne, continued treatment with antibiotics can be inappropriate or ineffective. It is important to recognise therapeutic failure and alter treatment accordingly. The use of long-term rotational antibiotics is outdated and will only exacerbate antibiotic resistance.
Summary:",Rotating antibiotics on a long-term basis actually increases bacterial resistance patterns and can exacerbate the problems of increasing resistance and poor treatment outcomes.

Document 1: To evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of common tests used to diagnose upper genital tract infection. Subjects included women who either met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's minimal criteria for acute pelvic inflammatory disease or who had other signs of upper genital tract infection (i.e., atypical pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, or cervicitis). The subjects were evaluated with a baseline interview, comprehensive laboratory testing, and either an endometrial biopsy or laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis of upper genital tract infection. Patients were considered positive for upper genital tract infection if they had any of the following findings: 1) histologic evidence of acute endometriosis or salpingitis, 2) laparoscopic visualization of purulent exudate in the pelvis without another source, or 3) positive testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis from the endometrium, fallopian tubes, or pelvis. One hundred twenty women with adequate endometrial samples were evaluated between August 1993 and September 1995. The median age of the study population was 24 years: 38% were white, 52% were smokers, 81% were insured by Medicaid or were uninsured, and 67% were single. Sensitivities for elevated white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and increased vaginal white blood cells are 57, 70, 71, and 78%, respectively. If any one test is abnormal, the sensitivity is 100% and specificity is 18%. If all four tests are abnormal, sensitivity is 29% and specificity is 95%. Testing for increased vaginal white blood cells was found to be the most sensitive laboratory indicator for upper genital tract infection, whereas serum WBC was the most specific. No one diagnostic laboratory test is pathognomonic for upper genital tract infection. Combinations of positive tests can improve diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value, but with a diminution of sensitivity and negative predictive value. Combinations of negative tests can reliably exclude upper genital tract infection.
Summary 1: A study developed a model using vaginal white blood cells (the single most sensitive factor at 78%), serum white blood cells (the single most specific factor at 88%), CRP, and ESR. The model was 100% sensitive if the diagnosis only required 1 positive test, although the specificity was only 18%. The positive predictive value was 65%. If all 4 were positive, specificity was 95%, with 29% sensitivity, a positive predictive value of 90%, and a negative predictive value of 47%. Prevalence was 60% in the group studied.

Query 2: Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease?
Document 2: Careful detection and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for the prevention of adverse sequelae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline characteristics of 651 patients enrolled in a multicenter randomized treatment trial for pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients, and endometrial sampling was performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression, using histologic endometritis as the criterion standard. The minimal criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a sensitivity of 83%, in comparison with a 95% sensitivity for adnexal tenderness (P =.001). Of the supportive clinical criteria, the finding most highly associated with endometritis was a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.89--6.63). A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that combinations of criteria significantly improve the prediction of endometritis. Sensitivity can be maximized by using the presence of adnexal tenderness as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, and supportive criteria are helpful in estimating the probability of endometritis.
Summary 2: Cross-sectional analysis of a multisite US randomized treatment trial supported using adnexal tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion to increase sensitivity.

Summary:","A prospective cohort study of 120 women presenting to an ambulatory center with symptoms of PID evaluated the tests commonly used to support the clinical diagnosis of PID. The objective criteria used for diagnosis included histologic evidence of acute endometritis via endometrial biopsy, purulent exudates in the pelvis on laparoscopy, or microbiologic evidence of Neisseris gonorrhea or Chlamydia trachomatis from the upper genital tract. The Table shows the sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values for an elevated white blood cells (>10,000/mm), ESR (>15 mm/hr), CRP (>5 mg/dL), and increased vaginal white blood cells (>3 white blood cells/high-power field) for detection of PID. If all 4 test results are negative, PID is reliably ruled out with a sensitivity of 100%. These results may be an overestimate, as the gold standard was not uniformly applied."

Query 1: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 1: Anti-leukotrienes agents are currently being studied as alternative first line agents to inhaled corticosteroids in mild to moderate chronic asthma. To compare the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotriene agents with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and to determine the dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes to daily dose of ICS. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Aug 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Aug 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Aug 2003), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2003), abstract books, and reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers. Randomised controlled trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids during a minimal 30-day intervention period in asthmatic patients aged 2 years and older. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality or trials and extracted trial data. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included lung function, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects and withdrawal rates. 27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration varied from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Twenty six (95% CI: 17 to 47) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra exacerbation. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes where()the improvement in FEV(1) reached 130 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL ]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Twenty nine (95% CI 20 to 48) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not different between groups. Inhaled steroids at a dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent are more effective than anti-leukotriene agents given in the usual licensed doses. The exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotriene agents in mcg of ICS remains to be determined. Inhaled glucocorticoids should remain the first line monotherapy for persistent asthma.
Summary 1: A systematic review of 15 trials reported that the protective effect of leukotriene receptor antagonists is inferior to inhaled corticosteroids for adults (relative risk [RR]=1.71; 95% CI, 1.40-2.09); however, evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to children.

Query 2: What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma?
Document 2: Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended for persistent asthma, their long-term effect on recent onset, mild, persistent asthma has yet to be established. We did a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 7241 patients in 32 countries to assess the effects of budesonide in patients who had had mild persistent asthma for less than 2 years and who had not had previous regular treatment with glucocorticosteroids. Patients aged 5-66 years received either budesonide or placebo once daily for 3 years in addition to their usual asthma medications. The daily budesonide dose was 400 microg, or 200 microg for children younger than 11 years. The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma-related event, and analysis was by intention to treat. 198 of 3568 patients on placebo and 117 of 3597 on budesonide had at least one severe asthma exacerbation; hazard ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.45-0.71, p<0.0001). Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. Compared with placebo, budesonide increased postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline by 1.48% (p<0.0001) after 1 year and by 0.88% (p=0.0005) after 3 years (expressed as percent of the predicted value). The corresponding increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 was 2.24% after 1 year and 1.71% after 3 years (p<0.0001 at both timepoints). The effect of treatment on all outcome variables was independent of the baseline lung function (prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator) or baseline medication. In children younger than 11 years, 3-year growth was reduced in the budesonide group by 1.34 cm. The reduction was greatest in the first year of treatment (0.58 cm) than years 2 and 3 (0.43 cm and 0.33 cm, respectively). Long-term, once-daily treatment with low-dose budesonide decreases the risk of severe exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with mild persistent asthma of recent onset.
Summary 2: In the inhaled Steroid Treatment As Regular Therapy (START) in early asthma study, budesonide demonstrated a 44% relative reduction in time to first severe asthma related event, compared with placebo (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.71; NNT=44; P=.0001).

Query: How effective are leukotriene inhibitors for asthma in children?
Document: We tested the hypothesis that adding montelukast to budesonide would improve asthma control in children with inhaled glucocorticoid-dependent persistent asthma. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the benefit of adding montelukast, 5 mg, or placebo once daily to budesonide, 200 microg, twice daily. After a 1-month run-in with budesonide, 200 microg, twice daily, 279 children were randomized to montelukast or placebo. The mean +/- SD age was 10.4 +/- 2.2 years, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) was 77.7% +/- 10.6% predicted, and reversibility was 18.1% +/- 12.9%. Compared with adding placebo to budesonide, adding montelukast produced significant improvements in mean percent change from baseline FEV(1) (P =.062 [P =.010 for per-protocol analysis]), mean absolute change from baseline FEV(1) (P =.040), mean increase from baseline in morning (P =.023) and evening (P =.012) peak expiratory flows, decrease in exacerbation days by approximately 23% (P <.001), decreased beta2-agonist use (P =.013), and reduced blood eosinophil counts (P <.001). The treatments did not differ significantly with regard to safety. Montelukast, 5 mg, added to budesonide improved asthma control significantly, indicated by a small additive effect on lung function and a clinically relevant decrease in asthma exacerbation days.
Summary:","One randomized, double-blind crossover study of 279 children with corticosteroid-dependent (persistent) asthma compared montelukast 5 mg (Singulair) once a day plus inhaled budesonide 200 µg (Pulmicort) twice a day with placebo plus budesonide (Rhinocort). Each study period lasted only 4 weeks, starting after a 4-week run-in period. Montelukast modestly improved asthma control over placebo. Compared with the placebo period, montelukast decreased the average use of beta-agonists by 1 puff per day. Asthma exacerbation days decreased by about 1 per month during montelukast treatment. The effects of montelukast and placebo on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), quality of life, and adverse events did not differ significantly."

Query 1: Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes?
Document 1: To report a prospective study evaluating the long-term impact of stent-supported angioplasty on renal function and blood pressure control. In a 6-year period, 456 hemodynamically significant de novo renal artery stenoses > or =70% were treated in 340 consecutive hypertensive patients (223 men; mean age 66+/-10 years, range 44-84) with or without impaired renal function. Baseline data on serum creatinine (sCr), intrarenal resistance index, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, and documentation of the number and dose of antihypertensive drugs were compared to values obtained during follow-up. The primary endpoint was a 10% decrease in sCr; the glomerular filtration rate and changes in blood pressure control were additional outcome measures. During a mean follow-up of 34+/-20 months, sCr decreased significantly from 1.45+/-0.87 to 1.39+/-0.73 mg/dL (p=0.048). In 34% of the patients, sCr decreased >10%, 39% were unchanged, and 27% had an increase >10%. Glomerular filtration rate increased from 59+/-26 to 62+/-26 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p=0.6). Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure measurements significantly improved immediately after the intervention (132/72/93 versus 144/79/102 mmHg at baseline, p<0.0001) and remained improved during follow-up (p<0.0001). Blood pressure control was improved in 46%, unchanged in 43%, and deteriorated in 11%. Baseline sCr, bilateral intervention, percent diameter stenosis, and 3-vessel coronary disease were independent predictors of improved renal function during follow-up; the number of antihypertensive drugs taken before the intervention predicted improved blood pressure control. Stent-supported angioplasty of renal artery stenoses preserves renal function and improves blood pressure control in a broader spectrum of patients than previously thought.
Summary 1: One cohort study of 150 patients found that stenting bilateral (vs unilateral) RAS predicted a more beneficial blood pressure response (OR=4.6; P=.009).

Query 2: Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes?
Document 2: Renal artery stenosis is increasingly being treated with the percutaneous insertion of stents. Little data are available to help select patients most likely to derive benefit from the procedure. Data were gathered on all patients treated with renal artery stent insertion at the Royal Melbourne Hospital prior to 1998, and who were followed-up for at least 6 months or until death. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with patient survival and renal survival (survival free of dialysis). Adequate data were available on 148 of 198 patients treated during this time (75%). A baseline creatinine over 0.15 mmol/L and age over 70 were strongly associated with worse patient survival (Likelihood ratio(LR) 9.96, p < 0.0001 and 3.4, p = 0.001 respectively) and renal survival (LR 7.8, p < 0.001 and 2.7, p < 0.01 respectively). The presence of diabetes was also associated with worse overall survival (LR 2.2, p < 0.05) but not renal survival, while the presence of another nephropathic disorder was associated with worse renal survival (LR 2.8, p < 0.01) but not overall survival. The use of ACE inhibitors after the stenting procedure was associated with a significantly better renal survival (LR 0.46, p < 0.05). Patients with baseline renal impairment, older age, diabetes or another coexistent renal disease have poor outcomes after renal artery stent insertion. A relatively conservative approach to revascularisation may be preferable in these patient groups. The use of ACE inhibitors after stent insertion is associated with a reduced likelihood of death or dialysis.
Summary 2: Worsened patient survival correlated with Cr >1.7 mg/dL or age >70 (OR=9.96, P<.0001 and OR=3.4, P=.001, respectively). Worsened renal survival was present in the same subgroups (OR=7.8, P<.001 and OR=2.7, P<.01, respectively).

Query: Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes?
Document: Many patients with peripheral vascular disease have coincident renal artery stenosis. The present study characterized the natural history of the condition. Some 98 patients (71 men) with more than 50 per cent atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (unilateral 64, bilateral 34) were recruited prospectively. Measurements of serum creatinine, blood pressure and renal size were recorded at baseline and every 6 months, for a minimum of 2 years. Data were available for 85 patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The mean age was 71 (range 51-87) years. All 52 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis were managed conservatively (group 1); 21 of the 33 patients with bilateral disease had no intervention (group 2) and the remaining 12 had angioplasty or reconstruction (group 3). The overall mortality rate was 32 per cent at 2 years (27 patients) and this was similar in all three groups. In only three patients was death related directly to renovascular disease; coronary disease accounted for the majority of deaths. All three patients who needed dialysis died within 1 year. In survivors from groups 1 and 3 there was a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration at follow-up. Blood pressure did not increase significantly. Patients with renal artery stenosis and peripheral vascular disease had a poor prognosis, but this was not directly attributable to renal failure.
Summary:","A nonblinded RCT of 85 patients found no change in mortality or renal function with intervention. Three groups were compared: observation of 52 patients with unilateral RAS (>50%), intervention on 12 patients with bilateral RAS, and observation of 21 patients with bilateral RAS. All groups reported 32% mortality at 2 years. Only 3 of the 27 deaths were directly related to renal disease (2 from the observation group with unilateral RAS and one from the intervention group)."

Query 1: When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis?
Document 1: The spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has led to increased use of mefloquine prophylaxis by US Peace Corps volunteers in sub-Saharan Africa. We compared long-term mefloquine with other drug regimens for effectiveness and tolerance. The incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infections and of adverse reactions was compared in Peace Corps volunteers who took chloroquine weekly, mefloquine weekly, mefloquine every other week, or weekly chloroquine plus daily proguanil. Weekly mefloquine was 94% more effective than chloroquine (95% CI 86% to 97%), 86% more effective than chloroquine plus proguanil (95% CI 67% to 94%), and 82% more effective than prophylaxis with mefloquine when taken every other week (95% CI 68% to 90%). No serious adverse reactions were observed. Mild adverse events were equally frequent in mefloquine users and chloroquine users, and the frequency of these events declined with increasing duration of prophylaxis. Mefloquine is an effective and well-tolerated drug for prophylaxis of malaria by short-term and long-term travellers.
Summary 1: A study of the long-term use of mefloquine in 421 healthy Peace Corps volunteers has shown it to be safe.

Query 2: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 2: To compare the efficacy and safety of five days apostrophe therapy of mebendazole (MBZ) versus quinacrine (QC) on human giardiasis in children. A clinical trial was carried out in paediatric patients (aged 5-15 years) with confirmed symptomatic G. duodenalis mono-infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either MBZ [200 mg taken three times per day (TID) (n = 61)] or QC [2 mg/kg bodyweight tid (n = 61)], both for five days. Follow-up faecal samples were obtained at 3, 5 and 7 d after the end of the treatment. Although the frequency of cure was higher for QC (83.6%) than for MBZ (78.7%), the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Adverse events were reported more in the QC group (P < 0.05), all of them transient and self-limiting. Despite final cure rates ocurring lower than expected, the overall results of this study reconfirmed the efficacy of MBZ in giardiasis and also indicate that, although comparable to QC, at least in this setting the 5 d course of MBZ did not appear to improve the cure rates in this intestinal parasitic infection.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials in Cuban children 5 to 15 years of age found no difference in clinical cure rate between a 5-day course of mebendazole and more traditional therapy with quinacrine.

Query: When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis?
Document: The in vivo and in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to a single oral dose of mefloquine (25 mg/kg body weight (M25) or 15 mg/kg (M15] was studied in children under 5 years of age in Malawi. Of the children who received mefloquine, 35% vomited at least once, and 10% did not tolerate the drug because of vomiting. The therapy failure rates for the M25 group on day 7, 14, and 28 were 15%, 18%, and 42%, respectively, and these did not differ significantly from those for the M15 group (4%, 18%, and 59%). In contrast, 34 in vitro microtests (17 per group) showed schizont inhibition at less than or equal to 32 pmol mefloquine per test well. On day 7, the concentration of mefloquine in samples of blood was significantly lower in both the M25 and M15 groups for children who were parasitaemic on day 7 than in samples from those who were aparasitaemic. A positive blood smear on day 7 was strongly associated with a mefloquine concentration of less than 500 ng/ml blood on day 2 or day 7 (P less than 0.0003). Vomiting was associated with a low mefloquine concentration on day 2 but not day 7. These results suggest that mefloquine is effective against P. falciparum in Malawi but that for young children the therapy appears to be complicated by frequent vomiting.
Summary:",One study of 293 children under the age of 5 years in Malawi found that plasma concentrations of mefloquine were below prophylactic level (500 mcg/mL) against P falciparum until the fourth to seventh week of once-weekly dosing (P<.0003).

Query 1: Do COX-2 inhibitors worsen renal function?
Document 1: Adverse effects of selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors on renal events and arrhythmia have been controversial, with suggestions of a class effect. To quantitatively evaluate adverse risks of renal events (renal dysfunction, hypertension, and peripheral edema) and arrhythmia events and to explore drug class effects and temporal trends of apparent effects of the COX-2 inhibitors: rofecoxib, celecoxib, valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib. A systematic search of EMBASE and MEDLINE (through June 2006), bibliographies, US Food and Drug Administration reports, and pharmaceutical industry clinical trial databases. From relevant reports, 114 randomized double-blind clinical trials were included. Information on publication year, participant characteristics, trial duration, drug, control, dose, and events were extracted using a standardized protocol. Results were pooled via random-effects models and meta-regressions. Of 116 094 participants from 114 trial reports including 127 trial populations (40 rofecoxib, 37 celecoxib, 29 valdecoxib + parecoxib, 15 etoricoxib, and 6 lumiracoxib), there were a total of 6394 composite renal events (2670 peripheral edema, 3489 hypertension, 235 renal dysfunction) and 286 arrhythmia events. Results indicated significant heterogeneity of renal effects across agents (P for interaction = .02), indicating no class effect. Compared with controls, rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of arrhythmia (relative risk [RR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-7.88) and composite renal events (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.33-1.76); adverse renal effects increased with greater dose and duration (both P< or =.05). For all individual renal end points, rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of peripheral edema (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.23-1.66), hypertension (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.85), and renal dysfunction (RR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.05-5.07). In contrast, celecoxib was associated with lower risk of both renal dysfunction (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94) and hypertension (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.97) compared with controls. Other agents were not significantly associated with risk. Time-cumulative analyses indicated that for rofecoxib the adverse risks for peripheral edema and hypertension were evident by the end of year 2000 and for risk of arrhythmia by 2004. In this comprehensive analysis of 114 randomized trials with 116,094 participants, rofecoxib was associated with increased renal and arrhythmia risks. A COX-2 inhibitor class effect was not evident. Future safety monitoring is warranted and may benefit from an active and continuous cumulative surveillance system.
Summary 1: A 2006 meta-analysis, including 114 trials and 116,094 patients randomized to either cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor or control (placebo, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], or mixed), indicated that the COX-2 inhibitors, as a class, had no effect on renal endpoints. Trials were reviewed for data on renal endpoints, including peripheral edema, hypertension, and renal dysfunction (defined as significant worsening of serum urea or creatinine, or clinical evidence of kidney disease and renal failure). When viewed separately, rofecoxib (Vioxx) was associated with a composite relative risk (RR) of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.76) for all renal endpoints compared with controls. In contrast, the composite relative risk for the same endpoints among patients taking celecoxib (Celebrex) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.12), indicating no effect on renal function. In fact, for the specific outcomes of hypertension and renal dysfunction, celecoxib was associated with a decreased risk compared with controls. Stratified analysis by type of control (placebo, alternate NSAID, or mixed) yielded consistent results; rofecoxib was uniquely associated with adverse renal outcomes. No effect on renal function was noted for celecoxib compared with the same controls: the relative risk for adverse renal effects was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.55-1.38), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.70-1.23), and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.94-1.69) for celecoxib vs placebo, NSAID, and mixed controls, respectively. Statistical analysis for heterogeneity showed that the variation in effects on renal function among the COX-2 inhibitors was more likely due to actual differences than due to chance (heterogeneity [I2]=57%; P<.001).

Query 2: Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone?
Document 2: To determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Efficacy: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin. Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.
Summary 2: A systematic review of selective COX-2 inhibitors vs naproxen found fewer endoscopically detected ulcers in patients taking celecoxib but no difference in serious gastrointestinal bleeds.

Query: Do COX-2 inhibitors worsen renal function?
Document: The cardiorenal safety database from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) was analyzed to examine whether supratherapeutic doses of celecoxib are associated with decreased renal function and blood pressure (BP) effects compared with standard doses of diclofenac and ibuprofen in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.In total, 8059 patients were enrolled; 7968 received at least one dose of study drug (RA: N = 2183; OA: N = 5785). Patients received celecoxib, 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.). (N = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day. (N = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg b.i.d. (N = 1996). Effects measured included: investigator-reported hypertension, edema or congestive heart failure, clinically important BP elevations, incidence of patients starting new antihypertensive medication, and increases in serum creatinine or reductions in creatinine clearance. Celecoxib was associated with a similar incidence of hypertension or edema to diclofenac but significantly lower than ibuprofen. The celecoxib group had significantly fewer initiations of antihypertensives versus ibuprofen. Systolic BP increases of >20 mmHg and above 140 mmHg occurred significantly less often with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen or diclofenac. Changes in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance occurred in a similar percentage of patients taking celecoxib or ibuprofen; modest differences were evident against diclofenac. In patients with mild prerenal azotemia, significantly fewer patients taking celecoxib exhibited clinically important reductions in renal function (3.7%), compared with diclofenac (7.3%; P < 0.05) and ibuprofen (7.3%; P < 0.05). A supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib was associated with an improved cardiorenal safety profile compared with standard doses of either ibuprofen or diclofenac.
Summary:",A randomized controlled trial compared standard dosing of diclofenac (75 mg twice daily) and ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily) with high-dose celecoxib (400 mg twice daily) for patients with normal kidney function being treated for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The mean increase in serum creatinine in the celecoxib arm was less than that noted in the diclofenac controls (0.009 mg/dL vs 0.027 mg/dL; P<.05; number needed to harm [NNH]=56). No difference in mean serum creatinine was seen among those patients using ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily) compared with those using high-dose celecoxib.

Query 1: Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best?
Document 1: Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB have no anatomical pathology, which makes medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery, an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are the most commonly prescribed. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (1985 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The review authors extracted the data independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data. No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies were assessed separately according to dosage regimen.Progestogen therapy during the luteal phase was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared with tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS). Duration of menstruation was significantly longer with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral progestogen therapy but significantly shorter with danazol treatment. Adverse events were significantly more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. Progestogen therapy from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the IUS. A significantly higher proportion of norethisterone (NET) patients taking progestogens found their treatment unacceptable compared to IUS patients. However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the IUS. Progestogens administered from day 15 or 19 to day 26 of the cycle offer no advantage over other medical therapies such as danazol, tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the IUS in the treatment of menorrhagia in women with ovulatory cycles. Progestogen therapy for 21 days of the cycle results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, although women found the treatment less acceptable than intrauterine levonorgestrel. This regimen of progestogen may have a role in the short-term treatment of menorrhagia.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review examined the use of cyclical progestogens (given from 10 to 20 days per cycle) for heavy menstrual bleeding. Cyclical progestogens appeared comparable in efficacy to NSAIDs for their effect on duration of menstruation; no statistically significant difference in menstrual blood loss was noted. Progestogens given in more continuous regimens offered greater benefit in terms of blood loss.

Query 2: Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best?
Document 2: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women and it accounts for 12% of all gynaecology referrals in the UK. Heavy menstrual bleeding is clinically defined as greater than or equal to 80 ml of blood loss per menstrual cycle. However, women may complain of excessive bleeding when their blood loss is less than 80 ml. Hysterectomy is often used to treat women with this complaint but medical therapy may be a successful alternative. The intrauterine coil device was originally developed as a contraceptive but the addition of uterine relaxing hormones, progestogens, to these devices resulted in a large reduction in menstrual blood loss. Case studies of two types of progesterone or progestogen-releasing systems, Progestasert and Mirena, reported reductions of up to 90% and that dysmenorrhoea may be improved. Insertion, however, may be regarded as invasive by some women, which affects its acceptability as a treatment. Frequent intermenstrual bleeding and spotting is also likely during the first few months. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in achieving a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding. All studies which might describe randomised controlled trials of progesterone or progestagen-releasing intrauterine devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained by electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to 2005). Companies producing progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices and experts in the field were contacted for information on published and unpublished trials. Randomised controlled trials in women of reproductive age treated with progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices versus no treatment, placebo, or other medical or surgical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding within primary care, family planning or specialist clinic settings were eligible for inclusion. Women with postmenopausal bleeding, intermenstrual or irregular bleeding, or pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded. Potential trials were independently assessed by three review authors and nine trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The reviewers extracted the data independently and data were pooled where appropriate. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated from the data for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes. The primary outcome was reduction in menstrual blood loss but incidence of side effects, changes in quality of life, satisfaction and acceptability measures were also assessed. Progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems have not been compared to placebo or no treatment. Progestasert has been compared to a number of different medical therapies in one small study but no conclusions can be made about its effectiveness. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) has been compared to oral cyclical norethisterone (NET) administered on days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle in one trial and was significantly more effective although there was a large reduction in loss from baseline in both groups. Some short term side effects were more common in the LNG IUS group but a significantly greater proportion of women in this group were satisfied and willing to continue with their treatment. In one trial of women awaiting hysterectomy, where the LNG IUS was compared with a control group taking their existing medical therapy, a higher proportion of the women in the intrauterine device group cancelled their planned surgery after six months of treatment. The LNG IUS has been compared to an endometrial ablation: either transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) (two trials) or balloon ablation (three trials). There was a significantly greater mean reduction in menstrual bleeding in one trial in those undergoing balloon ablation (WMD -45.2 units, 95% CI -56.9 to -33.5), a lower score on the pictorial blood loss chart (PBAC) (WMD 33.2 units, 95% CI 27.2 to 39.2) and higher rates of successful treatment in 3 trials including both balloon and TCRE (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58) but the rates of satisfaction with treatment was were similar. There was no conclusive evidence of changes in quality of life between groups but women with the LNG IUS had a greater incidence of progestogenic side effects within one year. The LNG IUS has been compared to hysterectomy in one trial. There was no evidence of a change in quality of life scores but the LNG IUS treatment had lower costs than with hysterectomy, both at one and five-years follow up. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) is more effective than cyclical norethisterone (for 21 days) as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Women with an LNG IUS are more satisfied and willing to continue with treatment but experience more side effects, such as intermenstrual bleeding and breast tenderness. The LNG IUS results in a smaller mean reduction in menstrual blood loss (as assessed by the PBAC chart) than endometrial ablation but there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of satisfaction with treatment. Women with an LNG IUS experience more progestogenic side effects compared to women having TCRE for treatment of their heavy menstrual bleeding but there is no evidence of a difference in their perceived quality of life. The LNG IUS treatment costs less than hysterectomy but there is no evidence of a difference in quality of life measures between these groups. There are no data available from randomised controlled trials comparing progesterone-releasing intrauterine systems to either placebo or other commonly used medical therapies for heavy menstrual bleeding.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review found that progestogen-releasing IUDs significantly reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and are more effective than cyclical norethisterone (21 days). Patients did, however, report greater progestogenic side effects (breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding) than cyclical therapy. One unblinded randomized controlled trials that randomized women scheduled for hysterectomy for heavy bleeding to the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) or their existing medical therapy (not further described) found that women in the LNG-IUD group were more likely to cancel surgery. Another randomized controlled trials comparing hysterectomy with the LNG-IUD found that women with the LNG-IUD reported greater pain. The LNG-IUD was more cost effective at 1 and 5 years, primarily because of reduced surgical expenses. Some patients or physicians may have ethical issues with the device's mechanism of action.

Query: Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best?
Document: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in premenopausal women. Although surgery is often used as a treatment, a range of medical therapies are also available. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce prostaglandin levels which are elevated in women with excessive menstrual bleeding and also may have a beneficial effect on dysmenorrhoea. The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years HMB. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched April 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), EMBASE (1985 to April 2007), CINAHL (1982 to April 2007), Current Contents (1993 to April 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs with either each other, placebo or other medical treatments in women with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic (treatment induced) causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss. Seventeen RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review and data were extracted independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data of nine trials. The results of the remaining seven crossover trials with data unsuitable for pooling and one trial with skewed data were described in the Other Data section. As a group, NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding but less effective than either tranexamic acid, danazol or the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS). Treatment with danazol caused a shorter duration of menstruation and more adverse events than NSAIDs but this did not appear to affect the acceptability of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between NSAIDs and the other treatments (oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, an older progesterone releasing intra-uterine system (Progestasert), oral contraceptive pill (OCC)) but most studies were underpowered. There was no evidence of a difference between the individual NSAIDs (naproxen and mefenamic acid) in reducing HMB. NSAIDs reduce HMB when compared with placebo but are less effective than either tranexamic acid, danazol or LNG IUS. However, adverse events are more severe with danazol therapy. In the limited number of small studies suitable for evaluation, no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated between NSAIDs and other medical treatments such as oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, OCC or another type of IUS, Progestasert.
Summary:","A Cochrane review of 16 small RCTs that examined the use of NSAIDs for menorrhagia found NSAIDs to be superior to placebo and comparable to other medical treatments such as luteal progestin, oral contraceptive pills, and progestin-releasing intrauterine systems."

Query 1: Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy?
Document 1: Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates. All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966-2001), HealthSTAR (1975-2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes. We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes. Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64-2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33-5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0-2.9) after 5 years of use. Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.
Summary 1: The findings of the women's health initiative and HERS trials have been summarized in a recent meta-analysis done for the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Query 2: Should we screen women for hypothyroidism?
Document 2: The objective of our study was to estimate the expected change in serum lipoprotein concentrations after treatment with T4 in patients with mild thyroid failure (i.e. subclinical hypothyroidism). Our data sources included MEDLINE, between January 1966 and May 1999, and review of references from relevant articles. There were 1,786 published studies identified, 461 abstracts reviewed, 74 articles retrieved, 24 articles evaluated against predetermined entry criteria, and 13 studies systematically reviewed and abstracted. All studies reported serum total cholesterol concentration changes during T4 treatment, 12 reported triglyceride changes, 10 reported high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changes, and 9 reported low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol changes. There were 247 patients in 13 studies. The mean decrease in the serum total cholesterol concentration was -0.20 mmol/L (-7.9 mg/ dL), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.09 to -0.34. The decline in serum total cholesterol was directly proportional to its baseline concentration. Studies enrolling hypothyroid participants receiving suboptimal T4 doses reported significantly larger decreases in serum total cholesterol after thyroid-stimulating hormone normalization than studies enrolling previously untreated individuals with mild thyroid failure [-0.44 mmol/L (-17 mg/dL) vs. -0.14 mmol/L (-5.6 mg/dL), P = 0.05]. The change in serum LDL cholesterol concentration was -0.26 mmol/L (-10 mg/dL), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.12 to -0.41. Serum HDL and triglyceride concentrations showed no change. These results, although based on fewer than 250 patients, suggest that T4 therapy in individuals with mild thyroid failure lowers mean serum total and LDL cholesterol concentrations. The reduction in serum total cholesterol may be larger in individuals with higher pretreatment cholesterol levels and in hypothyroid individuals taking suboptimal T4 doses. There do not seem to be significant effects of T4 on serum HDL or triglyceride concentrations.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis combined 13 studies, involving 247 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, all of whom were given thyroid replacement. All studies reported a decrease in total cholesterol (mean -7.9 mg/dL), and 9 reported a decrease in low density lipoprotein (mean -10 mg/dL).

Query: Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best?
Document: To evaluate the putative benefits of combined continuous hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. A Medline search was performed for relevant English-language studies published during 1981-1995. METHOD OF STUDY SELECTION: Forty-two studies were identified, all using a continuous daily regimen of an estrogen and a progestin given to postmenopausal women with intact uteri. Each study was reviewed for the design, number of subjects enrolled, duration of protocol, and type and dosage of medications used. Data were extracted from texts, tables, figures, or personal communications regarding the effects of treatment on patient compliance (ie, drop-out rates), the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms, uterine bleeding patterns, endometrial histology, and lipid and bone density measurements. These data were then arranged in tabular form for the purpose of comparing and identifying trends. The lipid data from six randomized, double-blind studies that compared sequential and combined continuous regimens of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate were further analyzed by meta-analysis. Findings revealed compliance rates of approximately 80% (range 35-100). Vasomotor symptoms improved almost universally. Irregular uterine bleeding was noted to be a common problem in the first 6 months of treatment; thereafter, most studies reported rates of amenorrhea of 75% or greater. In patients undergoing endometrial biopsy, rates of atrophic endometrium were noted to be 90-100%, and rates of endometrial hyperplasia were less than 1%. Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium was documented in two patients with a history of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and bleeding after established amenorrhea. The effects of treatment on lipid levels varied from study to study, but a meta-analysis revealed the combined continuous and sequential regimens to produce a treatment-associated decline in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Studies examining bone density documented either no change or an increase with treatment. Combined continuous hormone replacement is well accepted by patients in clinical trials, effective in relieving vasomotor symptoms, and produces amenorrhea (though often after an initial period of irregular bleeding), an atrophic endometrium, and favorable changes in circulating lipids as well as maintaining bone density. Data on the impact of this regimen on long-term patient compliance, cardiovascular disease risk, and urogenital atrophy are lacking.
Summary:","A systematic review, comprised primarily of RCTs, examined uterine bleeding patterns in 3000 postmenopausal women taking combined continuous hormones (various regimens of estrogen and progestin). In 22 of 23 studies that included data past 6 months, 75% or more of participants became amenorrheic while on therapy. Irregular uterine bleeding before 6 months of therapy was common, however, and was presumed to lower patient compliance."

Query 1: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document 1: To derive and validate a clinical decision rule that can help to prioritize patients who are on waiting lists for polysomnography, Prospective data collection on consecutive patients referred to a sleep center. The Newcastle Sleep Disorders Centre, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. Consecutive adult patients who had been scheduled for initial diagnostic polysomnography. Eight hundred and thirty-seven patients were used for derivation of the decision rule. An apnea-hypopnoea index of at least 5 was used as the cutoff point to diagnose sleep apnea. Fifteen clinical features were included in the analyses using logistic regression to construct a model from the derivation data set. Only 5 variables--age, sex, body mass index, snoring, and stopping breathing during sleep--were significantly associated with sleep apnea. A scoring scheme based on regression coefficients was developed, and the total score was trichotomized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups with prevalence of sleep apnea of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively. Color-coded tables were developed for ease of use. The clinical decision rule was validated on a separate set of 243 patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that the decision rule performed well, with the area under the curve being similar for both the derivation and validation sets: 0.81 and 0.79, P =.612. We conclude that this decision rule was able to accurately classify the risk of sleep apnea and will be useful for prioritizing patients with suspected sleep apnea who are on waiting lists for polysomnography.
Summary 1: A 2004 prospective evaluation examined a clinical decision rule on 837 patients referred for polysomnogram that used age, sex, BMI, snoring, and cessation of breathing during sleep to stratify patients into low-, moderate-, or high-risk groups. The study found obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome prevalences of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively.

Query 2: Do imaging studies aid diagnosis of acute sinusitis?
Document 2: The objective of this study was to assess the discriminative properties of the methods for diagnosing acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) in unselected patients. The study design was a systematic review of evaluation studies identified by using Medline, by searching reference lists, by hand searches, and by contacting investigators. Evaluation studies were conducted anywhere in the world. Subjects were adults with suspected AMS. Main outcome measures were: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios of the primary studies, weighted means of these parameters in each comparison (clinical examination, radiography, and ultrasound compared to a reference standard in diagnosing AMS), and summary ROC curves and their Q* points where sensitivity equals specificity. For the years from 1962 to present, 49 study reports were found; 11 articles on studies that included a total of 1144 patients were eligible. Compared to sinus puncture, radiography was the most accurate method for diagnosing AMS: the Q* point on the summary ROC curve was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.78-0.85). Ultrasound was slightly less accurate than radiography compared to sinus puncture (Q* 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83). Only two articles reported clinical examination compared to sinus puncture and the Q* for them was 0.75 (95% 0.58-0.86). Clinical examination is a rather unreliable method for diagnosing AMS, even in the hands of experienced specialists. Using radiography or ultrasound improves the accuracy of diagnosis. The diagnosis of AMS is rarely studied in primary care settings. Future comparative trials should preferably combine diagnosis and treatment, evaluating the two aspects of clinical management as unit.
Summary 2: Varonen concluded that clinical evaluation has a sensitivity of roughly 0.75, whereas radiographic methodologies have sensitivities>0.80.

Query: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document: To establish the evidence base for the diagnosis of sleep apnea (SA) in adult patients, a systematic review of the literature from 1980 through November 1, 1997 was performed. Diagnostic studies were included if they reported results of any test to establish or support a diagnosis of SA, in comparison to a diagnosis from a full polysomnogram (PSG). Test results were meta-analyzed using fixed effects models and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) to examine consistency of tests within and between diagnostics vs. the ""gold standard"" of PSG. From a total of 937 studies, 249 fit the broad eligibility criteria for inclusion in the clinical trial database and its data were extracted from these reports; useable data for statistical analyses were reported in 71 studies (7,572 patients). The sensitivity and specificity of partial channel and partial time PSGs appeared most promising as replacements for full PSG in patients suspected of obstructive SA. Clinical prediction rules (multivariate models) were also promising. Studies of portable sleep monitors, radiologic or morphologic features, and focused questionnaires were too heterogeneous to be meta-analyzed. In general, the diversity of study designs and objectives were very high and the methodological rigor of these studies as assessments of diagnostic tests was very low. Thus, we are still not in a position to recommend standardization of diagnostic methodology for sleep apnea. Instead, our recommendations for future research include standardization of terms and diagnostic criteria, and consistently reported statistics to enhance the utility of this literature.
Summary:","A systematic review and meta-analysis of 249 studies of sleep apnea diagnosis from 1980 through November 1997 concluded that studies of focused questionnaires were too heterogeneous to be combined in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were good for clinical prediction rules in general, but evidence was insufficient to justify adoption of any single model."

Query 2: Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea?
Document 2: To assess separately the effectiveness and safety of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) and that of surgery in comparison to conservative management in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). DESIGN. A randomized study with 1-year follow-up. A university hospital acting as a referral center for OSAS. Symptomatic patients with OSAS (72 male and 4 female patients aged 18 to 65 years), who had oxygen desaturations in the overnight recording. After the initial diagnostic workup, patients were considered to be candidates for either N-CPAP (44 patients) or surgical treatment (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP] with or without mandibular osteotomy) (32 patients). Within the groups, the patients were then randomized to either the assigned treatment or conservative management. The number of nocturnal oxygen desaturation events of 4% or more per hour in bed (ODI4); daytime somnolence; side effects. N-CPAP Group: Compliance with N-CPAP therapy at 1 year was 13 of 21. The most common reason for noncompliance was general intolerance of CPAP. All compliant patients had a normal ODI4 ( < 10), whereas 1 of 20 of their control subjects had a normal finding. Patients receiving active treatment were significantly less somnolent than their control subjects at 1 year (p < 0.05). SURGERY GROUP: At 1 year, 7 of 18 of the surgically treated and 1 of 14 of the conservatively treated patients had a normal ODI4 (p < 0.001). Daytime somnolence was significantly less severe in the surgically treated patients compared with their control subjects (p < 0.001) both at 3 and 12 months. The overall postoperative complication rate was 22%. N-CPAP is an effective therapy for OSAS, but compliance is a problem. Surgical therapy (UPPP with or without mandibular osteotomy) needs further evaluation.
Summary 2: Lojander et al compared uvulopharyngopalatoplasty (UPPP) to conservative management (weight loss, smoking cessation, and alcohol avoidance advice) in 32 patients. Patients were excluded if they had asthma, obesity (body mass index >40), restless leg syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or intolerance of missed work because of somnolence. Remaining patients were selected as possible surgical candidates by a team of hospital-based experts then randomized to surgery or conservative therapy. At 1 year of follow-up, they found no change in nocturnal oxygen desaturation but some improvement in the mean score of a visual analog scale of daytime sleepiness and in the mean self-report of out-of-bed sleeping episodes. Unfortunately these subjective outcome measures have not been validated and are subject to bias. This, in addition to lack of intention-to-treat analysis, renders these results uninterpretable.

Query: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document: Optimization of the indications for nocturnal polysomnography in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) could lead to significant reductions in health expenditure. To this end, we assessed the usefulness of truncal obesity measurements in the diagnosis of OSAS. One hundred ninety-two patients (152 men and 40 women) referred to our clinic with suspected OSAS underwent a complete polysomnography study and their BMI and truncal obesity measurements were obtained. Comparison of patients defined as snorers with OSAS patients, by means of the Student's t -test revealed significant differences in the truncal obesity parameters such as waist-to-hip ratio (0.94 vs. 0.98) and waist circumference (100.7 cm vs. 106.3 cm). We found no significant differences between BMI values in the two groups. Indices of truncal obesity were analyzed as predictive factors for OSAS using a multivariate logistic regression model that included variable sex, and in which waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, neck circumference, and age were analyzed as binary variables. According to this model, our patients' risk of suffering from OSAS was 2.6 times greater if the waist-to-hip ratio was >1 in men and >0.85 in women. The risk of OSAS was also increased if the patients were men or over 52 years of age. Obtaining simple measurements such as those for truncal obesity may help prioritize the use of polysomnography in patients with a greater risk of OSAS. Our results suggest that BMI is not a good predictor of OSAS in a group of patients with a high BMI.
Summary:",A cross-sectional study correlating OSAHS with truncal obesity in 192 patients referred to a sleep clinic found that the likelihood of OSAHS was 2.6 times greater if the waist-to-hip ratio was >1 in men and >0.85 in women.

Query 1: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document 1: To derive and validate a clinical decision rule that can help to prioritize patients who are on waiting lists for polysomnography, Prospective data collection on consecutive patients referred to a sleep center. The Newcastle Sleep Disorders Centre, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. Consecutive adult patients who had been scheduled for initial diagnostic polysomnography. Eight hundred and thirty-seven patients were used for derivation of the decision rule. An apnea-hypopnoea index of at least 5 was used as the cutoff point to diagnose sleep apnea. Fifteen clinical features were included in the analyses using logistic regression to construct a model from the derivation data set. Only 5 variables--age, sex, body mass index, snoring, and stopping breathing during sleep--were significantly associated with sleep apnea. A scoring scheme based on regression coefficients was developed, and the total score was trichotomized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups with prevalence of sleep apnea of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively. Color-coded tables were developed for ease of use. The clinical decision rule was validated on a separate set of 243 patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that the decision rule performed well, with the area under the curve being similar for both the derivation and validation sets: 0.81 and 0.79, P =.612. We conclude that this decision rule was able to accurately classify the risk of sleep apnea and will be useful for prioritizing patients with suspected sleep apnea who are on waiting lists for polysomnography.
Summary 1: A 2004 prospective evaluation examined a clinical decision rule on 837 patients referred for polysomnogram that used age, sex, BMI, snoring, and cessation of breathing during sleep to stratify patients into low-, moderate-, or high-risk groups. The study found obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome prevalences of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively.

Query 2: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document 2: Although sleep apnea is common, it often goes undiagnosed in primary care encounters. To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79. The Berlin Questionnaire provides a means of identifying patients who are likely to have sleep apnea.
Summary 2: The Berlin Questionnaire assesses snoring, daytime sleepiness, history of hypertension, age, and body mass index (BMI). The questionnaire was evaluated in 744 adults presenting for unrelated problems at 5 primary care sites. Of 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, a finding of high risk on the Berlin Questionnaire predicted an apnea-hypopnea index >5 with 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity, a positive likelihood ratio of 3.79.

Query: Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction?
Document: To assess the clinical usefulness of the Mallampati score in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Mallampati scoring of the orophyarynx is a simple noninvasive method used to assess the difficulty of endotracheal intubation, but its clinical usefulness has not been validated in patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Prospective multivariate assessment of a predictor variable. The UCSF Sleep Disorders Center. One hundred thirty-seven adult patients who were evaluated for possible obstructive sleep apnea. Prospective determination of the Mallampati score, assessment of other variables for multivariate analysis, and subsequent overnight polysomnography. The Mallampati score was an independent predictor of both the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. On average, for every 1-point increase in the Mallampati score, the odds of having obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index> or = 5) increased more than 2-fold (odds ratio [per 1-point increase] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-5.0; p = .01), and the apnea-hypopnea index increased by more than 5 events per hour (coefficient = 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.2-10; p = .04). These results were independent of more than 30 variables that reflected airway anatomy, body habitus, symptoms, and medical history. Our results indicate that Mallampati scoring is a useful part of the physical examination of patients prior to polysomnography. The independent association between Mallampati score and presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea suggests that this scoring system will have practical value in clinical settings and prospective studies of sleep-disordered breathing.
Summary:","Mallampati scoring grades visibility of the posterior pharynx when the patient opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue. Visibility is ranked on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 representing the greatest visibility and 4 the least. Prospective multivariate assessment of Mallampati scores in adults referred to a sleep clinic yielded likelihood ratios of OSAHS for Mallampati grades 1 to 4 of 0.4, 0.7, 1.6, and 1.7, respectively."

Query 1: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 1: To investigate the relationship between breast-feeding and obesity in childhood. Systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies) comparing early feeding-mode and adjusting for potential confounding factors. Electronic databases were searched and reference lists of relevant articles were checked. Calculations of pooled estimates were conducted in fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was tested by Q-test. Publication bias was assessed from funnel plots and by a linear regression method. Odds ratio (OR) for obesity in childhood defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles. Nine studies with more than 69,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that breast-feeding reduced the risk of obesity in childhood significantly. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.78, 95% CI (0.71, 0.85) in the fixed model. The assumption of homogeneity of results of the included studies could not be refuted (Q-test for heterogeneity, P>0.3), stratified analyses showed no differences regarding different study types, age groups, definition of breast-feeding or obesity and number of confounding factors adjusted for. A dose-dependent effect of breast-feeding duration on the prevalence of obesity was reported in four studies. Funnel plot regression gave no indication of publication bias. Breast-feeding seems to have a small but consistent protective effect against obesity in children.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that 7 showed a significantly lower risk of overweight among children who were breastfed (odds ratio [OR]=0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.85). Four of the studies demonstrated that longer duration of breastfeeding offered greater protection than shorter duration. Two of the 4 studies defined longer duration as more than 6 months, 1 defined it as more than 3 months, and 1 examined breastfeeding for periods of less than 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 2 to 3 months, 4 to 6 months, 7 to 9 months, and longer than 9 months, showing a duration-dependent decrease in risk. The other studies in the meta-analysis evaluated never-breastfed vs ever-breastfed infants.

Query: How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant?
Document: Observational studies suggest a longer duration of breastfeeding to be associated dose dependently with a decrease in risk of overweight in later life. The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the existing studies on duration of breastfeeding and risk of overweight. Studies were included that reported the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (or the data to calculate them) of overweight associated with breastfeeding and that reported the duration of breastfeeding and used exclusively formula-fed subjects as the referent. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. By meta-regression, the duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with the risk of overweight (regression coefficient=0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 0.98). Categorical analysis confirmed this dose-response association (<1 month of breastfeeding: odds ratio (OR)=1.0, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.55; 1-3 months: OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.88; 4-6 months: OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86; 7-9 months: OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.82; >9 months: OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.91). One month of breastfeeding was associated with a 4% decrease in risk (OR=0.96/month of breastfeeding, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98). The definitions of overweight and age had no influence. These findings strongly support a dose-dependent association between longer duration of breastfeeding and decrease in risk of overweight.
Summary:","A meta-analysis showed a dose-dependent relationship between longer duration of breastfeeding and decreased risk of overweight in later life (<1 month of breastfeeding: odds ratio [OR]=1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.55; 1-3 months: OR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88; 4-6 months: OR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86; 7-9 months: OR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.82; >9 months: OR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91)."

Query 1: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 1: The association between obesity and morbidity resulting from chronic diseases is well known. This systematic review addresses studies of the role of rapid growth in infancy and childhood as possible determinants of overweight and obesity later in the life course. We reviewed MEDLINE for studies reporting on growth in infancy and childhood, as well as measures of weight or adiposity in later childhood, adolescence or adulthood. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed using the criteria suggested by Downs and Black. Sixteen articles that fulfilled review criteria were located. There was wide variability in the indicators used for defining rapid growth as well as overweight or obesity. The age range in which weight or adiposity was measured ranged from 3 to 70 years. In spite of differences in definitions used, 13 articles that reported on early rapid growth found significant associations with later overweight or adiposity. Efforts should be made to standardize the definition of rapid growth, as well as that of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. The most frequent definition for rapid growth in this review was a Z-score change greater than 0.67 in weight for age between two different ages in childhood. Regarding obesity, the definition proposed by the International Obesity Task Force also appears to be most appropriate. The present results indicate that early growth is indeed associated with the prevalence of obesity later in the life course.
Summary 1: One descriptive meta-analysis reported that 13 of 15 studies found a positive association between weight gain in the first year of life and overweight later in childhood, although overall odds ratio and relative risk were not reported.

Query: How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant?
Document: The evaluation of child growth trajectories and the interventions designed to improve child health are highly dependent on the growth charts used. The U.S. CDC and the WHO, in May 2000 and April 2006, respectively, released new growth charts to replace the 1977 NCHS reference. The WHO charts are based for the first time on a prescriptive, prospective, international sample of infants selected to represent optimum growth. This article compares the WHO and CDC curves and evaluates the growth performance of healthy breast-fed infants according to both. As expected, there are important differences between the WHO and CDC charts that vary by age group, growth indicator, and specific Z-score curve. Differences are particularly important during infancy, which is likely due to differences in study design and characteristics of the sample, such as type of feeding. Overall, the CDC charts reflect a heavier, and somewhat shorter, sample than the WHO sample. This results in lower rates of undernutrition (except during the first 6 mo of life) and higher rates of overweight and obesity when based on the WHO standards. Healthy breast-fed infants track along the WHO standard's weight-for-age mean Z-score while appearing to falter on the CDC chart from 2 mo onwards. Shorter measurement intervals in the WHO standards result in a better tool for monitoring the rapid and changing rate of growth in early infancy. Their adoption would have important implications for the assessment of lactation performance and the adequacy of infant feeding and would bring coherence between the tools used to assess growth and U.S. national guidelines that recommend breast-feeding as the optimal source of nutrition during infancy.
Summary:","The WHO growth curves (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/), rather than the CDC charts, should be used to monitor the growth of exclusively breastfed babies. The CDC charts reflect a heavier and shorter sample of infants. Moreover, the WHO charts are based on shorter measurement intervals and may therefore be a better tool for measuring rapidly changing rates of growth."

Query 2: What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women?
Document 2: To describe an organized diagnostic approach for both nonscarring and scarring alopecias to help family physicians establish an accurate in-office diagnosis. To explain when ancillary laboratory workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for hair loss are based on randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies, and case series. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 1998 with the MeSH words alopecia, hair, and alopecia areata. Articles were selected on the basis of experimental design, with priority given to the most current large multicentre controlled studies. Overall global evidence for therapeutic intervention for hair loss is quite strong. The most common forms of nonscarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata. Other disorders include trichotillomania, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, and hair shaft abnormalities. Scarring alopecia is caused by trauma, infections, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lichen planus. Key to establishing an accurate diagnosis is a detailed history, including medication use, systemic illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, hair-care practices, and family history. All hair-bearing sites should be examined. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp is useful, particularly to diagnose scarring alopecias. Once a diagnosis has been established, specific therapy can be initiated. Diagnosis and management of hair loss is an interesting challenge for family physicians. An organized approach to recognizing characteristic differential features of hair loss disorders is key to diagnosis and management.
Summary 2: A detailed history-including medication use, systemic illness, endocrine dysfunction, hair care practices, severe diet restriction, and family history-is key to establishing an accurate diagnosis of alopecia.

Query: When should you treat scabies empirically?
Document: In order to help primary health care (PHC) workers in developing countries in the care of common skin diseases, an algorithm for the management of pyoderma, scabies, superficial mycoses, contact dermatitis and referral of early leprosy cases (based on the identification of diseases through the presence of objective key signs, and on treatments by generic drugs) was elaborated. One thousand patients were seen by trained dermatologists, who established diagnoses and treatments; in addition, there was systematic recording of each key sign, according to the successive algorithm steps. We compared the diagnostics and treatments obtained for several combinations of diagnostic signs, with those of the dermatologists. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of defined combinations were high for pyoderma, scabies and superficial mycoses. Values were less exact for dermatitis and leprosy, but were considered sufficient for the level of health care targeted. The apportionment of treatments between the algorithm and the dermatological approaches was considered appropriate in more than 80% of cases; mismanagement was possible in 7% of cases, with few predictable harmful consequences. The algorithm was found satisfactory for the management of the dermatological priorities according to the standards required at the PHC level.
Summary:","The only study we found that investigated the sensitivity of clinical features in diagnosing scabies was done in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, the presence of diffuse itching, plus lesions in at least 2 locations typical with scabies or a household member with itch, had 100% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity for scabies infection. This study used the evaluation of a dermatologist as a gold standard. The authors propose that treatment based on clinical findings with or without microscopic confirmation is appropriate; however, it is not clear how these data translate to a primary care population with a lower prevalence of scabies."

Query 1: When should you treat scabies empirically?
Document 1: To investigate an outbreak of scabies in an inner-city teaching hospital, identify pathways of transmission, institute effective control measures to end the outbreak, and prevent future occurrences. Outbreak investigation, case-control study, and chart review. Large tertiary acute-care hospital. A patient with unrecognized Norwegian (crusted) scabies was admitted to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) service of a 940-bed acute-care hospital. Over 4 months, 773 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 204 patients were exposed to scabies. Of the exposed HCWs, 147 (19%) worked on the AIDS service. Risk factors for being infested with scabies among HCWs included working on the AIDS service (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 2.17-13.15) and being a nurse, physical therapist, or HCW with extensive physical contact with infected patients (OR, 4.5; CI95, 1.26-17.45). Aggressive infection control precautions beyond Centers for Disease Control and Prevention barrier and isolation recommendations were instituted, including the following: (1) early identification of infected patients; (2) prophylactic treatment with topical applications for all exposed HCWs; (3) use of two treatments 1 week apart for all cases of Norwegian scabies; (4) maintaining isolation for 8 days and barrier precautions for 24 hours after completing second treatment for a diagnosis of Norwegian scabies; and (5) oral ivermectin for treatment of patients who failed conventional therapy. HCWs with the most patient contact are at highest risk of acquiring scabies. Because HCWs who used traditionally accepted barriers while caring for patients with Norwegian scabies continued to develop scabies, we found additional measures were required in the acute-care hospital. HCWs with skin exposure to patients with scabies should receive prophylactic treatment. We recommend (1) using heightened barrier precautions for care of patients with scabies and (2) extending the isolation period for 8 days or 24 hours after the second treatment with a scabicide for those patients with Norwegian scabies. Oral ivermectin was well tolerated for treating patients and HCWs who failed conventional treatment. Finally, we developed a surveillance system that provides a ""barometric measure"" of the infection rate in the community. If scabies increases in the community, a tiered triage system is activated to protect against transmission among HCWs or hospital patients.
Summary 1: One case-control study, performed at a large tertiary-care teaching hospital, demonstrated that health care workers on a service having a patient with undiagnosed scabies were 5.3 times more likely to develop a pruritic rash than those in other units. Health care workers with more skin-to-skin contact with the patients (nurses, nursing students, and physical therapists) were 4.5 times more likely to develop scabies compared with those in less physical contact (physicians, medical students, and occupational therapists). Among the symptomatic health care workers, 17% of their household contacts developed scabies, too.

Query 2: What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts?
Document 2: Verrucae are a very common dermatological problem that can be both painful and bothersome to the individual as well as costly to the health care system. In some cases verrucae can be notoriously resistant to therapy. To determine the cure rate, side effect profile, and overall satisfaction with CO2 laser treatment of recalcitrant verrucae vulgaris. A retrospective survey was sent to over 200 patients who had resistant verrucae vulgaris treated with the carbon dioxide laser at The Toronto Hospital (Western Division) from 1989 to 1994. Results: Ninety-two complete responses were received. The overall cure rate was 64.1% at 12 months. There was no significant difference in cure rates between single compared to multiple warts (p = .824 Fisher's exact test). The duration of the wart being present showed no difference in cure rate (p = .801 Fisher's exact test). The location of the wart also had no influence on the cure rate (p = .433 Fisher's exact test). Overall, 71.7% of the patients were happy with the laser treatment and 85.7% would have it done again. The carbon dioxide laser is an effective treatment of resistant verrucae vulgaris.
Summary 2: The potential hazard of aerosolized virus particles from these therapies has not been evaluated.

Query 1: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document 1: We wanted to determine whether any treatment had been shown to reduce pain or disability from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common sequela of herpes zoster in elderly patients. We undertook a systematic review of English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments of PHN with evaluation periods longer than 24 hours. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library. We also searched reference lists of identified trials and reviews and contacted content experts. Two reviewers independently evaluated RCTs for methodologic quality and data extraction. Outcomes of primary focus were pain and quality of life. Twenty-seven RCTs met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Six trials of tricyclic antidepressants found evidence for clinically meaningful effects over 6 weeks. All other treatments were evaluated in no more than 2 trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Topical capsaicin 0.075%, gabapentin, and controlled-release oxycodone were shown to be effective, but the clinically meaningful benefit is difficult to quantify. Intrathecal methylprednisolone and possibly bupivacaine sympathetic blocks are helpful in refractory cases. Other treatments evaluated, including topical lidocaine, had no evidence or inconsistent evidence of benefit. No single best treatment for PHN is known. Tricyclic antidepressants, topical capsaicin, gabapentin, and oxycodone are effective for alleviating PHN; however, long-term, clinically meaningful benefits are uncertain and side effects are common. Patients with PHN refractory to these therapies may benefit from intrathecal methylprednisolone. Little evidence is available regarding treatment of PHN of less than 6 months' duration.
Summary 1: A systematic review found that controlled-release oxycodone reduced pain by 50%, based on the VAS.

Query 2: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document 2: A systematic review of the literature on postherpetic neuralgia was performed. The authors identified studies using the National Library of Medicine's Medline database and Cochrane Library database. The authors determined absolute reduction rate, number needed to treat (NNT), 95% CI for NNT, and number needed to harm (NNH) for successful therapies of postherpetic neuralgia. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine patch were found to be effective in reducing the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.
Summary 2: Capsaicin, a topical counterirritant, reduced pain in fewer than 20% of patients in 2 RCTs reported in systematic reviews, with an number needed to treat of 3.26 (95% CI, 2.26-5.85). Blinding was limited in these studies because of the stinging associated with treatment.

Query: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a complication of acute herpes zoster, which is emerging as a preferred clinical trial model for chronic neuropathic pain. Although there are published meta-analyses of analgesic therapy in PHN, and neuropathic pain in general, the evidence base has been substantially enhanced by the recent publication of several major trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for both efficacy and adverse events of analgesic therapy for PHN. We systematically searched databases (MEDLINE 1966-2004, EMBASE 1988-2004, CINAHL 1982-2002, and PubMed [29 October 2004]) for trials of PHN. We also searched references of retrieved studies and review articles for further trials. We included trials that examined adult patients with PHN of greater duration than 3 mo, that were blinded, randomised, and had at least one measure of pain outcome. Dichotomous pain outcome data were extracted for 50% decrease in baseline pain using a hierarchy of pain/pain-relief measurement tools. Where available, dichotomous data were also collected for adverse events. Calculated estimates of efficacy included relative benefit and number needed to treat. Of 62 studies identified, 35 were randomised controlled trials. Of these, 31 were placebo controlled and suitable for meta-analysis, from which it was possible to extract dichotomous efficacy outcome data from 25. This meta-analysis revealed that there is evidence to support the use of the following orally administered therapies: tricyclic antidepressants, ""strong"" opioids, gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Topical therapies associated with efficacy were lidocaine 5% patch and capsaicin. Finally, a single study of spinal intrathecal administration of lidocaine and methyl prednisolone demonstrated efficacy, although this has yet to be replicated. Data suggest that the following therapies are not associated with efficacy in PHN: certain NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., oral memantine, oral dextromethorphan, intravenous ketamine), codeine, ibuprofen, lorazepam, certain 5HT1 receptor agonists, and acyclovir. Topical administration of benzydamine, diclofenac/diethyl ether, and vincristine (iontophoresis) are similarly not associated with efficacy, nor are intrathecal administration of lidocaine alone or epidural administration of lidocaine and methylprednisolone, intravenous therapy with lidocaine, subcutaneous injection of Cronassial, or acupuncture. However, many of the trials that demonstrated a lack of efficacy represented comparatively low numbers of patient episodes or were single-dose studies, so it may be appropriate to regard such interventions as ""not yet adequately tested"" rather than demonstrating ""no evidence of efficacy."" Topical aspirin/diethyl ether has not been adequately tested. The evidence base supports the oral use of tricyclic antidepressants, certain opioids, and gabapentinoids in PHN. Topical therapy with lidocaine patches and capsaicin is similarly supported. Intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone appears to be associated with high efficacy, but its safety requires further evaluation.
Summary:","A Systematic Review concluded that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for PHN. Amitriptyline, the best studied TCA, provides at least moderate pain relief in two-thirds of patients with a pooled number needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs of 2.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.54). It found gabapentin to be effective, with a range of NNT from 2.8 to 5.3 for as much as 50% pain reduction based on the visual analog score (VAS)."

Query 1: What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy?
Document 1: To determine the relative efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the treatment of diabetic neuroapathy and postherpetic neuralgia, published reports were identified from a variety of electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and from two previously published reviews. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. The relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief was calculated from available dichotomous data, as was the relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-harm (NH) for minor adverse effects and drug related study withdrawal. In diabetic neuropathy, 16 reports compared antidepressants with placebo (491 patient episodes) and three compared anticonvulsants with placebo (321). The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief with antidepressants was 3.4 (95 % confidence interval 2.6-4. 7) and with anticonvulsants 2. 7 (2. 2-3. 8). In postherpetic neuralgia, three reports compared antidepressants with placebo (145 patient episodes) and one compared anticonvulsants with placebo (225), giving an NNT with antidepressants of 2.1 (1. 7-3) and with anticonvulsants 3.2 (2.4-5). There was little difference in the incidence of minor adverse effects with either antidepressants or anticonvulsants compared with placebo, with 1VH (minor) values of about 3. For drug-related study withdrawal, antidepressants had an NNH (major) of 17 (11-43) compared with placebo, whereas with anticonvulsants there was no significant difference from placebo. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants had the same efficacy and incidence of minor adverse effects in these tzoo neuropathic pain conditions. There was no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were better than older antidepressants, and no evidence that gabapentin was better than older anticonvulsants. In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.
Summary 1: Limited evidence suggests that SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo.

Query 2: Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain?
Document 2: Three previous reviews have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of antidepressants for patients with back pain. To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain. There is conflicting evidence whether antidepressants improve functional status of patients with chronic low back pain.
Summary 2: It appears that those with only SSRI activity are not effective improving chronic pain.

Query: What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia?
Document: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of The Cochrane Library. For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients. To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded. Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. This update includes 11 additional studies (778 participants). Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine. This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

Query 1: Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes?
Document 1: To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00271960 I.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials found no clinically or statistically significant differences in birth weights between intervention and control groups.

Query: Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes?
Document: To examine the impact of group versus individual prenatal care on birth weight and gestational age. This prospective, matched cohort study included pregnant women (N = 458) entering prenatal care at 24 or less weeks' gestation; one half received group prenatal care with women of the same gestational age. Women were matched by clinic, age, race, parity, and infant birth date. Women were predominantly black and Hispanic of low socioeconomic status, served by one of three public clinics in Atlanta, Georgia or New Haven, Connecticut. Birth weight was greater for infants of women in group versus individual prenatal care (P < .01). Among those born preterm, infants of group patients were significantly larger than infants of individual-care patients (mean, 2398 versus 1990 g, P < .05). Although not statistically significant, infants of group patients were less likely than those of individual-care patients to be low birth weight (less than 2500 g; 16 versus 23 infants); very low birth weight (less than 1500 g; three versus six infants); early preterm (less than 33 weeks; two versus seven infants); or to experience neonatal loss (none versus three infants). There were no differences in number of prenatal visits or other risk characteristics (patient age, race, prior preterm birth). Group prenatal care results in higher birth weight, especially for infants delivered preterm. Group prenatal care provides a structural innovation, permitting more time for provider-patient interaction and therefore the opportunity to address clinical as well as psychological, social, and behavioral factors to promote healthy pregnancy. Results have implications for design of sustainable prenatal services that might contribute to reduction of racial disparities in adverse perinatal outcomes.
Summary:",The matched cohort study recorded higher birth weights among infants born to mothers in group prenatal care. Subset analysis of preterm infants born to mothers in group care showed average birth weights approximately 400 g higher than those in individual care (P<.05).

Query 1: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 1: The association between early life factors and body mass index (BMI) in adulthood has been demonstrated in developed countries. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of early life factors (birth weight, gestational age, maternal smoking, and social class) on BMI in young adulthood with adjustment for adult socioeconomic position. A cohort study was carried out in 1978/79 with 6827 mother-child pairs from Ribeirão Preto city, located in the most developed economic area of the country. Biological, economic and social variables and newborn anthropometric measurements were obtained shortly after delivery. In 1996, 1189 males from this cohort, 34.3% of the original male population, were submitted to anthropometric measurements and were asked about their current schooling on the occasion of army recruitment. A multiple linear regression model was applied to determine variables associated with BMI. Mean BMI was 22.7 (95%CI = 22.5-23.0). After adjustment, BMI was 1.22 kg/m(2) higher among infants born with high birth weight ( > or = 4000 g), 1.21 kg/m(2) higher among individuals of low social class at birth and 0.69 kg/m(2) higher among individuals whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The association between social class at birth and BMI remained statistically significant (P < 0.05) even after adjustment for adult schooling. These findings suggest that early life social influences on BMI were more important and were not reversed by late socioeconomic position. Therefore, prevention of overweight and obesity should focus not only on changes in adult life styles but also on factors such as high birth weight.
Summary 1: A Brazilian study found that children born in the lowest socioeconomic group had body mass index measurements at 18 years of age that were an average of 1.21 kg/m2 higher than children in the highest socioeconomic group (P<.05). The study controlled for birth weight, maternal smoking, gestational age, and level of schooling eventually achieved by the child.

Query 2: Does birth weight predict childhood obesity?
Document 2: Obesity increases risk of many adverse outcomes, but its early origins are obscure. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) reflects a metabolically altered fetal environment associated with high birth weight, itself associated with later obesity. Previous studies of GDM and offspring obesity, however, have been few and conflicting. The objectives of this study were to examine associations of birth weight and GDM with adolescent body mass index (BMI) and to determine the extent to which the effect of GDM is explained by its influence on birth weight or by maternal adiposity. We conducted a survey of 7981 girls and 6900 boys, 9 to 14 years of age, who are participants in the Growing Up Today Study, a US nationwide study of diet, activity, and growth. In 1996, participants reported height, weight, diet, activity, and other variables by self-administered mailed questionnaire. We linked these data with information reported by their mothers, participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, including GDM, height, current weight, and child's birth weight. We excluded births <34 weeks' gestation and mothers who had preexisting diabetes. We defined overweight as BMI (kg/m(2)) >95th percentile, and at risk for overweight as 85th to 95th percentile, for age and gender from US national data. Mean birth weight was 3.4 kg for girls and 3.6 kg for boys. Among the 465 subjects whose mothers had GDM, 17.1% were at risk for overweight and 9.7% were overweight in early adolescence. In the group without maternal diabetes, these estimates were 14.2% and 6.6%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, gender, and Tanner stage, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight for each 1-kg increment in birth weight was 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.6). Adjustment for physical activity, television watching, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, mother's BMI, and other maternal and family variables reduced the estimate to 1.3 (1.1-1.5). For offspring of mothers with GDM versus no diabetes, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (1.1-2.0), which was unchanged after controlling for energy balance and socioeconomic factors. Adjustment for birth weight slightly attenuated the estimate (1.3; 0.9-1.9); adjustment for maternal BMI reduced the odds ratio to 1.2 (0.8-1.7). Higher birth weight predicted increased risk of overweight in adolescence. Having been born to a mother with GDM was also associated with increased adolescent overweight. However, the effect of GDM on offspring obesity seemed only partially explained by its influence on birth weight, and adjustment for mother's own BMI attenuated the GDM associations. Our results only modestly support a causal role of altered maternal-fetal glucose metabolism in the genesis of obesity in the offspring. Alternatively, GDM may program risk for a postnatal insult leading to obesity, or it may merely be a risk marker, not in the causal pathway.
Summary 2: A retrospective cohort survey of 14,881 children born to mothers with gestational diabetes-and controlled for age, sex, and Tanner stage-found that the odds ratio (OR) for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6) for each 1-kg increment in birth weight. The correlation persisted (OR=1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) when other covariates were controlled (television viewing, physical activity, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, birth order, household income, mother's smoking, dietary restraint, and mother's current BMI).

Query: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document: To identify factors in childhood which might influence the development of obesity in adulthood. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the UK and other developed countries, in adults and children. The adverse health consequences of adult obesity are well documented, but are less certain for childhood obesity. An association between fatness in adolescence and undesirable socio-economic consequences, such as lower educational attainment and income, has been observed, particularly for women. Childhood factors implicated in the development of adult obesity therefore have far-reaching implications for costs to the health-services and economy. In order to identify relevant studies, electronic databases--Medline, Embase, CAB abstracts, Psyclit and Sport Discus-were searched from the start date of the database to Spring 1998. The general search structure for electronic databases was (childhood or synonyms) AND (fatness or synonyms) AND (longitudinal or synonyms). Further studies were identified by citations in retrieved papers and by consultation with experts. Longitudinal observational studies of healthy children which included measurement of a risk factor in childhood (<18 y), and outcome measure at least 1 y later. Any measure of fatness, leanness or change in fatness or leanness was accepted. Measures of fat distribution were not included. Only studies with participants from an industrialized country were considered, and those concerning minority or special groups, e.g. Pima Indians or children born preterm, were excluded. Risk factors for obesity included parental fatness, social factors, birth weight, timing or rate of maturation, physical activity, dietary factors and other behavioural or psychological factors. Offspring of obese parent(s) were consistently seen to be at increased risk of fatness, although few studies have looked at this relationship over longer periods of childhood and into adulthood. The relative contributions of genes and inherited lifestyle factors to the parent-child fatness association remain largely unknown. No clear relationship is reported between socio-economic status (SES) in early life and childhood fatness. However, a strong consistent relationship is observed between low SES in early life and increased fatness in adulthood. Studies investigating SES were generally large but very few considered confounding by parental fatness. Women who change social class (social mobility) show the prevalence of obesity of the class they join, an association which is not present in men. The influence of other social factors such as family size, number of parents at home and childcare have been little researched. There is good evidence from large and reasonably long-term studies for an apparently clear relationship for increased fatness with higher birth weight, but in studies which attempted to address potential confounding by gestational age, parental fatness, or social group, the relationship was less consistent. The relationship between earlier maturation and greater subsequent fatness was investigated in predominantly smaller, but also a few large studies. Again, this relationship appeared to be consistent, but in general, the studies had not investigated whether there was confounding by other factors, including parental fatness, SES, earlier fatness in childhood, or dietary or activity behaviours. Studies investigating the role of diet or activity were generally small, and included diverse methods of risk factor measurement. There was almost no evidence for an influence of activity in infancy on later fatness, and inconsistent but suggestive evidence for a protective effect of activity in childhood on later fatness. No clear evidence for an effect of infant feeding on later fatness emerged, but follow-up to adulthood was rare, with only one study measuring fatness after 7y. Studies investigating diet in childhood were limited and inconc
Summary:",A meta-analysis found a positive association between birth weight and over-weight in childhood in 9 of 11 studies. This descriptive meta-analysis didn't calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) because of heterogeneity of the ages included and methods used to measure obesity.

Query 1: What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids?
Document 1: To determine the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Systematic review of common diagnostic imaging tests. Relevant papers were identified through electronic searching of MEDLINE (1980 to July 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2001) and manual searching of a bibliography of primary and review articles. Studies were selected if accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy was compared with a reference standard and included data that could be abstracted into a two-by-two table in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two independent reviewers. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios for all intrauterine pathologies, submucous fibroids and endometrial hyperplasia. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant heterogeneity was present between the likelihood ratios for studies of transvaginal ultrasound. A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7). A negative test result with hysteroscopy for diagnosing any intrauterine pathology had a pooled likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.04, 0.15). Although there was considerable variability present between the studies, all three diagnostic tests were moderately accurate in detecting intrauterine pathology. However, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy performed better than transvaginal ultrasound in detecting submucous fibroids.
Summary 1: In a systematic review of 7 studies, sonohysterography demonstrated a clinically significant LR+ of 29.7. There was too much heterogeneity in the data to calculate an LR-.

A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7). A negative test result with hysteroscopy for diagnosing any intrauterine pathology had a pooled likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.04, 0.15). Although there was considerable variability present between the studies, all three diagnostic tests were moderately accurate in detecting intrauterine pathology. However, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy performed better than transvaginal ultrasound in detecting submucous fibroids.
Summary:",A systematic review of 9 heterogeneous studies evaluating TVS found wide ranges for sensitivity and specificity.

Query 1: What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids?
Document 1: To evaluate saline infusion sonohysterography as an investigative modality in abnormal uterine bleeding in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Fifty-eight patients, 52 perimenopausal and six postmenopausal women, with abnormal uterine bleeding were selected from the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital. After complete work-ups, transvaginal examinations were performed followed by sonohysterographies. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values were calculated for transvaginal sonography (TVS) and saline infusion sonohysterography as compared with findings of hysteroscopy/hysterectomy. Saline infusion sonohysterography was performed in 56 cases. It could not be done in one perimenopausal and one postmenopausal woman. Cavity was normal in 41 perimenopausal and five postmenopausal women. Ten women displayed abnormalities. Two had submucosal fibroids, two had intramural fibroids, one had fibroid polyp, three had endometrial polyps and two patients had endometrial growths. We found that TVS missed three endometrial polyps and one endometrial growth and led to mislabeling two intramural fibroids as submucosal. On comparing the sonohysterographic findings with those of hysteroscopy or hysterectomy, one endometrial polyp and one endocervical polyp was missed on sonohysterography, and one false positive growth was observed on sonohysterography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of TVS were 84.8%, 79%, 82.4% and 82%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of saline infusion sonohysterography were 94.1%, 88.5%, 91.4% and 92%, respectively. Saline infusion sonohysterography is a safe, convenient, time conserving, cost effective, easily accessible and acceptable investigative modality. It definitely enhances the diagnostic potential of TVS in assessment of endometrium and intracavitary pathologies.
Summary 1: A prospective study of 56 symptomatic patients with a gold standard of hysteroscopic or surgical pathology similarly found sonohysterography to be superior to TVS.

Query 2: What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids?
Document 2: To assess whether sonohysterography provides added diagnostic value over transvaginal sonography in patients with suspected or known myomas by comparing diagnostic confidence, interobserver agreement, accuracy, and change in diagnoses when 2 independent observers interpreted transvaginal sonography alone and later interpreted transvaginal sonography and sonohysterography together. Hard copy images from 72 women were interpreted independently by 2 sonologists on separate occasions, rating parameters (abnormal uterus, myoma in any location, submucous myoma, classification of location of a submucous myoma with respect to the uterine cavity, myoma remote from the cavity, adenomyosis, and focal and diffuse endometrial lesions) on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 indicated definitely no; 2, probably no; 3, uncertain; 4, probably yes; and 5, definitely yes). Correlation was made with clinical and imaging follow-up, surgery, and pathologic examination. The added information provided by sonohysterography resulted in improved diagnostic confidence for most parameters. Interobserver agreement was markedly improved for the diagnosis and location of submucous myomas and focal endometrial lesions. Sensitivity values for submucous myomas and focal endometrial lesions were 100% and 90% for transvaginal sonography and sonohysterography together and 100% and 70% for transvaginal sonography alone. We found that sonohysterography does provide additional information over transvaginal sonography alone and is an important adjunct to transvaginal sonography in symptomatic women with known or suspected myomas, particularly before surgical or medical therapy.
Summary 2: Additional diagnostic testing is indicated for patients with suspected fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding, increased pelvic girth, pelvic pressure contributing to urinary frequency or constipation, or pelvic pain with intercourse or other physical activity.

Document 1: To determine the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Systematic review of common diagnostic imaging tests. Relevant papers were identified through electronic searching of MEDLINE (1980 to July 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2001) and manual searching of a bibliography of primary and review articles. Studies were selected if accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy was compared with a reference standard and included data that could be abstracted into a two-by-two table in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two independent reviewers. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios for all intrauterine pathologies, submucous fibroids and endometrial hyperplasia. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant heterogeneity was present between the likelihood ratios for studies of transvaginal ultrasound. A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7).

Query: What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids?
Document: To correlate the preoperative bimanual examination with ultrasound examination with regard to estimating the size of enlarged nongravid leiomyomatous uteri. We performed a retrospective review of 161 patients who underwent hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma between January 1994 and December 1994 and between July 1995 and April 1996. Uterine size was estimated clinically by bimanual examination. Ultrasound reports were reviewed. Uterine weights and dimensions in pathology reports were compared with findings on bimanual examination and ultrasonography. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and patients were divided into two groups, one with BMIs of more than 30 and another with BMIs of less than or equal to 30. Ultrasound examination was ordered in 111 patients (68.9%) preoperatively. There was a strong correlation between the bimanual examination findings and the ultrasound dimensions. The equation for this relationship is ultrasound length (cm)=3.68 + 0.68 x number of weeks (r=.78, P < .001). Ultrasound length also was related strongly to size given in the pathologic reports; the equation for this relationship is ultrasound length (cm)=2.94 + 0.75 x pathology length (cm) (r=.73, P < .001). The correlation between bimanual examination and ultrasound findings was similar in obese and in nonobese patients, when uterine size could be estimated. There is a strong correlation between bimanual and ultrasound examinations with regard to determining the size of leiomyomatous uteri. Routine ultrasound is not indicated when an experienced examiner can assess uterine size. Ultrasonography may be appropriate when physical assessment is difficult, as in the case of obesity.
Summary:","In a retrospective chart review of obese and nonobese patients with known uterine fibroids, clinical estimate of uterine size by bimanual examination correlated with both ultrasound fibroid sizing and posthysterectomy pathology analysis."

Query 1: What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin?
Document 1: Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.
Summary 1: Medical therapy with a dopamine agonist is indicated for patients with either symptoms of hypogonadism due to elevated SPL, or neurologic symptoms due to the size of a macroadenoma.

Summary:","An expert guideline recommends a history and physical examination to determine whether an elevated SPL is due to physiologic, pharmacologic, or pathologic causes. The fasting morning SPL is least variable and correlates best with a disease state. A detailed drug history is important since drug-induced elevated SPL is common.1 Laboratory evaluation includes thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, as well as pregnancy testing when applicable. If no cause of elevated SPL is identified by initial clinical evaluation or if the SPL is greater than 200 ng/mL, experts recommend imaging of the sella turcica with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging."

Query 1: What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin?
Document 1: Bromocriptine, a specific dopamine receptor agonist, has been used for the treatment of various hyperprolactinemic conditions and as adjunctive therapy for acromegaly (with or without concomitant hyperprolactinemia) and Parkinson's disease. Bromocriptine is extremely effective in suppressing prolactin secretion regardless of the cause, in restoring gonadal function and fertility, and in decreasing the size of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors. Most patients with acromegaly have clinical improvement with this drug. When bromocriptine is added to a regimen of levodopa or carbidopa, patients with Parkinson's disease frequently have additional clinical improvement and, in most patients, the levodopa or carbidopa dose can be reduced. Withdrawal of bromocriptine therapy is associated in most patients with reversal of its beneficial effects--return of hyperprolactinemia, return of excess growth hormone secretion, and exacerbation of Parkinson's disease.
Summary 1: In a review of 13 cohort studies, bromocriptine improved symptoms and reduced SPLs to normal for 229 of 280 women (82%).

Document 2: To assess the effectiveness of bromocriptine in reducing the size of PRL-secreting macroadenomas with extrasellar extension, we conducted a prospective multicenter trial in patients without prior radiotherapy, applying a standard protocol of treatment and tumor size evaluation. Basal serum PRL levels [1441 +/- 417 (+/- SEM) ng/ml for women; 3451 +/- 1111 ng/ml for men] fell in all patients and to 11% or less of basal values in all patients but 1. Normal PRL levels were reached in 18 of the 27 patients. In 13 patients (46%), tumor size was reduced by greater than 50%, in 5 patients (18%) by about 50%, and in 9 patients (36%) by approximately 10-25%. The extent of tumor size reduction did not correlate with basal PRL, nadir PRL, percent fall in PRL, or whether PRL levels reached normal. However, a reduction in PRL levels always preceded any detectable change in tumor size. In 19 patients, reduction in tumor size was evident by 6 weeks, but in the other 8, such reduction was not noted until the 6 month evaluation. In the 4 patients in whom bromocriptine was discontinued at the end of 1 yr, tumor reexpansion occurred in 3. Visual fields improved in 9 of the 10 patients in whom they were abnormal. Because of the excellent results found in most of the patients in this series, we suggest that therapy with bromocriptine should be considered as initial management for patients with PRL-secreting macroadenomas.
Summary 2: A cohort study of 27 patients with macroadenomas treated with bromocriptine found 10% to 50% reductions of tumor size.

Document: Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine-agonist drug that suppresses prolactin secretion and restores gonadal function in women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea. We designed a study to compare its safety and efficacy with those of bromocriptine, which has been the standard therapy. A total of 459 women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea were treated with either cabergoline (0.5 to 1.0 mg twice weekly) or bromocriptine (2.5 to 5.0 mg twice daily), administered in a double-blind fashion for 8 weeks and subsequently in an open fashion for 16 weeks, during which adjustments in the dose were made according to the response. Of the 459 women, 279 had microprolactinomas, 3 had macroprolactinomas, 1 had a craniopharyngioma, 167 had idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, and the remainder had an empty sella. Clinical and biochemical status was assessed at 2-week intervals for 8 weeks and monthly thereafter for a total of 6 months, with an additional assessment at 14 weeks. Stable normoprolactinemia was achieved in 186 of the 223 women treated with cabergoline (83 percent) and 138 of the 236 women treated with bromocriptine (59 percent, P < 0.001). Seventy-two percent of the women treated with cabergoline and 52 percent of those treated with bromocriptine had ovulatory cycles or became pregnant during treatment (P < 0.001). Amenorrhea persisted in 7 percent of the cabergoline-treated women and 16 percent of the bromocriptine-treated women. Adverse effects were recorded in 68 percent of the women taking cabergoline and 78 percent of those taking bromocriptine (P = 0.03); 3 percent discontinued taking cabergoline, and 12 percent stopped taking bromocriptine (P < 0.001) because of drug intolerance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly less frequent, less severe, and shorter-lived in the women treated with cabergoline. Cabergoline is more effective and better tolerated than bromocriptine in women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea.
Summary:","A randomized controlled trial treating 459 women having hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea with either cabergoline or bromocriptine achieved a stable normal SPL in 83% and 59%, respectively (P<.001). Adverse effects were common but were less common with cabergoline (68% vs 78%) and resulted in fewer discontinuations (3% vs 12%)."

Query 1: Which healthy adults should take aspirin?
Document 1: The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial. To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention. MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001). 1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use. One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 5 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials involving more than 50,000 patients free of coronary heart disease and stroke evaluated aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Since 3 of the trials excluded women, only 20% of the participants were female. The mean age of participants was 57 years. The treatment groups took aspirin 75 to 500 mg/d for 3 to 7 years. The meta-analysis found that compared with placebo, aspirin significantly reduced total coronary heart disease events (odds ratio [OR]=0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.87). Aspirin did not reduce coronary disease mortality (OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.70-1.09);.

Query 2: Which healthy adults should take aspirin?
Document 2: Aspirin therapy reduces stroke by about 25% for persons with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the effect in those without clinically apparent vascular disease is distinctly different. To define the effect of aspirin use on stroke and other major vascular events when given for primary prevention to persons without clinically recognized vascular disease. Systematic review of randomized clinical trials and large prospective observational cohort studies examining the relation between aspirin use and stroke in persons at low intrinsic risk. Studies were identified by a computerized search of the English-language literature. Five randomized trials of primary prevention included 52 251 participants randomized to aspirin doses ranging from 75 to 650 mg/d; the mean overall stroke rate was 0.3% per year during an average follow-up of 4.6 years. Meta-analysis revealed no significant effect on stroke (relative risk = 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.24) contrasting with a decrease in myocardial infarction (relative risk = 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.82). The lack of reduction of stroke by aspirin for primary prevention was incompatible with its protective effect against stroke in patients with manifest vascular disease (P = .001). Intracranial hemorrhage was increased by the regular use of aspirin (relative risk = 1.35; P = .03), similarly for both primary and secondary prevention. In 4 large observational studies, self-selected use of aspirin was consistently associated with higher rates of stroke. The effect of aspirin therapy on stroke differs between individuals based on the presence or absence of overt vascular disease, in contrast with the consistent reduction in myocardial infarction by aspirin therapy observed in all populations. We hypothesize that the effect of aspirin therapy on stroke for persons with major risk factors for vascular disease may be intermediate between a substantial decrease for those with manifest vascular disease and a possible small increase for healthy persons due to accentuated intracranial hemorrhage. When aspirin is given for primary prevention of vascular events, available data support using 75 to 81 mg/d.
Summary 2: Although the ideal aspirin dosage is uncertain, lower dosages (75-81 mg/d) have been shown to be as beneficial as higher dosages, and may have fewer bleeding complications. Buffered and entericcoated formulations are no more protective than plain aspirin.

Query 1: How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk?
Document 1: The goal of this study was to determine the influence of smoking cessation on mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), which has still not been established clearly. Cigarette smoking is one of the known major risk factors of coronary artery disease. One thousand and forty-one patients underwent CABG between 1971 and 1980. The preoperative and postoperative smoking habits of 985 patients (95%) could be retrieved and were analyzed in a multivariate Cox analysis. The median follow-up was 20 years (range 13 to 26 years). Smoking status before surgery did not entail an increased risk of mortality: patients who had smoked before surgery and those who had not smoked in the year before surgery had a similar probability of survival. However, smoking cessation after surgery was an important independent predictor of a lower risk of death and coronary reintervention during the 20-year follow-up when compared with patients who continued smoking. In analyses adjusted for baseline characteristics, the persistent smokers had a greater relative risk (RR) of death from all causes (RR 1.68 [95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.13]) and cardiac death (RR 1.75 [1.30 to 2.37]) as compared with patients who stopped smoking for at least one year after surgery. The estimated benefit of survival for the quitters increased from 3% at five years to 14% at 15 years. The quitters were less likely to undergo repeat CABG or a percutaneous coronary angioplasty procedure (RR 1.41 [1.02 to 1.94]). Patients who continued to smoke after CABG had a greater risk of death than patients who stopped smoking. They also underwent repeat revascularization procedures more frequently. Cessation of smoking is therefore strongly recommended after CABG. Clinicians are encouraged to start or to continue smoking-cessation programs in order to help smokers to quit smoking, especially after CABG.
Summary 1: A study found similar results at 20-year follow-up: Patients who had quit smoking underwent fewer repeat CABGs than smokers (RR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.94).8 The difference between post-CABG survival curves for quitters versus smokers increased from 3% at 5 years (98% vs 95%) to 15% at 15 years (70% vs 55%; P<.0001; NNT=6.7).

Query 2: What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension?
Document 2: The 356,222 men aged 35 to 57 years, who were free of a history of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, screened by the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in its recruitment effort, constitute the largest cohort with standardized serum cholesterol measurements and long-term mortality follow-up. For each five-year age group, the relationship between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) death rate was continuous, graded, and strong. For the entire group aged 35 to 57 years at entry, the age-adjusted risks of CHD death in cholesterol quintiles 2 through 5 (182 to 202, 203 to 220, 221 to 244, and greater than or equal to 245 mg/dL [4.71 to 5.22, 5.25 to 5.69, 5.72 to 6.31, and greater than or equal to 6.34 mmol/L]) relative to the lowest quintile were 1.29, 1.73, 2.21, and 3.42. Of all CHD deaths, 46% were estimated to be excess deaths attributable to serum cholesterol levels 180 mg/dL or greater (greater than or equal to 4.65 mmol/L), with almost half the excess deaths in serum cholesterol quintiles 2 through 4. The pattern of a continuous, graded, strong relationship between serum cholesterol and six-year age-adjusted CHD death rate prevailed for nonhypertensive nonsmokers, nonhypertensive smokers, hypertensive nonsmokers, and hypertensive smokers. These data of high precision show that the relationship between serum cholesterol and CHD is not a threshold one, with increased risk confined to the two highest quintiles, but rather is a continuously graded one that powerfully affects risk for the great majority of middle-aged American men.
Summary 2: A cohort study evaluating 356,222 men aged 35 to 57 years found a continuous, positive, graded correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and coronary risk.

Query: How much does smoking cessation cut CHD risk?
Document: To examine whether midlife cardiovascular risk factors predict survival and survival free of major comorbidities to the age of 85. Prospective community-based cohort study. Framingham Heart Study, Massachusetts. Two thousand five hundred thirty-one individuals (1,422 women) who attended at least two examinations between the ages of 40 and 50. Risk factors were classified at routine examinations performed between the ages of 40 and 50. Stepwise sex-adjusted logistic regression models predicting the outcomes of survival and survival free of morbidity to age 85 were selected from the following risk factors: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, glucose intolerance, cigarette smoking, education, body mass index, physical activity index, pulse pressure, antihypertensive medication, and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of the study sample survived to age 85, and 22% of the original study sample survived free of morbidity. Lower midlife blood pressure and total cholesterol levels, absence of glucose intolerance, nonsmoking status, higher educational attainment, and female sex predicted overall and morbidity-free survival. The predicted probability of survival to age 85 fell in the presence of accumulating risk factors: 37% for men with no risk factors to 2% with all five risk factors and 65% for women with no risk factors to 14% with all five risk factors. Lower levels of key cardiovascular risk factors in middle age predicted overall survival and major morbidity-free survival to age 85. Recognizing and modifying these factors may delay, if not prevent, age-related morbidity and mortality.
Summary:","The landmark prospective, community-based cohort Framingham Heart Study (N=1422), which indicates that smoking status predicts overall and morbidity-free survival at age 85."

Query 1: What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease?
Document 1: The natural history of untreated Osgood-Schlatter disease is presented in the retrospective study of 69 knees in 50 patients. Seventy-six percent of the patients believed they had no limitation of activity, although 60% still could not kneel without discomfort. Two groups of patients were identified: those who presented with radiologic fragmentation and had either separated ossicles or an abnormally ossified tuberosity at review, and those who presented with soft tissue swelling without radiologic fragmentation and were asymptomatic at review. There was a low incidence of patellar instability or anterior knee pain, and no case of premature proximal tibial epiphyseal arrest.
Summary 1: A retrospective review analyzed 50 patients with Osgood-Schlatter (69 knees) for an average of 9 years. No treatments or activity restrictions were recommended. At time of follow-up, 36 (76%) had no limitations, but kneeling continued to be uncomfortable in 60%.

Query 2: What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease?
Document 2: This report reflects the evolution of the operative treatment of Osgood-Schlatter's disease as practiced in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. In the earlier portion of the series patients were treated by drilling of the tibial tubercle with or without removal of the prominence (Group A--22 operations). In the latter portion of the series loose pieces of cartilage or bone were excised without removal of the prominent tubercle or drilling (Group B--22 operations). The results showed a much higher incidence of excellent or good results in Group B. These patients had a short simple operation followed by rapid mobilization and return to full activity. We would, therefore, recommend this procedure for those who have significant symptoms from osteochondritis of the tibial tubercle.
Summary 2: A case series compared 22 patients who1 underwent drilling of the tibial tubercle (with or without the removal of the tibial tubercle) with 22 patients who had excision of loose ossicles or cartilage. Seventeen of the 22 (77%) patients with ossicle excision had complete resolution of symptoms compared with 8 of the 22 (36%) in the patients who underwent tibial tubercle drilling.

Query: What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease?
Document: During the period of 1976 to 1981, a total of 412 young athletes contacted the Turku Sports Medical Research Unit's (TSMRU) Outpatient Sports Clinic with 586 complaints. These records included 68 athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease (OSD), who were initially prescribed an average of 2 months' rest from any physical activity causing pain. Symptoms of tibial tuberosity pain occurred first at the average age of 13.1 years. According to the retrospective questionnaire, the pain caused complete cessation of training for an average of 3.2 months, and the disease interfered with fully effective training for an average of 7.3 months. According to a retrospective questionnaire given to 389 students (191 girls and 198 boys), 50 (12.9%) had suffered from OSD. Nearly one-half of the students, 193 (49.6%), had been active in sports at the age of 13, and 41 (21.2%) of them had suffered from OSD. In those students who were not active in sports, the incidence was only nine (4.5%; P less than 0.001). The incidence (32%) was higher in the siblings of the OSD patients of TSMRU who were active in sports than in the corresponding student group (21.2%). In a group of 22 patients from the TSMRU who had suffered from Sever's disease (calcaneal apophysitis), the incidence of OSD (68%) was significantly higher than in students who were active in sports (P less than 0.001).
Summary:",One retrospective survey of 68 young athletes with Osgood-Schlatter found they required an average of 3.2 months off all training and 7.3 months of some activity restrictions.

Query 1: What is the most effective diagnostic evaluation of streptococcal pharyngitis?
Document 1: The frequency of obtaining false-negative Group A Streptococcal (GAS) rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests utilizing currently available kits in a private practice setting and the cost effectiveness of requiring follow-up throat cultures were studied. Laboratory records of the Elmwood Pediatric Group (EPG), Rochester, NY, were retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients with pharyngeal RAD tests for GAS performed from January 1996 through May 1999. From January 1996 through October 1997 (study period 1), EPG physicians used either a RAD test or a throat culture to identify GAS; from November 1997 through May 1999 (study period 2), RAD tests were used as the primary test on all patients. Rapid antigen detection test negative results were confirmed with culture. During the 3-year study 11,427 RAD tests were performed. 8,385 (73.4%) were negative and 3,042 (26.6%) were positive. In study period 1, 3,547 (73.2%) were negative and 1,299 (26.8%) were positive; in study period 2 4,837 (73.5%) were negative and 1,743 (26.5%) were positive. Of the 8,385 negative tests, 8,234 (98.2%) were followed up with throat cultures. Of these, 200 (2.4%) were identified to have been negative RAD tests that were throat culture positive (132 [3.8%] of 3,474 in study period 1 and 68 [1.4%] of 4,764 in study period 2). A cost analysis was performed for study period 2, which showed that abandoning throat culture confirmation would generate a cost saving of $13,521 per year to the practice. Throat culture confirmation of RAD test negative results in pharyngitis patients may not be medically necessary for most patients with currently available RAD tests and is costly.
Summary 1: In a retrospective review of rapid antigen detection testing, investigators performed 11,427 rapid antigen detection tests over 3 years in a private pediatric group. There were 8385 negative tests, among which follow-up cultures detected 200 (2.4%) that were positive for GABHS. In the second half of the study, a newer rapid antigen detection test produced a false-negative rate of 1.4%.

Query 2: Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep?
Document 2: We evaluated the efficacy of rifampin in eradicating chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. Carriers were defined as healthy children whose throat cultures showed persistence of group A streptococci 3 weeks after receiving benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly. Subsequent M and T typing of group A streptococcal isolates and limited serologic studies confirmed that enrolled patients were carriers. Thirty-eight carriers (37 completed the study) were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (13 patients) received no treatment; group 2 (10) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly; group 3 (14) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly plus rifampin orally (10 mg/kg twice a day for eight doses). Throat cultures were obtained every 3 weeks for at least 9 weeks. Group 2 and 3 patients who still had positive cultures 3 weeks after treatment were crossed to the opposite group. Cultures became negative in 93% (13 of 14) of patients in group 3, compared with 23% in group 1 and 30% in group 2 (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Including patients crossed over, the penicillin plus rifampin regimen was effective in 17 (89%) of 19 treatment courses and was significantly superior to no therapy or to penicillin alone (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.005, respectively). We conclude that rifampin plus benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is an effective regimen for those selected patients in whom eradication of group A streptococcal carriage is judged to be desirable.
Summary 2: A study found intramuscular penicillin plus 4 days of oral rifampin superior to intramuscular penicillin alone (P<.005) or no treatment at all (P<.0005) for eradicating group a streptococcal in carriers. Compared with placebo after 3 weeks of therapy, the number needed to treat for penicillin plus rifampin was 2.

Query: Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep?
Document: A 4-year longitudinal study of school-aged children was conducted to describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiologic features of infections with group A streptococci (GAS). Between 1998 and 2002, surveillance throat cultures were performed twice per month (October to May) for a cohort of elementary school children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, throat cultures were obtained during any respiratory illness. Erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibility testing was performed for all isolates. Molecular typing was performed with field-inversion gel electrophoresis. Representative isolates from each field-inversion gel electrophoresis group were emm typed. Strict definitions were used to characterize each GAS infection. Children were classified into 4 categories each year, ie, single episode, recurrent episodes, carriers of GAS, and no infections. A total of 48 to 100 children per year were studied for 4 years; 61 (49%) were male. The mean age was 9.6 years (range: 5-15 years). A total of 5658 throat cultures were performed; 878 (15.5%) were positive for GAS. Antimicrobial agents were used to treat 209 episodes of infection. Thirteen emm types were observed during the 4-year period. GAS were isolated most often from children who were carriers; isolates from single episodes were next most common. Children carried a single emm type for a mean of 10.8 weeks (range: 3-34 weeks). Carriers were likely to be classified again as carriers in subsequent years and frequently switched emm types. Sixty-two percent of the children had > or =1 year with no infections. GAS infections are common among school-aged children. The majority of positive throat cultures observed in this longitudinal study were obtained from children who were carriers of GAS. Carriers switched emm types but tended to become carriers repeatedly during the study. Practitioners should consider treating children known to be GAS carriers when they develop a new illness that is consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis, because they may acquire new emm types and be at risk for rheumatic heart disease.
Summary:","Some experts practicing in areas with a high prevalence of acute rheumatic fever take a different position: They favor routine treatment of patients with active pharyngitis and a positive throat culture, even if the patient is a known GAS carrier."

Query 2: Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective for recurrent acute otitis media?
Document 2: To determine the effectiveness of amoxicillin administered continuously twice daily vs. once daily vs. placebo to prevent new episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a hospital-based general pediatric clinic and a private pediatric practice, both in Denver, CO. One hundred ninety-four children (age 3 months through 6 years) were enrolled with 3 documented AOM episodes within the prior 6 months, without ventilating tubes or associated anatomic defects, immunodeficiency disorders or allergy to penicillin. Thirty-six were noncompliant and were excluded from the study, leaving 158 evaluable subjects. The amoxicillin dosage was 20 mg/kg/day either bid or qd. After randomization to placebo twice daily (bid), amoxicillin once daily (qd)/placebo qd or amoxicillin bid, patients were followed monthly and were also seen for upper respiratory infection symptoms during enrollment in the trial. Development of two new AOM episodes terminated the patients from the study. Incidence density (ID) measurements were calculated for all study subjects and were stratified by age and season. Overall study subjects in all 3 arms of the trial had 7243 days at risk during which time they developed 56 new AOM episodes for a annual ID of 2.82. There were no significant differences in the IDs between amoxicillin qd vs. bid or amoxicillin (bid or qd) vs. placebo. After stratifying by age and season of enrollment, there were no significant differences in ID rates among the 3 groups. The proportion of subjects remaining otitis-free was 63% for the placebo group, 64% for once daily amoxicillin and 61% for twice daily amoxicillin. While once-a-day dosing was equivalent to twice-a-day dosing for amoxicillin prophylaxis, there was no benefit of amoxicillin prophylaxis compared with a placebo control in preventing new AOM episodes. Because of the potential of excessive antibiotic use to promote the acquisition of resistant pneumococci and the lack of effectiveness in this trial, routine use of amoxicillin prophylaxis should be discouraged.
Summary 2: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of prophylaxis for ear infections enrolled 194 children aged 3 months to 6 years with at least 3 documented acute otitis media episodes in the preceding 6 months. The children were given amoxicillin (20 mg/kg/d) either once daily (n=55) or divided twice daily (n=44) or placebo (n=59). Excluding 36 noncompliant subjects, the percentages without a recurrent episode were 63% for the placebo group, 64% for the once-daily amoxicillin group, and 61% for the twice-daily amoxicillin group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new acute otitis media episodes among the children in the 3 groups.

Thirty-eight carriers (37 completed the study) were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (13 patients) received no treatment; group 2 (10) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly; group 3 (14) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly plus rifampin orally (10 mg/kg twice a day for eight doses). Throat cultures were obtained every 3 weeks for at least 9 weeks. Group 2 and 3 patients who still had positive cultures 3 weeks after treatment were crossed to the opposite group. Cultures became negative in 93% (13 of 14) of patients in group 3, compared with 23% in group 1 and 30% in group 2 (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Including patients crossed over, the penicillin plus rifampin regimen was effective in 17 (89%) of 19 treatment courses and was significantly superior to no therapy or to penicillin alone (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.005, respectively). We conclude that rifampin plus benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is an effective regimen for those selected patients in whom eradication of group A streptococcal carriage is judged to be desirable.
Summary:",As many as 25% of patients with GAS pharyngitis remain culture-positive after an adequate regimen of antibiotic therapy and are deemed GAS carriers. Appropriate screening and management of asymptomatic carriers continues to cause confusion.

Query 1: Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep?
Document 1: We evaluated the efficacy of rifampin in eradicating chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. Carriers were defined as healthy children whose throat cultures showed persistence of group A streptococci 3 weeks after receiving benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly. Subsequent M and T typing of group A streptococcal isolates and limited serologic studies confirmed that enrolled patients were carriers. Thirty-eight carriers (37 completed the study) were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (13 patients) received no treatment; group 2 (10) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly; group 3 (14) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly plus rifampin orally (10 mg/kg twice a day for eight doses). Throat cultures were obtained every 3 weeks for at least 9 weeks. Group 2 and 3 patients who still had positive cultures 3 weeks after treatment were crossed to the opposite group. Cultures became negative in 93% (13 of 14) of patients in group 3, compared with 23% in group 1 and 30% in group 2 (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Including patients crossed over, the penicillin plus rifampin regimen was effective in 17 (89%) of 19 treatment courses and was significantly superior to no therapy or to penicillin alone (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.005, respectively). We conclude that rifampin plus benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is an effective regimen for those selected patients in whom eradication of group A streptococcal carriage is judged to be desirable.
Summary 1: A study found intramuscular penicillin plus 4 days of oral rifampin superior to intramuscular penicillin alone (P<.005) or no treatment at all (P<.0005) for eradicating group a streptococcal in carriers. Compared with placebo after 3 weeks of therapy, the number needed to treat for penicillin plus rifampin was 2.

Query 2: How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics?
Document 2: To test whether oral or vaginal lactobacillus can prevent vulvovaginitis after antibiotic treatment. Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, factorial 2x2 trial. Fifty general practices and 16 pharmacies in Melbourne, Australia. Non-pregnant women aged 18-50 years who required a short course of oral antibiotics for a non-gynaecological infection: 278 were enrolled in the study, and results were available for 235. Lactobacillus preparations taken orally or vaginally, or both, from enrollment until four days after completion of their antibiotic course. Participants' reports of symptoms of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis, with microbiological evidence of candidiasis provided by a self obtained vaginal swab. Overall, 55/235 (23% (95% confidence interval 18% to 29%)) women developed post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis. Compared with placebo, the odds ratio for developing post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis with oral lactobacillus was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.94) and with vaginal lactobacillus 1.38 (0.75 to 2.54). Compliance with antibiotics and interventions was high. The trial was terminated after the second interim analysis because of lack of effect of the interventions. Given the data at this time, the chances of detecting a significant reduction in vulvovaginitis with oral or vaginal lactobacillus treatment were less than 0.032 and 0.0006 respectively if the trial proceeded to full enrollment. The use of oral or vaginal forms of lactobacillus to prevent post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis is not supported by these results. Further research on this subject is unlikely to be fruitful, unless new understandings about the pathogenesis of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis indicate a possible role for lactobacillus.
Summary 2: A recent randomized controlled trials of 278 women on short courses of antibiotics were randomized to oral lactobacilli or placebo and vaginal lactobacilli or placebo. The study was stopped early because there was no effect seen. Overall, 23% developed symptomatic vulvovaginitis.

Query: Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep?
Document: We previously demonstrated that chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) can be terminated by intramuscular administration of benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin. Because an effective oral regimen would be desirable, we compared clindamycin with P + R for treating GABHS carriage. Healthy, symptom-free GABHS carriers were randomly assigned to receive orally administered clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day) three times a day for 10 days or intramuscularly administered benzathine penicillin with oral doses of rifampin (20 mg/kg per day) twice a day for 4 days. Compliance was documented by antibiotic activity in urine. Throat cultures for GABHS were obtained every 3 weeks for up to 9 weeks after treatment. Patients who had positive throat cultures for their original GABHS T type 3 weeks after randomization were crossed over to the other treatment. Treatment success was defined as eradication of the original GABHS T type, with all follow-up cultures negative. Clindamycin eradicated carriage in 24 (92%) of 26 patients; penicillin plus rifampin was effective in 12 (55%) of 22 patients (p less than 0.025). Including patients crossed over 3 weeks after enrollment, clindamycin was effective in 28 (85%) of 33 treatment courses compared with 12 of 22 courses of penicillin plus rifampin (p less than 0.05). We conclude that 10 days of oral clindamycin therapy was significantly more effective than benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin for treatment of symptom-free GABHS carriers.
Summary:","A study demonstrated a significantly greater eradication rate with oral clindamycin than penicillin plus rifampin (P<.025). Compared with penicillin plus rifampin after 3 weeks of therapy, the number needed to treat (NNT) for clindamycin was 4."

Query 1: How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics?
Document 1: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common causes of vaginitis, and its incidence has increased markedly during the past three decades. The widespread overuse of antibiotics has been suggested as one of the major factors contributing to the increasing incidence of VVC. However, evidence supporting this association has been limited because few studies with rigorous scientific methodology have been conducted. Moreover, existing data regarding the risk for developing VVC after antibiotic use are conflicting. This review examines the available information in the literature regarding antibiotic-associated VVC, its incidence, and its potential mechanisms. Implications for clinical practice and research are also discussed.
Summary 1: A 2003 systematic review found the evidence supporting the association between antibiotics and vulvovaginal candidiasis limited and contradictory. Most were case-control or cohort studies with small sample sizes. No RCTs compare the incidence of culture-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis among women receiving antibiotics or placebo. Nineteen reports of 18 original studies had sufficient data to calculate a relative risk or odds ratio for antibiotic-associated VVC. Thirteen of the 19 reports showed an increase (around twofold; range, 0.43-5) in vaginal Candida prevalence; however, 3 of the 13 reports had no mycological culture data. Six studies did not show significant association between antibiotics and vaginal yeast.

Query 2: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 2: Toenail onychomycosis is a challenge for clinicians to treat, and this challenge is compounded by conflicting information in the medical literature concerning the efficacy of the two principal agents used in its treatment: terbinafine and itraconazole. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of terbinafinewith that of itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. A Medline search was performed for all English language publications from 1966 to June 1999 on the use of terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Included were randomized studies in which subjects received no less than 3 months (or cycles) and no more than 4 months (or cycles) of either terbinafine or itraconazole. Data were abstracted and statistical analyses (random effects model, fixed effects model, and Peto's method) were applied. Thirteen studies were included from the original literature review of 1636 total referenced reports; four studies did not fulfill our inclusion or exclusion criteria. The primary analysis of six studies directly comparing terbinafine to itraconazole resulted in an odds ratio ranging from 1.8 (95% CI = 1.8, 2.8) to 2.9 (1.9, 4.1). The secondary analysis of three studies comparing either itraconazole or terbinafine to placebo estimated an odds ratio of 1.1-1.7. The former shows that terbinafine is 80%-190% more likely to result in mycologic cure than is itraconazole; the latter demonstrates a 10%-70% greater likelihood. The difference between the relative efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Meta-analysis of the published worldwide literature finds that terbinafine is significantly more effective than itraconazole at achieving mycologic cure of toenail onychomycosis.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 6 studies comparing terbinafine with itraconazole reported odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8) to 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.1), indicating an 80% to 190% increased likelihood of clinical cure with terbinafine compared with itraconazole.

Query: How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics?
Document: Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush). The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals. The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted. ~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure. Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results. Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported. No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.
Summary:","For the treatment of uncomplicated VVC, both topical and oral antifungals are clinically and mycologically effective, with comparable clinical cure rates >80%. No difference in persistent symptoms between single and multiple doses, or different durations of multiple dose regimens have been found, but samples may have been too small to detect clinically significant effects. An RCT found less nausea, headache, and abdominal pain with intravaginal imidazoles, but more vulvar irritation and vaginal discharge than oral fluconazole."

Query 2: What is the best approach for managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis?
Document 2: Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcome and, in particular, preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences. To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2002). Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Ten trials involving 4249 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.24, eight trials of 3825 women). Treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, eight trials of 4062 women), 34 weeks (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.07, five trials of 851 women), or 32 weeks (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.68, three trials of 3080 women). However, antibiotic treatment did significantly decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, three trials of 562 women). In women with a previous preterm birth, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent preterm birth (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17, five trials of 622 women) but it did decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38, two trials of 114 women) and low birthweight (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, five trials of 622 women). Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. However, the current evidence does not support screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth and its consequences. For women with a previous preterm birth, there is little suggestion that detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis will prevent a further preterm birth, but it may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.
Summary 2: The CDC reviewers identified causal relationships between bacterial vaginosis and plasmacell endometritis, postpartum fever, and posthysterectomy vaginal-cuff cellulitis. They therefore concluded it is reasonable to try to prevent post-procedure infections by treating women who have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis before hysterectomy or pregnancy termination. Although bacterial vaginosis has been associated with preterm labor, trials evaluating treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm delivery are conflicting. A Cochrane review of bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor suggests treating women at high risk for preterm birth may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.

Query: How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics?
Document: Alterations in the autochthonous vaginal microflora can predispose women to recurring attacks of Candida vaginitis. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from 24 premenopausal women with acute recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and from 21 healthy asymptomatic premenopausal women. Lactobacillus species constituted the predominant flora in both groups, with a mean log10 CFU/ml of 8.7, a total isolation rate of 96%, and a mean of 1.6 Lactobacillus species isolated per patient compared with a mean log10 CFU/ml of 8.9, a total isolation rate of 90%, and a mean of 1.2 Lactobacillus species isolated per patient in the vaginitis and control groups, respectively. The results of this small study failed to provide evidence of an altered or abnormal vaginal bacterial flora in women with non-antibiotic-induced recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis suffering from acute Candida vaginitis.
Summary:",There is evidence that numbers of genital Lactobacillus are similar for women with and without symptomatic VVC.

Query 1: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 1: Premature ejaculation/rapid ejaculation is a common but incompletely understood male sexual dysfunction. The purposes of this review are to 1) raise awareness of the prevalence and characteristics of PE/RE, its impact on the male and his partner, and the lack of approved medications indicated for its treatment, 2) encourage dialogue about PE/RE between physicians and patients, and 3) stimulate the development of appropriate new therapies. A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles relating to PE/RE pathophysiology, etiology, impact, diagnosis and treatment. Sexual medicine journals not indexed in MEDLINE, sexual medicine texts and congress abstracts were also reviewed. No universally accepted definition, licensed treatment, validated screening instrument or diagnostic criteria have been established for PE/RE, and its pathophysiology and etiology are incompletely understood. Additional barriers are the reluctance of patients and physicians to talk about PE/RE and the lack of knowledge regarding available treatments. Current pharmacological treatments include off label uses of antidepressants, topical anesthetics or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. All are associated with drawbacks that limit their efficacy. Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy have a valuable role, although resources for this modality are limited. Prevalence rates of 20% to 30% and negative effects on the quality of life of men and their partners illustrate the need for improved, standardized methods of PE/RE diagnosis, assessment and treatment. Medications indicated specifically for PE/RE and effective on an as needed basis are required. Behavioral therapies should emphasize pleasure, arousal, control, confidence and satisfaction, and they may have the best success when coupled with pharmacological approaches.
Summary 1: Premature ejaculation is the most common male sexual dysfunction, but there is no universally accepted definition or validated screening instrument. The pathophysiology and etiology remain incompletely understood. Based on surveys, prevalence rates for premature ejaculation are approximately 20% to 30%.

Query 2: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 2: Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common ejaculatory dysfunction. We assessed the efficacy of sildenafil to increase the time to ejaculation, improve ejaculatory control, and decrease the postejaculatory erectile refractory time in men with PE. The main study was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in men between 18 and 65 years of age with diagnosed PE. A substudy was also conducted using a subset of patients (two-way crossover, one center) before entry to the main study. The primary study measured intravaginal ejaculatory latency (IELT) and responses to the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) questionnaire. The substudy measured vibrotactile stimulation ejaculatory latency time (VTS-ELT) and postejaculatory erectile refractory time. Differences between treatment groups were determined by ancova at the 5% level of significance. The change in IELT (1.6 +/- 6.08 vs. 0.6 +/- 2.07 minutes) and VTS-ELT (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.4 minutes) were higher after taking sildenafil, compared with placebo, but did not reach statistical significance. However, patients who took sildenafil (vs. placebo) reported significantly (P < 0.05) increased ejaculatory control (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3), increased ejaculatory confidence (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2), and improved overall sexual satisfaction scores (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 02) on the IPE, and had a decreased postejaculatory erectile refractory time (3.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.7 minutes). The most common adverse events for sildenafil (vs. placebo) were headache (15% vs. 1%), flushing (15% vs. 0%), dyspepsia (5% vs. 1%), abnormal vision (5% vs. 0%), and rhinitis (5% vs. 0%). Although IELT and VTS-ELT were not significantly improved, sildenafil increased confidence, the perception of ejaculatory control, and overall sexual satisfaction, and decreased the refractory time to achieve a second erection after ejaculation in men with PE.
Summary 2: One randomized controlled trials found no increase in IELT from baseline in men taking sildenafil when compared with placebo, although patients reported overall sexual satisfaction and confidence based on a questionnaire.

Query: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate whether the design and methodology of drug-treatment studies of premature ejaculation affect the efficacy outcome differently. Therefore, methodological, design and efficacy data from 79 studies (3034 males), published between 1943 and 2003, are reviewed. A meta-analysis is performed on 43 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine studies (1514 males), published between 1973 and 2003; these studies were pooled to provide a summary variance-weighted effect size. The antidepressant-induced percentage increase of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was calculated and examined against various methodological items. A significant difference in efficacy between SSRIs was observed. Using daily treatment, paroxetine appeared more effective than the other SSRIs. Retrospective use of a questionnaire, subjective reports, single-blind and open study designs generate far greater variability of ejaculation time both at baseline and during active drug treatment than real time assessment by stopwatch. In conclusion, at daily treatment, the overall efficacy of paroxetine, clomipramine, sertraline and fluoxetine is comparable, but paroxetine exerts the strongest ejaculation delay. Only eight (18.5%) studies on antidepressant treatment fulfilled all criteria used in evidence-based medicine, for example, randomised, double-blind studies with prospective real time (stopwatch) assessment of the IELT at each intercourse. Single-blind studies, open designs, retrospective reporting, or the use of a questionnaire to assess ejaculation time should be avoided.
Summary:",Certain SSRIs and the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil) have become the agents of choice for the treatment of premature ejaculation.

Query 1: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 1: To assess the use of a topical anaesthetic mixture to improve premature ejaculation (PE), for which penile hypersensitivity might be a cause. The study included 42 men divided in two groups; group A used a lidocaine-prilocaine solution and group B used an inert cream. The tubes of cream were distributed randomly and participants asked to note any unpleasant symptoms, difficulties and the results of each attempt at intercourse, assessed by the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). There was a significant increase in the mean (sd) IELT, from 1.49 (0.9) to 8.45 (0.9) min (P < 0.001) in group A but not in group B, at 1.67 (0.7) to 1.95 (0.12) min (P > 0.05). We suggest that anaesthetic cream might be effective for treating PE.
Summary 1: One double-blinded randomized controlled trials (N=29) showed significant improvement in the IELT (measured by stopwatch by the subject's partner) from baseline compared with placebo (8.45 min vs 1.95 min; P<.001) at 2 months.

Query 2: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 2: Premature ejaculation has generally been considered a psychosexual disorder with psychogenic aetiology. Although still mainly treated by behavioural therapy, in recent years double-blind studies have indicated the beneficial effects of some of the serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) in delaying ejaculation. We describe here the neurophysiology and the peripheral neuroanatomy of ejaculation and provide a review of the involvement of serotonin in the central nervous system in relation to serotonergic nuclei and their projections. A hypothesis of the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in premature ejaculation is postulated.
Summary 2: It's been suggested that lifelong premature ejaculation is a neurobiological phenomenon related to decreased central serotonergic neurotransmission, 5-HT2c receptor hyposensitivity, or 5-HT1a receptor hypersensitivity.

Query: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document: Premature ejaculation is a common male sexual disorder in which orgasm and ejaculation occur before the desired moment. The primary therapeutic approach to premature ejaculation has been behavioural and pharmacotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and optimum usage of lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% in preventing premature ejaculation. Forty patients were examined in the study group and randomized into four groups, each comprising 10 patients. Patients in group 1 applied lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% for 20 min, the patients in group 2 applied it for 30 min, and the patients in group 3 applied the cream for 45 min before sexual contact, with all patients covering the penis with a condom. Patients in the fourth group applied a base cream as placebo. In group 1, the pre-ejaculation period increased to 6.71 +/- 2.54 min without any adverse effects. In group 2, although the pre-ejaculation period increased in four patients up to 8.70 +/- 1.70 min, six patients in this group and all patients in group 3 had erection loss because of numbness. In the placebo group, there was no change in their pre-ejaculation period. Therefore, lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 min of application time before sexual contact is the optimum period.
Summary:","One small RCT (N=24) compared placebo with the application of EMLA cream 20, 30, and 45 minutes prior to sexual intercourse. Improvement was seen in IELT in the 20- and 30-minute group, but penile numbness and erection loss increased in the 30- and 45-minute group."

The change in IELT (1.6 +/- 6.08 vs. 0.6 +/- 2.07 minutes) and VTS-ELT (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.4 minutes) were higher after taking sildenafil, compared with placebo, but did not reach statistical significance. However, patients who took sildenafil (vs. placebo) reported significantly (P < 0.05) increased ejaculatory control (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3), increased ejaculatory confidence (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2), and improved overall sexual satisfaction scores (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 02) on the IPE, and had a decreased postejaculatory erectile refractory time (3.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.7 minutes). The most common adverse events for sildenafil (vs. placebo) were headache (15% vs. 1%), flushing (15% vs. 0%), dyspepsia (5% vs. 1%), abnormal vision (5% vs. 0%), and rhinitis (5% vs. 0%). Although IELT and VTS-ELT were not significantly improved, sildenafil increased confidence, the perception of ejaculatory control, and overall sexual satisfaction, and decreased the refractory time to achieve a second erection after ejaculation in men with PE.
Summary 1: One randomized controlled trials found no increase in IELT from baseline in men taking sildenafil when compared with placebo, although patients reported overall sexual satisfaction and confidence based on a questionnaire.

Query 2: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 2: Premature ejaculation has generally been considered a psychosexual disorder with psychogenic aetiology. Although still mainly treated by behavioural therapy, in recent years double-blind studies have indicated the beneficial effects of some of the serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) in delaying ejaculation. We describe here the neurophysiology and the peripheral neuroanatomy of ejaculation and provide a review of the involvement of serotonin in the central nervous system in relation to serotonergic nuclei and their projections. A hypothesis of the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in premature ejaculation is postulated.
Summary 2: It's been suggested that lifelong premature ejaculation is a neurobiological phenomenon related to decreased central serotonergic neurotransmission, 5-HT2c receptor hyposensitivity, or 5-HT1a receptor hypersensitivity.

Query: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document: This review examines the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a neurotransmitter involved in the central and peripheral control of ejaculation, the methods of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I) drug treatment studies for premature ejaculation (PE), the adherence of methods to the contemporary consensus of ideal PE drug trial design, the impact of methods on treatment outcomes and the role of PDE5Is in the treatment of PE. NO/cGMP transduction is involved in both the central and peripheral control of emission, but evidence for a direct central or peripheral effect of PDE5Is on ejaculation is speculative. Thirteen of the 14 studies reviewed failed to fulfil the evidence-based medicine criteria for ideal PE drug trial design. Limitations of the studies include inadequately defined study populations, the lack of a double-blind placebo-controlled study design, and the absence of consistent objective physiological measures or sensitive, validated outcome assessment instruments as study endpoints. The broad range of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) fold-increases reported with PDE5Is, on-demand selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, and combined PDE5I/on-demand SSRIs is testament to the unreliability of data and conclusions from methodologically flawed studies. The one study that fulfilled the evidence-based medicine criteria of an ideal clinical trial design reported that treatment with sildenafil failed to significantly increase baseline IELT, supporting our conclusion that there is no convincing evidence to support any role for PDE5Is in the treatment of men with lifelong PE and normal erectile function. However, there is limited evidence to support a potential role for PDE5Is alone or combined with daily or on-demand SSRIs in the treatment of acquired PE in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction. Further controlled studies adhering to the contemporary consensus of ideal clinical trial design are required to clarify the role of PDE5Is in this subgroup of men with acquired PE.
Summary:",A review of 14 clinical trials concluded that there is no convincing evidence for PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of men with lifelong premature ejaculation and normal erectile function.

Query 2: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document 2: Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common ejaculatory dysfunction. We assessed the efficacy of sildenafil to increase the time to ejaculation, improve ejaculatory control, and decrease the postejaculatory erectile refractory time in men with PE. The main study was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in men between 18 and 65 years of age with diagnosed PE. A substudy was also conducted using a subset of patients (two-way crossover, one center) before entry to the main study. The primary study measured intravaginal ejaculatory latency (IELT) and responses to the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) questionnaire. The substudy measured vibrotactile stimulation ejaculatory latency time (VTS-ELT) and postejaculatory erectile refractory time. Differences between treatment groups were determined by ancova at the 5% level of significance. The change in IELT (1.6 +/- 6.08 vs. 0.6 +/- 2.07 minutes) and VTS-ELT (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.4 minutes) were higher after taking sildenafil, compared with placebo, but did not reach statistical significance.

Document: 8-Methoxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OMe-DPAT) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) are two new drugs exerting selective actions on brain 5-HT neurotransmission. In the present experiments we have investigated the effects of these two drugs on male rat sexual behavior. It was found that both drugs reduce the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation and shorten the ejaculation latency. These effects are extremely pronounced and several animals ejaculate at the first intromission. In addition 8-OH-DPAT produced a slight reduction of the post-ejaculatory interval. There were no significant effects on latency to initiate copulation or in the number of mounts preceding ejaculation. Finally, sexual behavior was partly or completely restored in castrated male rats after injection with 8-OMe-DPAT or 8-OH-DPAT.
Summary:",Studies in male rats have demonstrated that serotonin with various 5-HT receptor subtypes are involved in the ejaculatory process.

Query: What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation?
Document: The introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has revolutionized our understanding of the treatment of premature ejaculation. Lifelong premature ejaculation may be a neurobiological phenomenon, namely part of a biological variability of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time in men. Animal studies support this view, and an animal model for premature and delayed ejaculation has recently been developed. It is proposed that drug treatment of premature ejaculation should consist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2c receptor stimulation and/or 5-HT1A receptor inhibition. A meta-analysis of 35 daily treatment studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine demonstrated comparable efficacy of clomipramine with the SSRIs sertraline and fluoxetine in delaying ejaculation, whereas the efficacy of the SSRI paroxetine was greater than all other SSRIs and clomipramine. It is postulated that acute treatment with SSRIs, including those with short half-lives, will not produce an ejaculation delay equivalent to that induced by daily treatment of SSRIs.

Query 1: What are effective medical treatments for adults with acute migraine?
Document 1: Many therapies are used in the treatment of acute migraine headache, with little agreement on effectiveness. This systematic review is designed to determine the effectiveness of parenteral dihydroergotamine in reducing pain, nausea, and relapse for episodes of acute migraine in adults. Randomized controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, hand searching, bibliographies, and contacts with industry and authors. Studies in which dihydroergotamine (alone or in combination with an antiemetic) was compared with placebo or any other common migraine therapy were considered. Relevance, inclusion, and study quality were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. From 281 potentially relevant abstracts, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Solitary dihydroergotamine use was compared to sumatriptan and phenothiazines in 3 studies; results failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of dihydroergotamine over these therapies. In 8 combination treatment studies, heterogeneity in study methodology prevented statistical pooling. However, dihydroergotamine administered with an antiemetic was as effective as or more effective than meperidine, valproate, or ketorolac across all pain, nausea, and relapse outcomes reported in all studies. This evidence suggests that dihydroergotamine is not as effective as sumatriptan or phenothiazines as a single agent for treatment of acute migraine headache; however, when administered with an antiemetic, dihydroergotamine appears to be as effective as opiates, ketorolac, or valproate. Given its nonnarcotic properties, parenteral dihydroergotamine combined with an antiemetic should be considered as effective initial therapy in clinical practice.
Summary 1: A systematic review revealed that dihydroergotamine (DHE) alone was less effective than subcutaneous sumatriptan in migraine pain reduction (OR=0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77) or headache resolution (OR=0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.42). No differences were seen between dihydroergotamine alone and chlorpromazine or lidocaine. Three studies revealed dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide was more effective than or equal to other agents for headache pain reduction at 2 hours: one vs ketorolac infectious mononucleosis (OR=7; 95% CI, 0.86-56.89), one vs meperidine (Demerol) plus hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax) infectious mononucleosis (OR=47.67; 95% CI, 4.32-526.17), and one vs valproate IV (OR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.19-2.33). Specifically, treatment with dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide was superior to ketorolac for pain reduction (P=.03), but patients did not differ in disability scores (P=.06). dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide achieved greater reductions in pain scale scores than meperidine plus hydroxyzine (P<.001). No significant difference in pain reduction was noted between dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide and valproate (P=.36).

Query 2: Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches?
Document 2: Migraine headache affects approximately 11 million adults in the United States. Spinal manipulation is a common alternative therapy for headaches, but its efficacy compared with standard medical therapies is unknown. To measure the relative efficacy of amitriptyline, spinal manipulation and the combination of both therapies for the prophylaxis of migraine headache. A prospective, randomized, parallel-group comparison. After a 4-wk baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to 8 wk of treatment, after which there was a 4-wk follow-up period. Chiropractic college outpatient clinic. A total of 218 patients with the diagnosis of migraine headache. An 8-wk course of therapy with spinal manipulation, amitriptyline or a combination of the two treatments. A headache index score derived from a daily headache pain diary during the last 4 wk of treatment and during the 4-wk follow-up period. Clinically important improvement was observed in both primary and secondary outcomes in all three study groups over time. The reduction in headache index scores during treatment compared with baseline was 49% for amitriptyline, 40% for spinal manipulation and 41% for the combined group; p = .66. During the posttreatment follow-up period the reduction from baseline was 24% for amitriptyline, 42% for spinal manipulation and 25% for the combined group; p = .05. There was no advantage to combining amitriptyline and spinal manipulation for the treatment of migraine headache. Spinal manipulation seemed to be as effective as a well-established and efficacious treatment (amitriptyline), and on the basis of a benign side effects profile, it should be considered a treatment option for patients with frequent migraine headaches.
Summary 2: In 1 trial of migraine prophylaxis, 218 patients were randomized to either 14 sessions of spinal manipulative therapy for 2 months or oral amitriptyline (titrated up weekly during the first month and continued at 100 mg daily over the second month). The headache index (a measure of daily pain intensity) was equivalent in both groups in the last 4 weeks of treatment (ES for spinal manipulative therapy vs amitriptyline= -0.1; 95% CI, -0.5 to 0.3). A month after both therapies were stopped, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower headache index in the group that had received spinal manipulative therapy than the group that had received amitriptyline (ES=0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8). Ten percent of the medication group withdrew from this study due to side effects; no side effects were reported from SMT.

Query: Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches?
Document: Non-invasive physical treatments are often used to treat common types of chronic/recurrent headache. To quantify and compare the magnitude of short- and long-term effects of non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. We searched the following databases from their inception to November 2002: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, CENTRAL, and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative Care and Supportive Care review group. Selected complementary medicine reference systems were searched as well. We also performed citation tracking and hand searching of potentially relevant journals. We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches to any type of control. Two independent reviewers abstracted trial information and scored trials for methodological quality. Outcomes data were standardized into percentage point and effect size scores wherever possible. The strength of the evidence of effectiveness was assessed using pre-specified rules. Twenty-two studies with a total of 2628 patients (age 12 to 78 years) met the inclusion criteria. Five types of headache were studied: migraine, tension-type, cervicogenic, a mix of migraine and tension-type, and post-traumatic headache. Ten studies had methodological quality scores of 50 or more (out of a possible 100 points), but many limitations were identified. We were unable to pool data because of study heterogeneity. For the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache, there is evidence that spinal manipulation may be an effective treatment option with a short-term effect similar to that of a commonly used, effective drug (amitriptyline). Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are pulsating electromagnetic fields and a combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] and electrical neurotransmitter modulation. For the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headache, amitriptyline is more effective than spinal manipulation during treatment. However, spinal manipulation is superior in the short term after cessation of both treatments. Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are therapeutic touch; cranial electrotherapy; a combination of TENS and electrical neurotransmitter modulation; and a regimen of auto-massage, TENS, and stretching. For episodic tension-type headache, there is evidence that adding spinal manipulation to massage is not effective. For the prophylactic treatment of cervicogenic headache, there is evidence that both neck exercise (low-intensity endurance training) and spinal manipulation are effective in the short and long term when compared to no treatment. There is also evidence that spinal manipulation is effective in the short term when compared to massage or placebo spinal manipulation, and weaker evidence when compared to spinal mobilization. There is weaker evidence that spinal mobilization is more effective in the short term than cold packs in the treatment of post-traumatic headache. A few non-invasive physical treatments may be effective as prophylactic treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. Based on trial results, these treatments appear to be associated with little risk of serious adverse effects. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods. The heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that the results of a few additional high-quality trials in the future could easily change the conclusions of our review.
Summary:","A trial randomized 30 patients to either SMT, mobilization (small oscillatory movements to a joint within its normal range), or wait-list placement. At the end of treatment, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater pain reduction in patients receiving SMT than either those receiving mobilization (ES=0.4; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.4) or those on the wait list (ES=0.6; 95% CI, -0.4 to 1.5)."

Query 1: Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches?
Document 1: To compare the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and pharmaceutical treatment (amitriptyline) for chronic tension-type headache. Randomized controlled trial using two parallel groups. The study consisted of a 2-wk baseline period, a 6-wk treatment period and a 4-wk posttreatment, follow-up period. Chiropractic college outpatient clinic. One hundred and fifty patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with a diagnosis of tension-type headaches of at least 3 months' duration at a frequency of at least once per wk. 6 wk of spinal manipulative therapy provided by chiropractors or 6 wk of amitriptyline treatment managed by a medical physician. Change in patient-reported daily headache intensity, weekly headache frequency, over-the-counter medication usage and functional health status (SF-36). A total of 448 people responded to the recruitment advertisements; 298 were excluded during the screening process. Of the 150 patients who were enrolled in the study, 24 (16%) dropped out: 5 (6.6%) from the spinal manipulative therapy and 19 (27.1%) from the amitriptyline therapy group. During the treatment period, both groups improved at very similar rates in all primary outcomes. In relation to baseline values at 4 wk after cessation of treatment, the spinal manipulation group showed a reduction of 32% in headache intensity, 42% in headache frequency, 30% in over-the-counter medication usage and an improvement of 16% in functional health status. By comparison, the amitriptyline therapy group showed no improvement or a slight worsening from baseline values in the same four major outcome measures. Controlling for baseline differences, all group differences at 4 wk after cessation of therapy were considered to be clinically important and were statistically significant. Of the patients who finished the study, 46 (82.1%) in the amitriptyline therapy group reported side effects that included drowsiness, dry mouth and weight gain. Three patients (4.3%) in the spinal manipulation group reported neck soreness and stiffness. The results of this study show that spinal manipulative therapy is an effective treatment for tension headaches. Amitriptyline therapy was slightly more effective in reducing pain at the end of the treatment period but was associated with more side effects. Four weeks after the cessation of treatment, however, the patients who received spinal manipulative therapy experienced a sustained therapeutic benefit in all major outcomes in contrast to the patients that received amitriptyline therapy, who reverted to baseline values. The sustained therapeutic benefit associated with spinal manipulation seemed to result in a decreased need for over-the-counter medication. There is a need to assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy beyond four weeks and to compare spinal manipulative therapy to an appropriate placebo such as sham manipulation in future clinical trials.
Summary 1: Two trials investigated the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy on tension-type headaches. The first, an randomized controlled trials with 150 patients with recurrent headaches, compared spinal manipulative therapy (2 sessions per week) with amitriptyline (10 mg daily week 1, 20 mg daily week 2, then 30 mg daily) for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, the spinal manipulative therapy group reported a nonsignificant trend toward more headache pain (ES for spinal manipulative therapy vs amitriptyline= -0.4; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.0), but fewer side effects. They had similar headache frequency and medication use.

Query: Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches?
Document: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial with unblinded treatment and blinded outcome assessment was conducted. The treatment period was 6 weeks with follow-up assessment after treatment, then at 3, 6, and 12 months. To determine the effectiveness of manipulative therapy and a low-load exercise program for cervicogenic headache when used alone and in combination, as compared with a control group. Headaches arising from cervical musculoskeletal disorders are common. Conservative therapies are recommended as the first treatment of choice. Evidence for the effectiveness of manipulative therapy is inconclusive and available only for the short term. There is no evidence for exercise, and no study has investigated the effect of combined therapies for cervicogenic headache. In this study, 200 participants who met the diagnostic criteria for cervicogenic headache were randomized into four groups: manipulative therapy group, exercise therapy group, combined therapy group, and a control group. The primary outcome was a change in headache frequency. Other outcomes included changes in headache intensity and duration, the Northwick Park Neck Pain Index, medication intake, and patient satisfaction. Physical outcomes included pain on neck movement, upper cervical joint tenderness, a craniocervical flexion muscle test, and a photographic measure of posture. There were no differences in headache-related and demographic characteristics between the groups at baseline. The loss to follow-up evaluation was 3.5%. At the 12-month follow-up assessment, both manipulative therapy and specific exercise had significantly reduced headache frequency and intensity, and the neck pain and effects were maintained (P < 0.05 for all). The combined therapies was not significantly superior to either therapy alone, but 10% more patients gained relief with the combination. Effect sizes were at least moderate and clinically relevant. Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce the symptoms of cervicogenic headache, and the effects are maintained.
Summary:","A multicenter trial randomized 200 patients with cervicogenic headaches to either SMT (8-12 sessions over 6 weeks) or placebo. The SMT group had significantly reduced pain (at 1 week, effect size [ES]=0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-1.2; and at 12 months, ES=0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8) and fewer headaches (ES=0.7; 95% CI, 0.3-1.1 at both time points) than placebo."

Query 1: What are the causes of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in a newborn?
Document 1: The Dutch T(4)-TSH-TBG-based neonatal screening program detects patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) of thyroidal (CH-T) as well as central (CH-C) origin. The numbers and characteristics of true-positive and false-positive referrals will differ from other, predominantly TSH-based, screening methods. The present study describes the characteristics of the referred neonates, both CH patients and false positives, and of the reported CH patients with a false-negative screening result born in the study period. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For each referred child born between April 1, 2002, and May 31, 2004, screening results and first venous sample results were recorded and classified as transient or permanent CH-T or CH-C or as no CH. In the study period, 430,764 children were screened. Of the 772 children with abnormal screening results, 224 (29%) had CH; another 13 CH patients did not have abnormal screening results, giving an overall CH incidence of 1:1800. Incidences of permanent CH, permanent CH-T, permanent CH-C, and transient CH were 1:2200, 1:2500, 1:21,000, and 1:12,000, respectively. The most frequent explanations for the 548 false-positive referrals (71% of the referred cohort) were severe illness and TBG deficiency (occurring in 198 and 200 children, respectively). The Dutch incidence figures for CH belong to the highest worldwide, suggesting that the T(4)-TSH-TBG screening program is an efficient method to detect CH of variable etiology and severity. Still, a small percentage of children with CH escaped detection via this screening approach. Severe illness and TBG deficiency appear to be responsible for the majority of false-positive referrals.
Summary 1: A study from the Netherlands examined diagnoses of infants with an increased thyroid-stimulating hormone on newborn screening heelstick. Of 112 newborns with a thyroid-stimulating hormone >50 mU/L, 110 (98%) had congenital hypothyroidism on further examination. However, only 34 of 594 (5.7%) newborns with a thyroid-stimulating hormone between 9 and 20 mU/L were diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism. Nineteen of 46 newborns (41%) with levels between 20 and 50 mU/L had congenital hypothyroidism.

Query 2: What are the causes of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in a newborn?
Document 2: Many developed countries are reexperiencing iodine deficiency. One World Health Organization index of iodine deficiency in populations is the percentage of neonates with TSH levels greater than 5 mIU/liter 72 h after delivery. Measured TSH levels vary with methodology and are influenced by external factors including iodine exposure at time of delivery. We wished to determine whether babies delivered by cesarean section have higher levels of TSH than babies delivered vaginally because this factor could influence determination of iodine deficiency. This was a cohort study of mothers delivering at a teaching hospital in 2002-2003 and their babies. Women delivering a live infant were eligible for the study. Demographic data, mode of delivery, and subsequent routine newborn screening TSH levels were recorded. Of 2031 infants, 31.2% were delivered by cesarean section; 1864 babies were born after 37 wk, with blood samples collected by d 5 (>91% on d 3). Significant predictors of TSH concentration were the day TSH was measured and type of delivery. The distribution curve of TSH values was right shifted in infants born by cesarean section. The percentage of neonates born by cesarean with at TSH value greater than 5 was 7.1%. The figure for those born vaginally was 4.3%. Babies delivered by cesarean section are significantly more likely to have TSH levels greater than 5 mIU/liter on d 3 than those delivered vaginally. With the rise in the rate of births by cesarean, this could be an important factor in assessing population iodine deficiency using neonatal TSH levels.
Summary 2: In term, healthy newborns, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels normally increase to levels of 60 mU/L within 30 minutes of delivery. This is followed by a rapid decline in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels over the first 5 days of life to <10 mU/L. An Australian study found more elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels for samples drawn on day 2 of life compared with day 3 of life, likely reflecting normal postnatal physiology. Age-specific reference ranges are necessary for interpretation of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels during the first 5 days of life. The second or third day of life remains the optimal time for screening when appropriate reference ranges are used.

Query: What are the causes of elevated TSH in a newborn?
Document: The Dutch T(4)-TSH-TBG-based neonatal screening program detects patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) of thyroidal (CH-T) as well as central (CH-C) origin. The numbers and characteristics of true-positive and false-positive referrals will differ from other, predominantly TSH-based, screening methods. The present study describes the characteristics of the referred neonates, both CH patients and false positives, and of the reported CH patients with a false-negative screening result born in the study period. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For each referred child born between April 1, 2002, and May 31, 2004, screening results and first venous sample results were recorded and classified as transient or permanent CH-T or CH-C or as no CH. In the study period, 430,764 children were screened. Of the 772 children with abnormal screening results, 224 (29%) had CH; another 13 CH patients did not have abnormal screening results, giving an overall CH incidence of 1:1800. Incidences of permanent CH, permanent CH-T, permanent CH-C, and transient CH were 1:2200, 1:2500, 1:21,000, and 1:12,000, respectively. The most frequent explanations for the 548 false-positive referrals (71% of the referred cohort) were severe illness and TBG deficiency (occurring in 198 and 200 children, respectively). The Dutch incidence figures for CH belong to the highest worldwide, suggesting that the T(4)-TSH-TBG screening program is an efficient method to detect CH of variable etiology and severity. Still, a small percentage of children with CH escaped detection via this screening approach. Severe illness and TBG deficiency appear to be responsible for the majority of false-positive referrals.
Summary:","A study explored the presumed causes of elevated TSH among children who were diagnosed with transient hypothyroidism (initially elevated TSH level found to be normal on follow-up testing). The most common causes were thyroid-binding globulin deficiency (200/548 or 36% of newborns with transient hypothyroidism), severe illness (36%), prematurity (8%), and errors in screening procedures (4%). The study found that of 34 children with transient hypothyroidism, 10 had mothers with undertreated or unrecognized Graves disease."

Query 1: How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer?
Document 1: To assess the effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening tests for adults at average risk. Recent systematic reviews; Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2nd edition; and focused searches of MEDLINE from 1966 through September 2001. The authors also conducted hand searches, reviewed bibliographies, and consulted context experts to ensure completeness. When available, the most recent high-quality systematic review was used to identify relevant articles. This review was then supplemented with a MEDLINE search for more recent articles. One reviewer abstracted information from the final set of studies into evidence tables, and a second reviewer checked the tables for accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. For average-risk adults older than 50 years of age, evidence from multiple well-conducted randomized trials supported the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates compared with no screening. Data from well-conducted case-control studies supported the effectiveness of sigmoidoscopy and possibly colonoscopy in reducing colon cancer incidence and mortality rates. A nonrandomized, controlled trial examining colorectal cancer mortality rates and randomized trials examining diagnostic yield supported the use of fecal occult blood testing plus sigmoidoscopy. The effectiveness of barium enema is unclear. Data are insufficient to support a definitive determination of the most effective screening strategy. Colorectal cancer screening reduces death from colorectal cancer and can decrease the incidence of disease through removal of adenomatous polyps. Several available screening options seem to be effective, but the single best screening approach cannot be determined because data are insufficient.
Summary 1: The us preventive services task force review did not find any screening trials of colonoscopy but analyzed data from the National Polyp Study and a case-control study to draw its conclusions. The review reported an odds ratio for colorectal cancer mortality for patients who had colonoscopy to be 0.43 (95% CI, 0.30-63).

Summary 2: A systematic review performed for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) incorporated more recent data on colorectal cancer screening including colonoscopy. This review reached similar conclusions as above. This review also looked at office fecal occult blood test performed after digital rectal exam. It is important to note that a single office fecal occult blood test has a lower sensitivity than 3-card home fecal occult blood test and its effectiveness for reducing colorectal cancer mortality was unknown at the time of the systematic review. The us preventive services task force review also looked at the sensitivity and adverse effects of fecal occult blood test compared to colonoscopy. One-time 3-card home fecal occult blood test had a sensitivity of 30% to 40% for detecting cancer. The sensitivity of one-time colonoscopy was difficult to determine since it was the criterion standard examination, but it was estimated to be greater than 90%, with a risk of perforation of 1/2000.

Query: How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer?
Document: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of illness and death in the Western world. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, it is the second commonest cancer for women after breast cancer (age-standardised incidence 22-33 per 100,000), and men after prostate or lung cancer (age-standardised incidence 31-47 per 100,000) (Jeffs et al, 1996; Parkin et al, 1992). Just under half of all persons affected will die from their disease (Jeffs et al, 1996; Parkin et al, 1992) The human and financial costs of this disease have prompted considerable research efforts to evaluate the ability of screening tests to detect the cancer at an early curable stage. Tests which have been considered for screening include faecal occult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. To determine whether screening for colorectal cancer using the faecal occult blood test, Hemoccult reduces colorectal cancer mortality and to consider the benefits and harms of screening. Published and unpublished data for this review were identified by: * retrieving studies included in a systematic review conducted by some of the authors in 1995, * searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, * writing to trial lists. All controlled trials of screening for colorectal cancer using Hemoccult were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors. Data analysis was performed using the group subjects were randomised to ('intention to screen'), whether or not they were ever screened. To estimate the effect of Hemoccult screening on colorectal cancer mortality, we calculated relative risks and risk differences for each trial, and then overall, using fixed and random effects models and tested for heterogeneity of effects. We calculated summary measures of effect including all trials and also for just the randomised controlled trials. We also calculated a summary measure of effect, adjusted for attendance at screening in each trial (not shown in Meta-view). Meta-analysis of mortality results from the randomised controlled trials shows that those allocated to screening had a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 16% (RR 0.84, CI: 0.77-0.93). When adjusted for screening attendance in the individual studies, the mortality reduction is 23% (RR 0.77, CI: 0.57-0.89). Overall, if 10 000 people were offered a biennial Hemoccult screening program and two-thirds attended for at least one Hemoccult test, there would be 8.5 deaths (CI: 3.6-13.5) from colorectal cancer prevented over 10 years. However, the screening program would also result in 2 800 participants having at least one colonoscopy, if screening harms from the Minnesota trial are considered, and there would be 3.4 colonoscopy complications (perforation or haemorrhage). If screening harms from the Gothenburg trial are considered, approximately 600 participants would need at least one sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema, resulting in 1.8 perforations or haemorrhages. Screening benefits include reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, possible reduction in cancer incidence through detection and removal of colorectal adenomas and potentially, treatment of early colorectal cancers may involve less invasive surgery. Harmful effects of screening include the physical complications of colonoscopy, disruption to lifestyle, stress and discomfort of testing and investigations, and the anxiety caused by falsely positive screening tests. Although screening benefits are likely to outweigh harms for populations at increased risk of colorectal cancer, we need more information about the harmful effects of screening, the community's responses to screening and screening costs for different health care systems before widespread screening can be recommended.
Summary:","A Cochrane review conducted a meta-analysis looking only at FOBT for colorectal cancer screening. This review, based on published and unpublished data from 5 controlled trials, demonstrated that 3-card home FOBT conferred a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 16% (relative risk [RR]=0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.92) and a number needed to screen of 1173 (95% CI, 741-2807) to prevent 1 death from colon cancer over a 10-year period. If adjusted for adherence to screening, the reduction in mortality increased to 23% (RR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89)."

Query 1: How can we best treat and monitor venous thromboembolism during pregnancy?
Document 1: Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have been shown to be at least as effective as unfractionated (UF) heparin in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in nonpregnant subjects. LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required.
Summary 1: For the initial week of treatment, the unfractionated heparin group received an IV bolus followed by infusion titrated to aPTT levels (goal 70-100s), while lowmolecular-weight heparin group received subcutaneous dalteparin 115 IU/kg twice daily adjusted to target antifactor Xa levels of 1 to 1.5 IU/mL 3 hours after injection. After 7 days, both groups received prophylactic doses of dalteparin throughout the remainder of pregnancy. There were no significant differences in outcome including bleeding or fetal effects. No cases of thrombocytopenia or pulmonary embolus were seen. There was 1 case of progressive thrombosis for a patient on low-molecular-weight heparin.

Query: How can we best treat and monitor VTE during pregnancy?
Document: Venous thromboembolism remains an important cause of maternal mortality. For women at risk during pregnancy, the recommended venous thromboembolismprophylaxis is unfractionated heparin. Low molecular weight heparins, such as dalteparin, also may be suitable, but randomised trials have not been performed. Pregnant women (105) with confirmed previous or current thromboembolism were randomised to receive either unfractionated heparin twice daily (mean 20569 IU/day) or dalteparin once daily (mean 4631 IU anti-factor Xa units/day) subcutaneously for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum period. Recurrence of venous thromboembolism and safety of treatments were assessed. Dalteparin administered once daily was safe and effective in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum.
Summary:","One randomized controlled trial compared unfractionated with low-molecular-weight heparin for VTE prophylaxis among 107 high-risk pregnant patients. The unfractionated heparin group received 7500 IU subcutaneously twice daily adjusted to aPTT levels, while the dalteparin group received weight-adjusted doses to target antifactor Xa levels >0.2 IU/mL at 3 hours. No thromboembolic complications occurred in either group (95% confidence interval, 0 to 2 in both groups). Minor bleeding complications were significantly more common with unfractionated heparin than with low-molecular-weight heparin. Two bleeds requiring transfusion and 2 lumbosacral compression fractures were also observed in the unfractionated heparin group, compared with none in the dalteparin group (difference not statistically significant)."

Query 1: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document 1: Clinical criteria to select patients with headache in whom structural diagnostic studies (computed tomography) have a high yield disclosing intracranial pathologic findings, independent of abnormal findings on neurologic examination, have not been defined. To determine which clinical characteristics predict the presence of intracranial pathologic findings, independently of neurologic examination, in patients with headache. Case-control, consecutive sample. Major metropolitan trauma center emergency department. Hospital records of 139 hospitalized and 329 randomly selected patients from 1720 nonhospitalized adult patients, consecutively evaluated for headache in the emergency department, were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the headache, results of neurologic and physical examinations, and diagnostic radiologic and laboratory results were correlated with final diagnosis and outcome at 6 months after emergency department visit. Nonparametric statistical analysis. Intracranial pathologic findings were found in 18 (3.8%) of 468 patients. Acute onset and occipitonuchal location of headache, presence of associated symptoms, and patient age of 55 years or older were significantly associated with the finding of intracranial pathology, independently of the findings from neurologic examination. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination alone, whether focal or nonfocal, had a highly significant association and a positive predictive value for intracranial pathology of 39%. Abnormal results from neurologic examination are the best clinical parameters to predict structural intracranial pathology; however, in patients 55 years or older with headache of acute onset located in the occipitonuchal region that has associated symptoms, computed tomographic scan of the head is justified as part of their clinical evaluation independently of the findings of the neurologic examination.
Summary 1: A case-control study reviewed hospital records of 468 patients evaluated in the emergency department for nontraumatic headache. Neuroimaging (CT scan or cerebral angiogram) was performed for 160 of these patients. Final diagnosis and outcome was obtained at 6 months. The symptoms and their ability to predict intracranial pathology are as follows: abnormal neurologic examination (sensitivity=39%; LR+=19.5), location of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=4.87), age of patient (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), multiple associated symptoms (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), mode of onset of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=2.23), and presence of associated symptoms (sensitivity=89%; LR+=1.41). Again, abnormal neurologic examination was the most significant indicator for imaging. This study did not define associated symptoms nor did it specify what determined which patients were imaged.

Query 2: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document 2: From a consecutive series of 3,847 headache patients, 1,331 patients who made first visits for new headache to 120 primary care physicians were studied for usual care over a 14-month period. Either tension or vascular headache was the initial diagnosis in 23.8 percent and 12.8 percent of patients, respectively. Nearly one half (47.8 percent) were classified as having headaches other than tension or vascular. A total of 15.3 percent of headaches were undiagnosed or were regarded as a mixture of traditional diagnostic designations. At first visit, most patients (76.6 percent) were managed without diagnostic tests. Drugs were prescribed for 73.6 percent, and advice was given for 58.6 percent. Only 2.0 percent of patients had computerized tomographic scanning ordered at first visit, although at least 46 percent met National Institutes of Health criteria, a finding with potential economic consequences of at least $2 billion. These findings suggest the need for reevaluation of diagnostic categories for headache, reevaluation of strategies for headache management, and further investigations of headache in primary care patients.
Summary 2: Information concerning the workup of headache in the ambulatory setting is limited. In actual practice, only about 3% of patients who present with a new headache in the office setting have neuroimaging ordered.

Query: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document: Our aims were to investigate the frequency of intracranial lesions detected by cranial computed tomography (CT-scan) amongst adult patients who had clinical warning criteria (CWC) for secondary neurological headaches and to determine the importance of CWC in predicting a possible lesion on CT-scan. Seventy consecutive patients with headache exhibiting CWC were included in this prospective study. The CWC included: (i) increase in the intensity and frequency of headache; (ii) abrupt onset of headache; (iii) persistence of headache despite analgesics; (iv) alteration of the characteristics of headache; and (v) presence of focal neurological symptoms or findings. The mean age of the patients was 46.5 years; the female-to-male ratio was 1.5. Of the patients, 35.7% had a neurological cause identified by CT-scan, and 64.3% had normal CT-scan. In the patients without lesion, of headaches, 64.4% were primary, and 35.6% were from undefined headache group. Although, of the above criteria, only the 5th was different markedly in the patients with lesion than the patients without lesion, in evaluation by CT-scan the secondary neurological headaches in adults, all CWC should look for absolutely in their history and physical examination.
Summary:","A validating cohort study looked at 5 clinical warning criteria for patients seen in an emergency department for headache; 70 adults with acute headache as the chief complaint were included. Allpatients received computed tomography (CT) scanning as part of their evaluation. Abrupt onset and focal neurologic findings most strongly predicted intracranial lesions. Overall, 36% of the patients (25/70) had significant pathology."

Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the headache, results of neurologic and physical examinations, and diagnostic radiologic and laboratory results were correlated with final diagnosis and outcome at 6 months after emergency department visit. Nonparametric statistical analysis. Intracranial pathologic findings were found in 18 (3.8%) of 468 patients. Acute onset and occipitonuchal location of headache, presence of associated symptoms, and patient age of 55 years or older were significantly associated with the finding of intracranial pathology, independently of the findings from neurologic examination. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination alone, whether focal or nonfocal, had a highly significant association and a positive predictive value for intracranial pathology of 39%. Abnormal results from neurologic examination are the best clinical parameters to predict structural intracranial pathology; however, in patients 55 years or older with headache of acute onset located in the occipitonuchal region that has associated symptoms, computed tomographic scan of the head is justified as part of their clinical evaluation independently of the findings of the neurologic examination.
Summary 1: A case-control study reviewed hospital records of 468 patients evaluated in the emergency department for nontraumatic headache. Neuroimaging (CT scan or cerebral angiogram) was performed for 160 of these patients. Final diagnosis and outcome was obtained at 6 months. The symptoms and their ability to predict intracranial pathology are as follows: abnormal neurologic examination (sensitivity=39%; LR+=19.5), location of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=4.87), age of patient (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), multiple associated symptoms (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), mode of onset of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=2.23), and presence of associated symptoms (sensitivity=89%; LR+=1.41). Again, abnormal neurologic examination was the most significant indicator for imaging. This study did not define associated symptoms nor did it specify what determined which patients were imaged.

Query 2: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document 2: From a consecutive series of 3,847 headache patients, 1,331 patients who made first visits for new headache to 120 primary care physicians were studied for usual care over a 14-month period. Either tension or vascular headache was the initial diagnosis in 23.8 percent and 12.8 percent of patients, respectively. Nearly one half (47.8 percent) were classified as having headaches other than tension or vascular. A total of 15.3 percent of headaches were undiagnosed or were regarded as a mixture of traditional diagnostic designations. At first visit, most patients (76.6 percent) were managed without diagnostic tests. Drugs were prescribed for 73.6 percent, and advice was given for 58.6 percent. Only 2.0 percent of patients had computerized tomographic scanning ordered at first visit, although at least 46 percent met National Institutes of Health criteria, a finding with potential economic consequences of at least $2 billion. These findings suggest the need for reevaluation of diagnostic categories for headache, reevaluation of strategies for headache management, and further investigations of headache in primary care patients.
Summary 2: Information concerning the workup of headache in the ambulatory setting is limited. In actual practice, only about 3% of patients who present with a new headache in the office setting have neuroimaging ordered.

Query: When is neuroimaging warranted for headache?
Document: Clinicians in the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) order computed tomography (CT) scans for approximately 3% of patients with headache. This study was undertaken to provide information about the reasons for ordering CT scans and the results obtained. Weekly return cards were used to collect data on every patient for whom a CT scan was ordered to investigate a headache during a 19-month period. Copies of CT reports were reviewed, and a chart audit was performed to collect further clinical information whenever an intracranial tumor, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or subdural hematoma (SDH) was reported. Clinicians in 58 practices ordered 349 CT scans. Only 52 patients (15%) had abnormalities noted on neurological examination. Most CT scans were ordered because the clinician believed that a tumor (49%) or an SAH (9%) might be present. Fifty-nine (17%) were ordered because of patient expectation or medicolegal concerns. Of the 293 reports reviewed, 14 indicated that a tumor, an SAH, or an SDH was present. Two of the 14 (14%) were false positives. Forty-four (15%) of the reports noted incidental findings of questionable significance. Because there are no clear guidelines for the use of CT for the investigation of headache, physicians must exercise good clinical judgment in their attempts to identify treatable disease in a cost-effective manner. ASPN clinicians made selective use of CT scans based on a combination of factors that included physician and patient concerns. CT was an imperfect tool in this setting. Most of the positive results represented false positives or incidental findings that could have led to adverse effects and additional costs.
Summary:","When neuroimaging is performed, about 4% of CT scans find a significant and treatable lesion (in one sample of 293 CT scans, there were 12 true-positive scans and 2 false-positive scans)."

Query 1: What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy?
Document 1: We prospectively compared pregnancy outcome after exposure to sumatriptan with that of disease-matched controls and nonteratogen controls. There were no differences in the rates of live births, spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, or major birth defects among the three groups. This first prospective report suggests that the use of sumatriptan during organogenesis is not associated with an apparent increased risk of major birth defects.
Summary 1: One prospective controlled cohort study showed an increase in miscarriage rates that did not reach statistical significance.

Query 2: What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy?
Document 2: Concerns about the effects of maternal medications on the growing baby limit the use of medication treatment for benign conditions, such as recurring headaches, during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacological therapies hold particular promise for pregnant women due to the limited medication options. No controlled studies, however, have reported on the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments for pregnant women. The first study evaluated the effectiveness of a combined nonpharmacological treatment (CT) consisting of relaxation, skin-warming biofeedback, and physical therapy for pregnant women with chronic headaches. In a second study, the CT protocol was compared with an attention control (AC) that received headache education and skin-cooling biofeedback. The first study resulted in significant symptom improvement in 79% of subjects, with an overall 72.9% reduction in headaches. In the second study, both groups improved with treatment; however the CT group was more likely to experience significant headache relief (72.7%) than the AC group (28.6%, chi 2(1) = 4.97, p < .03). Significant improvement was maintained at a 6-month follow-up for over 50% of patients. It is concluded that the combined nonpharmacological treatment was more effective than an attention control in reducing headaches during pregnancy. This treatment was effective regardless of predisposing variables.
Summary 2: Two studies were published together evaluating thermal biofeedback, relaxation training, and physical therapy exercises. The first, a cohort study, showed decrease in symptoms for 15 of 19 women. The second, a small randomized controlled trial, compared 11 women using the combination treatment with 14 control women who received attention from the therapist but no other intervention. More than 72% of the treatment arm improved, compared with nearly 29% of the attention control group. Interpretation of these studies is limited by small sample size and testing in settings with specialized resources that are not found in every community.

Query: What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy?
Document: To review the literature for treatment of migraine headaches with sumatriptan during pregnancy. Studies and reports were located in International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2003) and MEDLINE (1966-week 3 September 2003). Research has been performed to evaluate the risk of teratogenesis after sumatriptan exposure in pregnant patients. Data have been collected in areas including placental transmission of sumatriptan, prospective pregnancy registries, open-labeled and controlled prospective studies, and a retrospective prescription-linked study. As of August 6, 2004, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted with exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy. Teratogenesis occurs in approximately 150 000 births per year which represents an incidence of 3-5%. Available literature to date indicates that exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has no additional risk of birth defects compared with the incidence in the general population.
Summary:",Six studies have evaluated sumatriptan use in pregnancy. All were designed to evaluate teratogenicity and harm. None evaluated treatment efficacy in pregnancy.

Query 1: What could be behind your elderly patient's subjective memory complaints?
Document 1: To study whether subjective memory deterioration is associated with future dementia in older people. A population-based prospective cohort study begun in 1994 with biennial follow-up interviews. Community-based members of Group Health Cooperative, a large health maintenance organization in the Seattle area. A sample of 1,883 subjects, dementia free, aged 65 and older, who scored 91 or higher on the 100-point Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI) at study entry. Subjective memory was assessed by asking whether memory had changed on 5-point Likert scales (e.g., 1=definitely improved, 3=no change, 5=definitely deteriorated) with regard to five items: remembering names, faces, friends, and appointments and judging the time. The items were summed for a possible total score ranging from 5 to 25. Subjective memory deterioration was defined as present if the total score was 20 or above. Cognitive performance was measured using the CASI. Incident dementia cases were identified using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Of 1,883 subjects, 126 developed dementia during 5 years of follow-up. Subjective memory deterioration was associated with cognitive decline and incident dementia. Age modified the association between subjective memory deterioration and future dementia. For persons reporting subjective memory deterioration at the ages of 70, 75, and 80, the hazard ratios of developing dementia were 6.0 (95% confidence interval (CI)=2.1-18), 3.2 (95% CI=1.6-6.2) and 1.6 (95% CI=0.86-3.1), respectively. Subjective memory deterioration was found to precede the development of dementia in older people with normal cognitive screening results. These findings suggest that a high level of subjective memory deterioration in persons with normal objective cognitive function may identify a subset of individuals at greater risk for developing dementia.
Summary 1: A study of 1883 patients with normal baseline short-cognitive test results found that those with subjective memory complaints had a higher incidence of dementia. At 5-year follow-up, 15% of patients with baseline subjective memory complaints had developed dementia compared to only 6% of those without such complaints (odds ratio=2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-4.98).

Query 2: What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures?
Document 2: Delirium and pain are common following hip fracture. Untreated pain has been shown to increase the risk of delirium in older adults undergoing elective surgery. This study was performed to examine the relationship among pain, analgesics, and other factors on delirium in hip fracture patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study at four New York hospitals that enrolled 541 patients with hip fracture and without delirium. Delirium was identified prospectively by patient interview supplemented by medical record review. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Eighty-seven of 541 patients (16%) became delirious. Among all subjects, risk factors for delirium were cognitive impairment (relative risk, or RR, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, or CI, 1.8-7.2), abnormal blood pressure (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.7), and heart failure (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.3). Patients who received less than 10 mg of parenteral morphine sulfate equivalents per day were more likely to develop delirium than patients who received more analgesia (RR 5.4, 95% CI 2.4-12.3). Patients who received meperidine were at increased risk of developing delirium as compared with patients who received other opioid analgesics (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5). In cognitively intact patients, severe pain significantly increased the risk of delirium (RR 9.0, 95% CI 1.8-45.2). Using admission data, clinicians can identify patients at high risk for delirium following hip fracture. Avoiding opioids or using very low doses of opioids increased the risk of delirium. Cognitively intact patients with undertreated pain were nine times more likely to develop delirium than patients whose pain was adequately treated. Undertreated pain and inadequate analgesia appear to be risk factors for delirium in frail older adults.
Summary 2: In a cohort study, those patients whose pain was inadequately controlled also had an increased risk for delirium (RR=9.0; 95% CI, 1.8-45.2). Meperidine use increased the risk for delirium compared with other opioid analgesics (RR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5).

Query: Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care?
Document: The goal of the present study was to assess the validity of the Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines for dementia patients, as well as identify predictors that could more accurately identify prognosis in dementia patients referred to hospice. A retrospective chart review was conducted, including initial assessment and longitudinal follow-up of patients until the time of death. In addition, a second validation cohort was also followed. Participants consisted of 245 patients admitted to a large community-based hospice with a diagnosis of dementia, including a validation sample of 80 patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival and a Cox regression analysis (p > 0. 05) revealed no significant relationship between the Medicare guidelines or any component of the guidelines and survival at six months for the initial and validation samples. Significant multivariate predictors of shorter survival in both the initial and validation sample include greater age (p = 0. 02) and anorexia (p < 0. 001), as well as a combination of anorexia and greater functional impairment (p = 0.005). Overall, the results indicated that the Medicare guidelines were not valid predictors of survival in hospice patients with dementia and should be altered to include empirically valid predictors. Advanced age, as well as impaired nutritional and functional status, was associated with shortened survival in these patients. The predictor variables identified are an initial step toward providing improved prognoses for advanced dementia patients, their families, and practitioners. Broader issues in improving access to hospice care for dementia patients are discussed.

Query 1: How do we decide when a patient with nonmalignant disease is eligible for hospice care?
Document 1: Many proponents of hospice care believe that this service is underutilized. To determine physicians' perceptions of hospice utilization and of their own hospice referral pattern; their perceived and actual knowledge of appropriate hospice referral diagnoses; and perceived barriers to hospice referral. Surveys for anonymous response were distributed to 125 physicians in 2 internal medicine departments of a large not-for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO). Of these 125 physicians, 89% responded, including 91 staff physicians and 20 residents. Of the 111 physician-respondents, 78% reported their belief that hospice care was underutilized; 84% were unable to identify appropriate hospice diagnoses; and 12% were aware of the ""National Hospice Organization Medical Guidelines for Determining Prognosis in Selected Non-Cancer Diseases."" Difficulty of predicting death to within 6 months was cited by 37% as the foremost barrier to hospice referral. In addition, 28% expressed concern that patients or families would interpret hospice referral as a cost saving measure; 11% of respondents had been accused of using hospice referral for this purpose. Our study-the first major survey of physician attitudes and practices regarding hospice utilization in an HMO setting-showed that barriers to hospice referral are similar to those in non-HMO settings; physicians have difficulty predicting life expectancy and lack knowledge of patient eligibility guidelines. Physician concern that patients or their family members would construe hospice referral as a cost-saving technique may be a barrier particularly troublesome in an HMO setting.
Summary 1: Brickner et al's survey demonstrated that physicians find accurate prognostication difficult. Furthermore, many of the common noncancer diseases have erratic and unpredictable courses, making prognosis even harder.

Query 2: Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment?
Document 2: To evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-motor program in patients with early Alzheimer disease (AD) who are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI). Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (12), mild AD (48), and moderate AD (24) (Global Deterioration Scale stages 3, 4, and 5) were randomized to receive psychosocial support plus cognitive-motor intervention (experimental group) or psychosocial support alone (control group). Cognitive-motor intervention (CMI) consisted of a 1-year structured program of 103 sessions of cognitive exercises, plus social and psychomotor activities. The primary efficacy measure was the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Secondary efficacy measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Evaluations were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months by blinded evaluators. Patients in the CMI group maintained cognitive status at month 6, whereas patients in the control group had significantly declined at that time. Cognitive response was higher in the patients with fewer years of formal education. In addition, more patients in the experimental group maintained or improved their affective status at month 12 (experimental group, 75%; control group, 47%; p = 0.017). A long-term CMI in ChEI-treated early Alzheimer disease patients produced additional mood and cognitive benefits.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials of galantamine showed initial cognitive improvement in mild cognitive impairment patients.

Query: Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care?
Document: Because survival time varies greatly in dementia, it is difficult for dementia patients to meet a key criterion for the Medicare Hospice Benefit, a six-month survival time. In a previous study, the authors examined guidelines for admitting dementia patients to hospice; the National Hospice Organization (NHO) guidelines were found to work well in identifying appropriate candidates for hospice among dementia patients. This was especially true for those patients whose deficits had progressed in an ordinal fashion consistent with Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) and who had reached stage 7C. The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of the NHO guidelines in identifying dementia patients who are appropriate for hospice; the limitations of these guidelines regarding non-ordinal patients; and the importance of the actual care plans used--as opposed to our previous study, which only examined initial treatment plans. Forty-five dementia patients enrolled in Hospice of the Great Lakes in Illinois were studied longitudinally over two years; this included a follow-up period of at least six months for all patients. Measures included: survival time; FAST; a medical complications checklist, which consisted of common complications of end-stage dementia; and co-morbid medical conditions and aggressive care, which consisted of feeding tubes, antibiotics, and Foley catheters used during the course of the study. Patients who had reached Stage 7C at intake had a mean survival time of 4.1 months; and the majority (71 percent) died within six months. Non-ordinal patients lived significantly longer at a mean of 10.9 months (p < .01), and and the minority (30 percent) died within six months. Foley catheters decreased survival time; and the use of antibiotics did not make a difference. This study echoed our previous findings regarding the usefulness of NHO guidelines in identifying dementia patients with a survival time of six months or less, specifically those at stage 7C or greater. The findings also suggest that the nature of the palliative care plan influences survival time.
Summary:","Use of antibiotics did not make a statistically significant difference in survival, and use of Foley catheters was associated with shorter survival times (3.6 months vs 9 months; P<.03.)."

Query 1: What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy?
Document 1: A randomised crossover trial was performed in 55 pregnant women who complained of heartburn to see whether alkali or acid treatment alleviated it. Each woman was given a week's treatment with an acid mixture, an alkali mixture, and a placebo in randomised order. Both acid and alkali mixtures were better than placebo, but there was no significant difference between the acid and alkali treatments. Together with the inconsistent reports of some patients, these findings suggest that both acid reflux and bile regurgitation may cause heartburn in pregnant women and that other factors may also play a part. Because the cause of heartburn may be difficult to determine, treatment should be empirical. If the patient does not respond to seven days' acid treatment an alkali mixture should be prescribed; there is a 98% chance that one of these treatments will relieve symptoms.
Summary 1: Atlay and colleagues found that sodium bicarbonate significantly reduced reflux symptoms compared with placebo (P=.021; NNT=6.0).

Query 2: What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy?
Document 2: Our purpose was to determine whether omeprazole use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of malformations, spontaneous abortions, decreased birth weight, or perinatal complications. In a multicenter, prospective controlled study, pregnant women exposed to omeprazole during gestation were matched with controls exposed to nonteratogens and with disease-paired controls who used histamine blockers for similar indications. The primary end point was the incidence of major malformations. One hundred thirteen pregnant women were exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy. Rates of major malformations in the omeprazole group (4%) did not differ from controls exposed to nonteratogens (2%) (P = .68, relative risk = 1.94, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 10.36) and disease-paired controls (2.8%). Birth weight, gestational age at delivery, preterm deliveries, and neonatal complications were comparable among the three groups. No association was found between exposure to omeprazole during the period of organogenesis and increased risk for major malformations. Exposure throughout pregnancy is not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortions, decreased birth weight, or perinatal complications.
Summary 2: In nonpregnant adults, proton pump inhibitors are more effective than antacids and H2-blockers for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). No cohort or control studies have been performed on their efficacy in pregnancy. On the basis of animal studies, omeprazole is a category C drug (potential benefit of use should outweigh potential risks). A cohort study of 113 women found no associated anomalies (relative risk=1.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-10.36). Pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole are category B medications.

Query: What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy?
Document: To determine whether ranitidine (Zantac) taken once or twice daily is effective for relieving symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux among pregnant women who had failed conservative measures. Volunteers with heartburn despite antacids were sought among our obstetrics clinic population for this double-blind, placebo-controlled, triple crossover trial. After a baseline week, 20 patients were randomized to receive the three following weekly regimens: ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, placebo in the morning and ranitidine 150 mg in the evening, or placebo twice daily. Daily scores on symptom diaries, global assessments, and number of antacids taken were compared among the 18 patients completing the study. The twice-daily dosage of ranitidine was the only regimen found to reduce heartburn symptoms when compared with the baseline (P < .001) or a placebo (P < .01). Compared with ranitidine taken once daily, the twice-daily dosing prompted less need for antacid tablets compared with the placebo (P < .05 versus P > .05) and to the baseline (P < .001 versus P < .05). The average reduction of heartburn severity using twice-daily ranitidine was 55.6% when compared with baseline (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.8%, 76.5%) was 44.2% when compared with placebo (95% CI 15.4%, 72.9%). This study indicates the efficacy of ranitidine 150 mg taken twice daily, rather than once daily, for relief of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms during pregnancy.
Summary:",A 4-week double-blind randomized control trial found that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily reduced patient symptoms by 44% over placebo (P <.05). This study was limited by its short duration (<1 month) and small sample size (N=30).

Query 1: What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine?
Document 1: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release divalproex sodium compared with placebo in prophylactic monotherapy treatment of migraine headache. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects with more than two migraine headache attacks during a 4-week baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio at each center to receive either extended-release divalproex sodium or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects initiated treatment on 500 mg once daily for 1 week, and the dose was then increased to 1,000 mg once daily with an option, if intolerance occurred, to permanently decrease the dose to 500 mg during the second week. Reduction from baseline in 4-week migraine headache rate was the primary efficacy variable. Migraine headaches separated by a < 24-hour headache-free interval were counted as single migraines in calculating migraine headache rates. Tolerance and safety were also evaluated. The mean reductions in 4-week migraine headache rate were 1.2 (from a baseline mean of 4.4) in the extended-release divalproex sodium group and 0.6 (from a baseline mean of 4.2) in the placebo group (p = 0.006); reductions with extended-release divalproex sodium were significantly greater than with placebo in all three 4-week segments of the treatment period. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups in either the overall incidence or in the incidence of any specific treatment-emergent adverse event; 8% of subjects treated with extended-release divalproex sodium and 9% of those treated with placebo discontinued for adverse events. Extended-release divalproex sodium is an efficacious, well-tolerated, safe, and easy-to-use once-a-day prophylactic antimigraine medication.
Summary 1: A study of the extended-release form of divalproex sodium demonstrated a 4-week reduction in headache rate to 1.2 from a baseline of 4.4, compared with a decrease of 0.6 for placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] of treatment difference, 0.2-1.2).

Query 2: What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine?
Document 2: To evaluate the efficacy of oral treatment with nebivolol and metoprolol in the prophylaxis of migraine attacks. Beta-blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are known to be effective in preventing migraine attacks. Following earlier observations of successful use of nebivolol in a few hypertensive patients with concomitant migraine, we conducted a prospective study to ascertain whether nebivolol would be effective and better tolerated, in a methodologically strict, randomized and double-blind setting. Randomized, double-blind study in 30 patients with confirmed migraine diagnosis, a minimum 1-year history, onset prior to 50 years of age, written records of attacks for the previous 3 months, and minimum 2 attacks per month. Primary endpoint was frequency of attacks (prevention of migraine attacks) in the final 4 weeks of a 14-week treatment on full dose of metoprolol and nebivolol. Secondary endpoints were time to therapeutic effect, duration of attacks, intensity of headache, consumption of analgesics, evaluation of accompanying symptoms, migraine disability assessment, clinical global impression, quality of life, and responder rates. The statistical analysis was prospectively planned and conducted for all randomized patients. Both metoprolol and nebivolol where similarly effective regarding the main endpoint (prevention of migraine attacks) as well as the secondary ones, and both had a fast onset of action, typically within 4 weeks from starting therapy, with responder rates increasing relatively little over time after the first 4 weeks. Use of acute pain medication decreased on both drugs, as well as accompanying symptoms. Both patients' and physicians' evaluations of disability and disease status were similarly favorable to the 2 treatments. Regarding safety, nebivolol was considerably better tolerated than metoprolol in terms of all reported events, treatment-related events, and event severity. Our results suggest that nebivolol is as effective as metoprolol in the prophylaxis of migraine attacks, with the advantages of being better tolerated and not requiring up-titration to achieve therapeutic levels. Further and larger trials should be conducted on nebivolol in the prevention of migraine attacks as it may provide an improvement in current migraine prophylaxis with beta-blockers.
Summary 2: A trial comparing metoprolol and nebivolol demonstrated a positive response-defined as a 50% reduction in headache frequency-to each drug at 14 weeks (57% of metoprolol-treated and 50% of nebivolol-treated patients), but noted that nebivolol was better tolerated.

Query: What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine?
Document: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium (DVPX) when used as prophylactic monotherapy in patients with migraine. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group. Patients were previously untreated or had failed no more than two adequate trials of prophylactic therapy. During the 4-week (single-blind) baseline, patients received placebo and completed a headache diary. Patients with two or more migraine attacks during the baseline were randomized to receive a DVPX daily dose of 500, 1000, or 1500 mg, or to placebo. The experimental phase (EP) lasted 12 weeks, the first 4 weeks for dose escalation to randomized dose, and the remaining 8 weeks for maintenance at that dose. The primary efficacy variable was 4-week migraine attack frequency during the EP. One-hundred-and-seventy-six patients (44 placebo, 132 DVPX) were randomized; 171 provided efficacy data and 137 completed the study. During the EP, after adjustment for differences in baseline migraine attack frequencies, mean reductions in the DVPX groups were 1.7 (500 mg), 2.0 (1000 mg) and 1.7 (1500 mg) migraine attacks per 4 weeks compared to a mean reduction of 0.5 migraine attacks in the placebo group (p < or = 0.05 vs placebo). Forty-four to 45% of DVPX-treated patients compared to 21% of patients in the placebo group achieved > or = 50% reduction in their migraine attack frequencies (p < or = 0.05 vs placebo). The recommended initial dose of DVPX in migraine prophylaxis is 500 mg per day, although some patients may benefit from higher doses. Adverse events were similar in the DVPX and placebo treatment groups except for nausea, dizziness and tremor in which incidence rates were significantly higher in the DVPX 1500 mg group (nausea was also higher in 500 mg group) than in the placebo group. Divalproex sodium is an effective prophylactic treatment in migraine and is generally well tolerated.
Summary:","No evidence from controlled trials supports the use of fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, phenelzine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, trazodone, or bupropion. Initial studies of delayed-release divalproex at doses ranging from 500 to 1500 mg daily found that 44% of divalproex-treated patients reported a 50% reduction in migraine frequency, compared with 21% in the placebo group (number needed to treat [NNT]=4)."

Query 1: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 1: Migraine is a cause of recurrent headache in childhood. The efficacy of sodium valproate is well known in the prophylactic treatment of adult migraine, but there are few studies involving the drug's effect in pediatric migraine. To determine the efficacy of sodium valproate in the prophylactic treatment of childhood migraine. Fifteen children with migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were included in the study. Headache severity was measured and assessed by Algology unit by a using visual analog scale and a numerical rating scale. All of the subjects were asked to keep a headache diary for 8 weeks. Three subjects who had no headache attacks during the baseline period and two cases who were lost to follow up were excluded. Thus, sodium valproate was initiated in 10 subjects (six boys, four girls), 500 mg/night, and the daily dose was increased up to 1000 mg according to blood levels. Their ages ranged from 9 to 17 (mean age 13.6 +/- 3.2 years). Therapy continued for at least 12 weeks. Headache severity as measured via the mean visual analog score was 6.8 +/- 1.8 at baseline and was 0.7 +/- 1.2 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.000). Mean headache attacks per month were 6 +/- 4.2 at baseline and were 0.8 +/- 1.9 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.002). The duration of headache was significantly decreased from a mean of 5.5 +/- 3.9 hours to 1.1 +/- 2.5 hours with treatment (P = 0.001). The observed side effects were dizziness, drowsiness, and increase in appetite; none required drug withdrawal. In two cases, headache attacks recurred after the cessation of valproate, and therapy was restarted. Headache control lasted for six months following cessation of the drug in the remainder of the subjects. Sodium valproate appears to be effective and safe in selected patients with childhood migraine.
Summary 1: A single uncontrolled interventional trial of valproic acid in 10 children showed a significant trend of improvement in frequency (mean of 6 attacks/month to 0.8 attacks/month) and duration (mean 5.5 hours per attack to 1.1 hour).

Query 2: How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail?
Document 2: Chronic daily headache (CDH) associated with long-term misuse of headache medication is a common clinical problem which is refractory to most treatments. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the effect of drug withdrawal therapy in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication. One hundred and one adult patients (74 women and 27 men, aged between 16 and 72 years, mean age 43 years) were evaluated 1-3 months after drug withdrawal therapy had been initiated. The mean headache frequency at baseline was 26.9+/-4.0 days per month. Fifty-seven (56%) patients were significantly improved (defined as at least 50% reduction in number of headache days) after a period of drug withdrawal therapy. Based on the outcome of the drug withdrawal therapy, the patients were divided into three categories: group I, those who had between 0 and 10 headache days per month (n = 41), group II, those who had 11-20 days (n = 37), and group III, those who had 21-30 days (n = 23). The mean headache frequencies in groups I, II and III were 5.6+/-2.8 days, 15.7+/-2.5 days and 28.7+/-2.4 days, respectively. Treatment with amitriptyline was offered to patients in whom no improvement had been achieved. Ten of those 22 patients (36%) experienced a significant (> or = 50%) reduction of headache days. It is concluded that out-patient drug withdrawal therapy is the treatment of choice in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication, and that about one quarter of these CDH patients do not respond to drug withdrawal therapy only.
Summary 2: Medication withdrawal therapy is a treatment strategy for chronic daily headaches associated with the paradoxical induction of headaches by the frequent, long-term use of immediate relief medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, ergotamine, and sumatriptan. A retrospective study tracked 101 men and women who underwent a controlled outpatient withdrawal of their overused medications. Headache diaries kept for 1 to 3 months reflected that 56% of the patients had at least a 50% reduction in headache days after removal of overused drugs. Twenty-two patients who had no success with withdrawal and continued to have headaches were treated with amitriptyline. Subsequently, 10 of these patients experienced a 50% reduction in headache frequency.

Query: What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine?
Document: Migraine is a debilitating condition characterized by a cycle of painful headaches and headache-related symptoms interspersed with periods of worry, distress, and apprehension. The negative impact of migraine on patient functioning, workplace productivity, and other daily activities has been demonstrated through the use of a variety of clinician- and patient-reported assessment tools, including the Migraine-Specific Questionnaire and the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire. In addition to considering the frequency and severity of migraine, clinicians need to encourage more open dialogue with their patients about the impact of this disorder on daily activities and productivity. Only then can the most appropriate course of treatment be determined. Appropriately prescribed acute and preventive therapies should break the cycle of migraine and improve the daily activities of patients with this chronic condition. Divalproex sodium and topiramate are neuromodulators that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prophylaxis (prevention) of migraine headache in adults. Non-FDA-approved neuromodulators sometimes used in the management of migraine headache include gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide. All medications need to be titrated, and treatment-related adverse events need to be managed appropriately. Preventive medications should be taken for at least 2-3 months to ascertain their therapeutic effect.
Summary:","Topiramate has significantly reduced the mean frequency of episodic migraine at doses of 100 to 200 mg daily and also improved secondary end points, including number of migraine days per month, use of acute medication, and daily activity."

Query 1: When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain?
Document 1: Persistent or recurrent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery is often associated with nerve root compression and is treated by repeated operation or, as a last resort, by spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to test our hypothesis that SCS is more likely than reoperation to result in a successful outcome by standard measures of pain relief and treatment outcome, including subsequent use of health care resources. For an average of 3 years postoperatively, disinterested third-party interviewers followed 50 patients selected for reoperation by standard criteria and randomized to SCS or reoperation. If the results of the randomized treatment were unsatisfactory, patients could cross over to the alternative. Success was based on self-reported pain relief and patient satisfaction. Crossover to the alternative procedure was an outcome measure. Use of analgesics, activities of daily living, and work status were self-reported. Among 45 patients (90%) available for follow-up, SCS was more successful than reoperation (9 of 19 patients versus 3 of 26 patients, P <0.01). Patients initially randomized to SCS were significantly less likely to cross over than were those randomized to reoperation (5 of 24 patients versus 14 of 26 patients, P=0.02). Patients randomized to reoperation required increased opiate analgesics significantly more often than those randomized to SCS (P <0.025). Other measures of activities of daily living and work status did not differ significantly. SCS is more effective than reoperation as a treatment for persistent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery, and in the great majority of patients, it obviates the need for reoperation.
Summary 1: SCS can be used to treat patients with chronic and intractable pain, such as the pain caused by failed back surgery syndrome. The syndrome, defined as persistent or recurrent pain after lumbosacral spine surgery, occurs in 10% to 40% of patients who have undergone lumbosacral spine surgery.

Query 2: When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain?
Document 2: The purpose of this report was to examine the available literature to determine the safety and efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk and limbs. The author identified 68 studies that fulfilled the efficacy inclusion/exclusion criteria, grouped on the basis of pain indication, with an overall population of 3679 patients. Fifty-one studies fulfilled all safety inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on the literature review, the author found that SCS had a positive, symptomatic, long-term effect in cases of refractory angina pain, severe ischemic limb pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathic pain, and chronic low-back pain, and that, in general, SCS was a safe and effective treatment for a variety of chronic neuropathic conditions. Despite the positive findings, there is an urgent need for randomized, controlled, long-term studies on the efficacy of SCS involving larger patient sample sizes.
Summary 2: A 2004 systematic review of SCS for all indications included 51 studies and 2973 patients. Sixteen of the studies, with a total of 616 patients, focused on low back pain, specifically chronic back pain and failed back surgery syndrome. Two of the 16 studies were prospective controlled trials, 8 were prospective trials without controls, and 6 were retrospective studies. Both prospective, controlled trials (total of 62 patients) demonstrated statistically significant (P<.05) results with SCS. One measured subjective pain and the other used crossover to the other treatment arm (SCS vs surgery) as a marker for treatment failure.

Query 1: What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise?
Document 1: The Guide to Community Preventive Service's methods for systematic reviews were used to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to increasing physical activity: informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy approaches. Changes in physical activity behavior and aerobic capacity were used to assess effectiveness. Two informational interventions (""point-of-decision"" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom-based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity). These recommendations should serve the needs of researchers, planners, and other public health decision makers.
Summary 1: Insufficient evidence exists to support other interventions, such as classroom-based informational health education, mass media campaigns, college-based health and physical education, and classroom-based education focused on reducing television viewing and video-game playing.

Query: What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise?
Document: Without detailed evidence of their effectiveness, pedometers have recently become popular as a tool for motivating physical activity. To evaluate the association of pedometer use with physical activity and health outcomes among outpatient adults. English-language articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport Discus, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Thompson Scientific (formerly known as Thompson ISI), and ERIC (1966-2007); bibliographies of retrieved articles; and conference proceedings. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported an assessment of pedometer use among adult outpatients, reported a change in steps per day, and included more than 5 participants. DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently abstracted data about the intervention; participants; number of steps per day; and presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Data were pooled using random-effects calculations, and meta-regression was performed. Our searches identified 2246 citations; 26 studies with a total of 2767 participants met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 18 observational studies). The participants' mean (SD) age was 49 (9) years and 85% were women. The mean intervention duration was 18 weeks. In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P < .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95% CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P < .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9% over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10,000 steps per day (P = .001). When data from all studies were combined, pedometer users significantly decreased their body mass index by 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05-0.72; P = .03). This decrease was associated with older age (P = .001) and having a step goal (P = .04). Intervention participants significantly decreased their systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.7-5.9 mm Hg, P < .001). This decrease was associated with greater baseline systolic blood pressure (P = .009) and change in steps per day (P = .08). The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure. Whether these changes are durable over the long term is undetermined.
Summary:","A systematic review using meta-regression to calculate summary effects evaluated the use of pedometers by study participants for an average of 18 weeks. Pedometer users increased their physical activity significantly, by 2491 steps per day compared with controls (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day)."

Document 1: The majority of children do not participate in sufficient amounts of daily, health-enhancing physical activity. One strategy to increase activity is to promote it within the after-school setting. Although promising, the effectiveness of this strategy is unclear. A systematic review was performed summarizing the research conducted to date regarding the effectiveness of after-school programs in increasing physical activity. Databases, journals, and review articles were searched for articles published between 1980 and February 2008. Meta-analysis was conducted during July of 2008. Included articles had the following characteristics: findings specific to an after-school intervention in the school setting; subjects aged <or=18 years; an intervention component designed to promote physical activity; outcome measures of physical activity, related constructs, and/or physical fitness. Study outcomes were distilled into six domains: physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, blood lipids, psychosocial constructs, and sedentary activities. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated within and across studies for each domain, separately. Of the 797 articles found, 13 unique articles describing findings from 11 after-school interventions were reviewed. Although physical activity was a primary component of all the tested interventions, only eight studies measured physical activity. From the six domains, positive effect sizes were demonstrated for physical activity (0.44 [95% CI=0.28-0.60]); physical fitness (0.16 [95% CI=0.01-0.30]); body composition (0.07 [95% CI=0.03-0.12]); and blood lipids (0.20 [95% CI=0.06-0.33]). The limited evidence suggests that after-school programs can improve physical activity levels and other health-related aspects. Additional studies are required that provide greater attention to theoretical rationale, levels of implementation, and measures of physical activity within and outside the intervention.
Summary 1: A US meta-analysis of 11 after-school programs with an average contact time of 275 minutes per week showed a positive standardized mean difference effect size for physical activity (0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.60).

Document: To review the published literature on the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in children and adolescents. Systematic review. Literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, Psychlit, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, and Embase up to December 2006. Two independent reviewers assessed studies against the following inclusion criteria: controlled trial, comparison of intervention to promote physical activity with no intervention control condition, participants younger than 18 years, and reported statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome measure. Levels of evidence, accounting for methodological quality, were assessed for three types of intervention, five settings, and three target populations. The literature search identified 57 studies: 33 aimed at children and 24 at adolescents. Twenty four studies were of high methodological quality, including 13 studies in children. Interventions that were found to be effective achieved increases ranging from an additional 2.6 minutes of physical education related physical activity to 283 minutes per week of overall physical activity. Among children, limited evidence for an effect was found for interventions targeting children from low socioeconomic populations, and environmental interventions. Strong evidence was found that school based interventions with involvement of the family or community and multicomponent interventions can increase physical activity in adolescents. Some evidence was found for potentially effective strategies to increase children's levels of physical activity. For adolescents, multicomponent interventions and interventions that included both school and family or community involvement have the potential to make important differences to levels of physical activity and should be promoted. A lack of high quality evaluations hampers conclusions concerning effectiveness, especially among children.
Summary:",A British systematic review of 24 high-quality controlled trials involving adolescents and children reported significant improvements with interventions that were school-based and either community- or family-based. Multidimensional outcomes included a 42% increase in participation in regular physical activity and an increase of 83 minutes weekly in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

Query 1: Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis?
Document 1: Repeated infection with C trachomatis increases the risk for serious sequelae: pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. A substantial proportion of women treated for C trachomatis infection are reinfected by an untreated male sex partner in the first several months after treatment. Effective strategies to ensure partner treatment are needed. The goal of the study was to determine whether repeated infections with C trachomatis can be reduced by giving women doses of azithromycin to deliver to male sex partners. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1,787 women aged 14 to 34 years with uncomplicated C trachomatis genital infection diagnosed at family planning, adolescent, sexually transmitted disease, and primary care clinics or emergency or other hospital departments in five US cities. Women treated for infection were randomized to one of two groups: patient-delivered partner treatment (in which they were given a dose of azithromycin to deliver to each sex partner) or self-referral (in which they were asked to refer their sex partners for treatment). The main outcome measure was C trachomatis DNA detected by urine ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by 4 months after treatment. The characteristics of study participants enrolled in each arm were similar except for a small difference in the age distribution. Risk of reinfection was 20% lower among women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm (87/728; 12%) than among those in the self-referral arm (106/726; 15%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.05; = 0.102). Women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm reported high compliance with the intervention (82%). Patient-delivered partner treatment for prevention of repeated infection among women is comparable to self-referral and may be an appropriate option for some patients.
Summary 1: One randomized controlled trials showed a statistically significant reduction in recurrent or persistent urethritis, but did not report persistent and recurrent gonorrheal and chlamydial infections separately. The randomized controlled trials showed a statistically significant decrease in recurrent or persistent urethritis, but without identifying recurrent gonorrheal and chlamydial infections separately.

Query 2: Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis?
Document 2: Infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common and recurrence rates are high. Better methods of treating partners of women with trichomoniasis are needed. To determine if patient-delivered partner treatment (PDPT) is better and more cost-effective than partner referral. Women attending a family planning clinic who were culture-positive and treated for TV (N = 463) were randomized to either standard partner referral (PR), booklet-enhanced partner referral (BEPR), or PDPT. At baseline and 1 month, women were interviewed and cultured for TV. Detailed cost information was also collected. Most women had 1 partner, were less than 24 years old, and were black. The percentage of women reporting that their partners were treated was similar for PDPT but significantly lower for BEPR compared to PR. TV follow-up rates were similar. PDPT cost less and was cost saving compared to PR and BEPR. Among women with TV, PDPT did not result in more partners taking the medicine or lower follow-up rates than PR but was less costly.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials showed a decrease in recurrent or persistent chlamydial infection in the index patient, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The randomized controlled trials demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in persistent or recurrent gonococcal infection for expedited partner treatment for gonorrhea.

Query: Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis?
Document: Many sex partners of persons with gonorrhea or chlamydial infections are not treated, which leads to frequent reinfections and further transmission. We randomly assigned women and heterosexual men with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection to have their partners receive expedited treatment or standard referral. Patients in the expedited-treatment group were offered medication to give to their sex partners, or if they preferred, study staff members contacted partners and provided them with medication without a clinical examination. Patients assigned to standard partner referral were advised to refer their partners for treatment and were offered assistance notifying partners. The primary outcome was persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection in patients 3 to 19 weeks after treatment. Persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection occurred in 121 of 931 patients (13 percent) assigned to standard partner referral and 92 of 929 (10 percent) assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98). Expedited treatment was more effective than standard referral of partners in reducing persistent or recurrent infection among patients with gonorrhea (3 percent vs. 11 percent, P=0.01) than in those with chlamydial infection (11 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.17) (P=0.05 for the comparison of treatment effects) and remained independently associated with a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection after adjustment for other predictors of infection at follow-up (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.97). Patients assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners were significantly more likely than those assigned to standard referral of partners to report that all of their partners were treated and significantly less likely to report having sex with an untreated partner. Expedited treatment of sex partners reduces the rates of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection.
Summary:",One RCT compared expedited partner therapy with patient referral for patients with trichomoniasis. The study did not show a statistically significant difference in recurrent or persistent infection.

Query 1: What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children?
Document 1: Optimal medications for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be effective, well tolerated, and long acting and not cause mood swings or worsen comorbid conditions. Current medications work on brain dopamine and/or norepinephrine systems, which are thought to be involved in ADHD. The medication class with the most evidence of efficacy in ADHD is stimulants, but they may be abused, are effective for only 4 to 12 hours, and may cause mood swings or increase tic severity. In recent years, alternative treatments have been explored. Tricyclic antidepressants have efficacy comparable to that of stimulants but may cause constipation, dry mouth, tremors, blood pressure changes, and potentially serious side effects including cardiac conduction and repolarization delays. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may improve ADHD symptoms but are associated with severe dietary restrictions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have little or no effect in ADHD but may improve comorbid depression. Bupropion, although less effective than stimulants, may improve both ADHD symptoms and comorbid depression. Antihypertensive agents may improve impulsivity, hyperactivity, and comorbid tics but cause sedation or rebound hypertension. Atomoxetine, which is being developed for ADHD, reduces symptoms of ADHD without exacerbating comorbid conditions and is associated with only minor side effects, including subtle changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Before prescribing a treatment, physicians should consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any medication for children with ADHD, who may be less tolerant of side effects and less able to monitor and express concerns about their well-being than adults.
Summary 1: Second-line medications such as clonidine, pemoline (Cylert), and tricyclic antidepressants have more potential serious side effects and are not well studied.

Query 2: What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children?
Document 2: Studies examining interventions for adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reviewed to evaluate their efficacy. These efficacy findings were supplemented with a preliminary system for judging safety and practicality. Results suggest that the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) is safe and well-established empirically, but has some problems with inconvenience and noncompliance. Preliminary research supports the efficacy, safety, and practicality of some psychotherapeutic interventions, including behavioral classroom interventions, note-taking training, and family therapy. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was judged to have minimal empirical support and debatable safety. Very little is known about long-term effectiveness of treatments, long-term compliance, or multimodal treatments for adolescents such as stimulants plus behavior therapy.
Summary 2: Several short-term reviews and meta-analyses show that side effects from stimulant medications are mild and have short duration. More long-term studies are required to evaluate effects on growth.

Query: What is the most effective treatment for ADHD in children?
Document: The treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) has been problematic because methylphenidate (MPH)--the most commonly used drug to treat ADHD--has been reported to worsen tics and because clonidine (CLON)--the most commonly prescribed alternative--has unproven efficacy. The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 136 children with ADHD and a chronic tic disorder were randomly administered CLON alone, MPH alone, combined CLON + MPH, or placebo (2 x 2 factorial design). Each subject participated for 16 weeks (weeks 1-4 CLON/placebo dose titration, weeks 5-8 added MPH/placebo dose titration, weeks 9-16 maintenance therapy). Thirty-seven children were administered MPH alone, 34 were administered CLON alone, 33 were administered CLON + MPH, and 32 were administered placebo. For our primary outcome measure of ADHD (Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire--Teacher), significant improvement occurred for subjects assigned to CLON (p < 0.002) and those assigned to MPH (p < 0.003). Compared with placebo, the greatest benefit occurred with combined CLON + MPH (p < 0.0001). CLON appeared to be most helpful for impulsivity and hyperactivity; MPH appeared to be most helpful for inattention. The proportion of individual subjects reporting a worsening of tics as an adverse effect was no higher in those treated with MPH (20%) than those being administered CLON alone (26%) or placebo (22%). Compared with placebo, measured tic severity lessened in all active treatment groups in the following order: CLON + MPH, CLON alone, MPH alone. Sedation was common with CLON treatment (28% reported moderate or severe sedation), but otherwise the drugs were tolerated well, including absence of any evident cardiac toxicity. Methylphenidate and clonidine (particularly in combination) are effective for ADHD in children with comorbid tics. Prior recommendations to avoid methylphenidate in these children because of concerns of worsening tics are unsupported by this trial.
Summary:","One RCT of 136 children with ADHD and tics showed improvement of both problems with the use of methylphenidate and clonidine, particularly in combination."

Query 1: What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents?
Document 1: To determine by meta-analysis the effect size for stimulants on overt and covert aggression-related behaviors in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), separately from stimulant effects on the core symptoms of ADHD. A review of the literature from 1970 to 2001 revealed 28 studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. These studies yielded 28 independent effects of overt aggression and 7 independent effects of covert aggression. The overall weighted mean effect size was 0.84 for overt and 0.69 for covert aggression related behaviors in ADHD. Comorbid conduct disorder is associated with diminishing stimulant effect size for overt aggression. Stimulant effects for aggression-related behaviors in ADHD have effect sizes similar to those for the core symptoms of ADHD.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis evaluated 28 studies of stimulant medication (methylphenidate, amphetamine, or pemoline) for children with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ODD. A total of 683 patients aged 8 to 18 years were included. Stimulants reduced aggression-related behaviors in these children by an effect size of 0.84 for overt aggression and 0.69 for covert aggression. Stimulants typically reduce aggressive behaviors by similar effect sizes when prescribed for children with attention deficit disorder alone. The study groups did not separate children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder from those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder; they also grouped adolescents together with younger children.

Summary:","In treating oppositional behaviors among children with ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, a meta-analysis identified 28 studies of children age 7 to 15 years that addressed oppositional/aggression-related behaviors within the context of ADHD. The analysis found that stimulants are efficacious. The overall weighted effect size a measure of improvement representing the average effects across all reporters was 0.89. This indicates that raters saw a change in oppositional behaviors-noncompliance, irritability, and temper tantrums-that corresponded to a drop in scores of approximately 1 standard deviation."

Query 1: What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma?
Document 1: Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion of the skin and mucous membranes. Many different treatments have been used, with variable success rates. To evaluate and compare the effects of cryotherapy and curettage in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. Eighty-nine patients with pyogenic granuloma were randomized to receive cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or curettage and electrodesiccation. Forty patients in the cryotherapy group and 36 patients in the curettage group completed the study period. Among the patients who completed the study, treatment resulted in complete resolution of all lesions after one to three sessions (mean 1.42) in the cryotherapy group and after one to two sessions (mean 1.03) in the curettage group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Twenty-three patients (57.5%) in the cryotherapy group and 25 patients (69%) in the curettage group had no scar or pigmentation abnormality. Except for cosmetic problems, no other side-effect or complication was recorded in the study. This study showed that both cryotherapy and curettage are safe and effective. Curettage had the advantage of fewer treatment sessions required to achieve resolution and better cosmetic results. We suggest that curettage could be the first-line treatment for pyogenic granuloma.
Summary 1: A prospective trial randomized 89 patients (mean age 34 years; range 11-88 years) with pyogenic granulomas that were 1.5 cm or smaller to receive either curettage or cryotherapy, then evaluated the number of treatments required and whether scarring occurred. Follow-up was 85%. A single curettage resolved pyogenic granuloma in 35 of 36 patients (97%); 9 of the 36 patients (31%) had residual scarring. Twenty-five of 40 pyogenic granulomas (63%) responded to 1 cryotherapy treatment, 13 lesions (32%) resolved after 2 treatments, and 2 (5%) resolved after 3 treatments; 17 of the 40 patients (42.5%) had a residual scar. Curettage required fewer treatments overall than cryotherapy (P<.001), but no significant difference in residual scarring was noted between the 2 treatments.

Query 2: What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma?
Document 2: Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, acquired, proliferative vascular lesion of the skin and mucous membranes. Many different treatments have been used for pyogenic granuloma with variable success rates. To evaluate the efficacy of cryotherapy in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. In a prospective observational study, 135 patients with pyogenic granuloma were treated with cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen. The patients were followed up every 3 weeks until 3 months after disappearance of the lesion. Complete resolution of the pyogenic granuloma was achieved in all patients after a mean of 1.58 treatments (range, 1-4 treatments). At the end of follow-up period, there was a flat imperceptible scar, smaller than the treated lesion, in 16 patients (11.8%). A hypertrophic scar, 3 mm in diameter, was observed in one patient. Hypopigmentation was observed in seven patients (5.1%). No other complication or side-effect was recorded in the study. We believe that pyogenic granuloma can be treated simply and effectively with cryotherapy.
Summary 2: A case series reported on 135 patients (mean age 26 years; range 4 months to 70 years) whose pyogenic granulomas were treated with cryotherapy. Seventy-eight (58%) had complete resolution with 1 session, 30% needed 2 sessions, 8% needed 3 sessions, and 5% needed 4 sessions (mean 1.58 sessions). Ninety-four percent had an excellent cosmetic result (including 12% with a small flat scar); 5% had residual hypopigmentation.

Query: What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma?
Document: Pyogenic granulomas have been treated by cryosurgery, curettage, electrodesiccation, chemical cauterization, and laser surgery. The therapeutic effects of these conservative treatments are limited, however. In this study, the efficacy of a sclerosing agent (monoethanolamine oleate) was evaluated for the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granuloma was treated by local injection of the monoethanolamine oleate solution in nine patients who were from 1 to 57 years of age (median 18 years). The treatment effect was determined by physical examination. All lesions were removed completely with no recurrence, and scars were inconspicuous in all cases. Complications occurred in only one patient who complained of pain due to an avoidable injection of excess solution. Sclerotherapy with monoethanolamine oleate is effective in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma and offers an alternative to conventional methods in cases for which conservative treatment is preferable.
Summary:",A case series reported results in 9 patients (median age 18 years; range 1-57 years) with pyogenic granuloma treated with a single injection of the sclerosing agent monoethanolamine oleate. All lesions disappeared without recurrence; the authors described remaining scars as inconspicuous. One patient reported residual pain lasting 4 weeks after injection of the sclerosing agent into a 1.5 cm x 1.0 cm pyogenic granuloma that hadn't responded to previous cryotherapy.

Query 1: Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids?
Document 1: Despite an abundance of nonsurgical hemorrhoid therapies, none has been consistently more efficacious. By combining data from multiple clinical trials in a meta-analysis, the present study compared the efficacy and complications of infrared coagulation, injection sclerotherapy, and rubber band ligation to determine the optimal nonoperative hemorrhoid treatment. All published clinical trials comparing the three methods were identified by computer search and review of appropriate English language journals. Five trials studying 863 patients satisfied all inclusion criteria. Results demonstrated that similar numbers of patients were asymptomatic 12 months after treatment, regardless of initial therapy. However, significantly fewer patients undergoing rubber band ligation required additional treatment because symptoms had recurred. Although rubber band ligation demonstrated greater long-term efficacy, it was associated with a significantly higher incidence of posttreatment pain. In contrast, infrared coagulation was associated with both fewer and less severe complications. Thus, when all factors are considered, infrared coagulation may in fact be the optimal nonoperative hemorrhoid treatment.
Summary 1: Rubber band ligation had the lowest recurrence rate at 12 months compared with the other nonoperative techniques of sclerotherapy and infrared coagulation.

Query 2: Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids?
Document 2: The procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) has been introduced as an alternative to conventional hemorrhoidectomy. This is a systematic review on stapled hemorrhoidopexy of all randomized, controlled trials that have been published until August 2006. All published, randomized, controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional hemorrhoidectomy were identified from Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and all Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, Cochrane Database of Systemic Review, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) between January 1991 and August 2006. Meta-analysis was performed by using the Forest plot review if feasible. A total of 25 randomized, controlled trials with 1,918 procedures were reviewed. The follow-up duration was from 1 to 62 months. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was associated with less operating time (weighted mean difference, -11.35 minutes; P = 0.006), earlier return of bowel function (weighted mean difference -9.91 hours; P < 0.00001), and shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -1.07 days; P = 0.0004). There was less pain after stapled hemorrhoidopexy, as evidenced by lower pain scores at rest and on defecation and 37.6 percent reduction in analgesic requirement. The stapled hemorrhoidopexy allowed a faster functional recovery with shorter time off work (weighted mean difference, -8.45 days; P < 0.00001), earlier return to normal activities (weighted mean difference, -15.85 days; P = 0.03), and better wound healing (odds ratio, 0.1; P = 0.0006). The patients' satisfaction was significantly higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy than conventional hemorrhoidectomy (odds ratio, 2.33; P = 0.003). Although there was increase in the recurrence of hemorrhoids at one year or more after stapled procedure (5.7 vs. 1 percent; odds ratio, 3.48; P = 0.02), the overall incidence of recurrent hemorrhoidal symptoms--early (fewer than 6 months; stapled vs. conventional: 24.8 vs. 31.7 percent; P = 0.08) or late (1 year or more) recurrence rate (stapled vs. conventional: 25.3 vs. 18.7 percent; P = 0.07)--was similar. The overall complication rate did not differ significantly from that of conventional procedure (stapled vs. conventional: 20.2 vs. 25.2 percent; P = 0.06). Compared with conventional surgery, stapled hemorrhoidopexy has less postoperative bleeding (odds ratio, 0.52; P = 0.001), wound complication (odds ratio, 0.05; P = 0.005), constipation (odds ratio, 0.45; P = 0.02), and pruritus (odds ratio, 0.19; P = 0.02). The overall need of surgical (odds ratio, 1.27; P = 0.4) and nonsurgical (odds ratio, 1.07; P = 0.82) reintervention after the two procedures was similar. The Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoid (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) is safe with many short-term benefits. The long-term results are similar to conventional procedure.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 25 studies, including some that were of lower quality, showed a higher recurrence rate at 1 year with stapled hemorrhoidectomy than with conventional surgery.

Query: Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids?
Document: This review compares the two most popular treatments for haemorrhoids, namely rubber band ligation (RBL) and excisional haemorrhoidectomy. Randomized trials were identified from the major electronic databases. Symptom control, retreatment, postoperative pain, complications, time off work and patient satisfaction were assessed. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference with 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) were estimated using a random-effects model for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. Three trials met the inclusion criteria and all were of poor methodological quality. Complete remission of haemorrhoidal symptoms was better after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 1.68 (95 per cent c.i 1.00 to 2.83)). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 90.5 per cent; P < 0.001). Fewer patients required retreatment after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 0.20 (95 per cent c.i 0.09 to 0.40)), but anal stenosis, postoperative haemorrhage and incontinence to flatus were more common with this operation. Haemorrhoidectomy produced better long-term symptom control in patients with grade III haemorrhoids, but was associated with more postoperative complications than RBL.
Summary:",A systematic review of 3 poor-quality trials comparing rubber band ligation with excisional hemorrhoidectomy in patients with grade III hemorrhoids found that excisional hemorrhoidectomy produced better long-term symptom control but more immediate postoperative complications of anal stenosis and hemorrhage.

Query 1: What is the best treatment for chronic constipation in the elderly?
Document 1: Constipation is a common cause of general practice consultations in elderly people, and laxative use is common among this group of patients. However, there appears to be little evidence to guide laxative treatment in this population. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of laxatives in the treatment of constipation in the elderly. While the results of the review suggest that laxatives can improve bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, and symptoms of constipation, with a few exceptions, the relevant trials have serious methodological shortcomings. However, the review finds little evidence of marked differences in effectiveness between laxatives and, in particular, there appears to be no evidence to support the current National Health Service (NHS) trend towards prescribing the more expensive stimulant laxatives. This is an area where good quality trial evidence is now needed.
Summary 1: Two good-quality systematic reviews looked at 10 RCTs comparing laxatives with placebo, and 10 RCTs comparing 1 laxative with another. The studies generally had few participants, were of short duration, and were conducted in institutional settings. Most lacked power to make valid conclusions. These studies varied in the reported outcome measures, including stool frequency, stool consistency, straining, decrease in laxative use, and symptom scores. The reviews concluded that the best pharmacologic treatment for chronic constipation in the elderly has not been established.

Query 2: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 2: Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives. The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis. The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field. All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the administering of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment. No trials were found that met the selection criteria. No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria. The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.
Summary 2: A Cochrane systematic review found no RCTs of stimulant laxatives for chronic functional constipation of children and concluded that evidence concerning the efficacy of these agents is insufficient.

Query: Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids?
Document: Symptomatic hemorrhoids are a common medical condition, which increase in prevalence in women during pregnancy and postpartum. Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost. To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field. We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures. Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality. The use of fiber shows a consistent beneficial effect for relieving overall symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.
Summary:","A Cochrane systematic review of 7 RCTs enrolling a total of 378 patients with grade I to III hemorrhoids evaluated the effect of fiber supplements on pain, itching, and bleeding. Persistent hemorrhoid symptoms decreased by 53% in the group receiving fiber."

Query 1: How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia?
Document 1: The effects of dietary soluble fibers on blood cholesterol are uncertain. This meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials was performed to quantify the cholesterol-lowering effect of major dietary fibers. Least-squares regression analyses were used to test the effect on blood lipids of pectin, oat bran, guar gum, and psyllium. Independent variables were type and amount of soluble fiber, initial cholesterol concentration, and other important study characteristics. Soluble fiber, 2-10 g/d, was associated with small but significant decreases in total cholesterol [-0.045 mmol L(-1).g soluble fiber(-1) (95% CI: -0.054, -0.035)] and LDL cholesterol [-0.057 mmol.L(-1).g(-1) (95% CI: -0.070, -0.044)]. The effects on plasma lipids of soluble fiber from oat, psyllium, or pectin were not significantly different. We were unable to compare effects of guar because of the limited number of studies using 2-10 g/d. Triacylglycerols and HDL cholesterol were not significantly influenced by soluble fiber. Lipid changes were independent of study design, treatment length, and background dietary fat content. Various soluble fibers reduce total and LDL cholesterol by similar amounts. The effect is small within the practical range of intake. For example, 3 g soluble fiber from oats (3 servings of oatmeal, 28 g each) can decrease total and LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.13 mmol/L. Increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution to dietary therapy to lower cholesterol.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 67 good-quality RCTs evaluated the effects of soluble dietary fiber in 2990 subjects (mean baseline lipid values [mg/dL]: total cholesterol, 240.9; LDL, 164.4). Diets high in soluble fiber (average dose of 9.5 g/d) were associated with a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein and no significant change in high density lipoprotein or triglycerides. Type of fiber (oat, psyllium, or pectin) was not influential after controlling for initial lipid level.

Query 2: How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia?
Document 2: Epidemiologic studies link Mediterranean-type diets to a low incidence of cardiovascular disease; however, few dietary intervention studies have been undertaken, especially in primary prevention. In the Mediterranean Diet, Cardiovascular Risks and Gene Polymorphisms (Medi-RIVAGE) study, the effects of a Mediterranean-type diet (Med group) or a low-fat diet (low-fat group) on risk factors were evaluated in 212 volunteers (men and women) with moderate risk factors for cardiovascular disease. After the 3-mo dietary intervention, changes in many risk factors were evaluated. Dietary questionnaires and plasma nutritional markers were used to test compliance. Although the dietary goals were only partially reached, changes in dietary habits were observed in both groups (n = 169): protein, carbohydrate, and fiber intakes increased and fat quality (decreased saturated fat and increased monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat) improved. BMI, total and triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol, triacylglycerols, TRL triacylglycerols, apolipoproteins A-I and B, insulinemia, glycemia, and the homeostasis model assessment score were significantly lower after 3 mo. The reductions in total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and insulinemia remained significant after adjustment for BMI. There was a trend for a diet-by-time interaction for LDL cholesterol (P = 0.09). Our data predicted a 9% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk with the low-fat diet and a 15% reduction with this particular Mediterranean diet. After a 3-mo intervention, both diets significantly reduced cardiovascular disease risk factors to an overall comparable extent.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials with 88 participants reported reduced low density lipoprotein among subjects assigned to a Mediterranean-type diet. Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were total cholesterol, 255.22; LDL, 170.15; HDL, 58.01; triglycerides, 141.71.

Query: How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia?
Document: Plasma lipid and lipoprotein responses have been variable in dietary intervention studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step I and Step II dietary interventions on major cardiovascular disease risk factors using meta-analysis. MEDLINE was used to select 37 dietary intervention studies in free-living subjects published from 1981 to 1997. Step I and Step II dietary interventions significantly decreased plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and TC:HDL cholesterol decreased by 0.63 mmol/L (10%), 0.49 mmol/L (12%), 0.17 mmol/L (8%), and 0.50 (10%), respectively, in Step I intervention studies, and by 0.81 mmol/L (13%), 0.65 mmol/L (16%), 0.19 mmol/L (8%), and 0.34 (7%), respectively, in Step II intervention studies (P < 0.01 for all). HDL cholesterol decreased by 7% (P = 0.05) in response to Step II but not to Step I dietary interventions. Positive correlations between changes in dietary total and saturated fatty acids and changes in TC and LDL and HDL cholesterol were observed (r = 0.59, 0.61, and 0.46, respectively; P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that for every 1% decrease in energy consumed as dietary saturated fatty acid, TC decreased by 0.056 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol by 0.05 mmol/L. Moreover, for every 1-kg decrease in body weight, triacylglycerol decreased by 0.011 mmol/L and HDL cholesterol increased by 0.011 mmol/L. Exercise resulted in greater decreases in TC, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol and prevented the decrease in HDL cholesterol associated with low-fat diets. Step I and Step II dietary interventions have multiple beneficial effects on important cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 37 mostly good-quality controlled trials evaluated the former National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step I and Step II diets in 11,586 participants. The Step I diet restricted in-take of total fat (≤30% of total calories), saturated fat (≤10% of total calories), and cholesterol (≤300 mg/d). Step II goals were lower for saturated fat (<7%) and cholesterol (<200 mg/d). Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were total cholesterol, 233.57; LDL, 155.10; HDL, 47.95; and triglycerides, 147.91. Both of these low-fat diets significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. The Step II diet also reduced HDL."

Query 1: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 1: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 1: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query 2: Can patients with steatohepatitis take statins?
Document 2: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of three hypolipidemic agents in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with hyperlipidemia. Patients with dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), asymptomatic persistent transaminasemia lasting 24 weeks, and evidence of hepatic fat infiltration on ultrasonography and liver biopsy were studied. Those with predominant hypertriglyceridemia received omega-3 fatty acids (5 mL thrice daily) (Group A), those with predominant hypercholesterolemia received atorvastatin 20 mg/daily (Group B), and overweight patients received orlistat 120 mg thrice daily before meals (Group C). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum transaminase and lipid levels and liver ultrasonography were repeated. Serum transaminase levels decreased significantly (p< 0.001) in all groups but the decrease was more marked in Group C (AST 75 [16] to 31 [7] IU/L; ALT 120 [38] to 41 [10] IU/L) than in Group A (AST 70 [14] to 41 [6]; ALT 110 [20] to 68 [12]) or Group B (AST 68 [13] to 46 [9]; ALT 115 [22] to 76.6 [13]). After treatment, ultrasonography showed resolution of fatty liver in 35% of patients in Group A, 61% in Group B, and in 86% in Group C (p< 0.001, Group C vs. A). A decline in transaminase levels and normalization of ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver were observed on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, with atorvastatin in those with hypercholesterolemia, and orlistat in overweight patients with hyperlipidemia.
Summary 2: Another study included patients with biopsy-confirmed fatty liver and elevated alanine transaminase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. In this 24-week study, 23 predominantly hypertriglyceridemic patients took omega-3 fatty acids, 5 mL 3 times daily, 28 hypercholesterolemic patients took atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and 21 dyslipidemic patients with a body mass index >27.0 took orlistat 120 mg 3 times daily. alanine transaminase levels decreased in all 3 groups during the study. Ultrasonography showed normal liver echo pattern at the end of treatment for 35% of omega-3 patients, 61% of atorvastatin patients, and 86% of orlistat patients. No serious adverse events were observed.

Query: How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia?
Document: 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce serum cholesterol and are increasingly advocated in primary prevention to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol. Newer dietary approaches combining cholesterol-lowering foods may offer another option, but these approaches have not been compared directly with statins in the same persons. The objective was to compare, in the same subjects, the cholesterol-lowering potential of a dietary portfolio with that of a statin. Thirty-four hyperlipidemic participants underwent all three 1-mo treatments in random order as outpatients: a very-low-saturated-fat diet (control diet), the same diet plus 20 mg lovastatin (statin diet), and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy-protein foods (including soy milks and soy burgers, 21.4 g/1000 kcal), almonds (14 g/1000 kcal), and viscous fibers from oats, barley, psyllium, and the vegetables okra and eggplant (10 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio diets). Fasting blood samples were obtained at 0, 2, and 4 wk. LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by 8.5+/-1.9%, 33.3+/-1.9%, and 29.6+/-1.3% after 4 wk of the control, statin, and portfolio diets, respectively. Although the absolute difference between the statin and the portfolio treatments was significant at 4 wk (P=0.013), 9 participants (26%) achieved their lowest LDL-cholesterol concentrations with the portfolio diet. Moreover, the statin (n=27) and the portfolio (n=24) diets did not differ significantly (P=0.288) in their ability to reduce LDL cholesterol below the 3.4-mmol/L primary prevention cutoff. Dietary combinations may not differ in potency from first-generation statins in achieving current lipid goals for primary prevention. They may, therefore, bridge the treatment gap between current therapeutic diets and newer statins.
Summary:","A randomized crossover study with 34 participants found that a ""portfolio diet"", which combines the fat intake of the NCEP Step II diet with cholesterol-lowering ""functional foods"" (including plant sterols, nuts, soluble fibers, and soy protein), markedly reduced total cholesterol and LDL. Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were: total cholesterol, 261.41; LDL, 174.40; HDL, 47.56; triglycerides, 199.28."

Query 1: How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain?
Document 1: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. To assess the effectiveness of the most common conservative types of treatment for patients with acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain. Many treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are available, but little is known about the optimal treatment strategy. A rating system was used to assess the strength of the evidence, based on the methodologic quality of the randomized controlled trials, the relevance of the outcome measures, and the consistency of the results. The number of randomized controlled trials identified varied widely with regard to the interventions involved. The scores ranged from 20 to 79 points for acute low back pain and from 19 to 79 points for chronic low back pain on a 100-point scale, indicating the overall poor quality of the trials. Overall, only 28 (35%) randomized controlled trials on acute low back pain and 20 (25%) on chronic low back pain had a methodologic score of 50 or more points, and were considered to be of high quality. Various methodologic flaws were identified. Strong evidence was found for the effectiveness of muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the ineffectiveness of exercise therapy for acute low back pain; strong evidence also was found for the effectiveness of manipulation, back schools, and exercise therapy for chronic low back pain, especially for short-term effects. The quality of the design, execution, and reporting of randomized controlled trials should be improved, to establish strong evidence for the effectiveness of the various therapeutic interventions for acute and chronic low back pain.
Summary 1: A review reported that exercise, back manipulation, and intense back schools were equally efficacious.

Query 2: Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia?
Document 2: Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of exercise training as an treatment for FMS. We searched 6 electronic bibliographies for studies of exercise training in FMS: MEDLINE (1966-12/2000), CINAHL (1982-12/2000), HealthSTAR (1990-12/2000), Sports Discus (1975-05/2000), EMBASE (1974-05/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 4). We also reviewed the reference lists from identified articles including reviews and meta-analyses of treatment studies. Randomized trials focused on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength and/or flexibility as treatment for FMS were selected. Two reviewers independently identified trials meeting inclusion criteria, rated the methodologic quality using 2 standardized validated instruments, evaluated the adequacy of the exercise training stimulus using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria and evaluated the results. Disagreements were resolved through active discussion and consensus. High quality training studies had scores of 50% or greater on van Tulder methodologic criteria and met the minimum training standards of ACSM. Outcome variables were grouped into 7 constructs: pain, tender points, physical function, global well being, self efficacy, fatigue & sleep, and psychological function. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, results and point estimates for selected variables, and used consensus to address discrepancies. Sixteen trials involving a total of 724 participants were assigned at random to: exercise intervention groups (n=379), control groups (n=277), or groups receiving an alternate treatment (n=68). Seven studies were high quality training studies: 4 aerobic training, 1 a mixture of aerobic, strength and flexibility training, 1 strength training and 2 with exercise training as part of a composite treatment. Flexibility protocols were never described in sufficient detail to allow evaluation. The four high quality aerobic training studies reported significantly greater improvements in the exercise groups versus control groups in aerobic performance (17.1% increase in aerobic performance with exercise versus 0.5% increase in the control groups), tender point pain pressure threshold (28.1% increase versus 7.0% decrease) and improvements in pain (11.4% decrease in pain versus 1.6% increase). Poor description of exercise protocols was common, with insufficient information on intensity, duration, frequency and mode of exercise. Adverse events were also poorly reported. Supervised aerobic exercise training has beneficial effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms. Strength training may also have benefits on some FMS symptoms. Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed. Research on the long-term benefit of exercise for FMS is needed.
Summary 2: We examined the results of a systematic review of exercise for treating fibromyalgia. The authors found 7 high-quality studies, 4 of aerobic training, and concluded that supervised aerobic exercise training had beneficial effects on physical capacity, tender-point threshold, and pain. Other investigators have questioned the usefulness of aerobic exercise because long-term benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor.

Query: What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain?
Document: Criteria-based review. Reviews based on trials published up to 1990 conclude that the efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with low back pain is questionable. To determine from recently published trials the efficacy of exercises in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic back pain. A Medline search for randomized trials concerning exercise therapy in patients with back pain published from 1991 until the first quarter of 1995 was conducted. All studies were given a method score (maximum, 100 points). Eleven randomized trials were included: four in acute back pain, one in subacute, and six in patients with chronic back pain. Three trials had method scores lower than 40 points. For acute back pain, two trials with high method scores (> 50 points) reported no efficacy of flexion or extension exercises; two trials of the McKenzie type of exercises reported positive results but had low method scores. For subacute pain, one trial (> 50 points) reported positive results of exercises with a graded activity program. For chronic back pain, three trials reported positive results with different types of exercises; two trials reported better results with intensive exercising compared with low grade exercising, but after 12 months, this effect had disappeared. In chronic pain, no relation between method score and conclusions could be found. In acute back pain, exercise therapy is ineffective, whereas in subacute back pain, exercises with a graded activity program, and in chronic back pain, intensive exercising, deserve attention. More research on McKenzie therapy, on exercises with a graded activity program, and on different types of exercising in patients with chronic back pain is necessary.
Summary:",Performance of specific flexion or extension exercises was no more effective than analgesics.

Query 1: Is prostate-specific antigen PSA screening indicated for any subgroup of men?
Document 1: The American Cancer Society and other national medical organizations emphasize the need for routine screening for prostate cancer in men over the age of 50. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay is the test most commonly recommended for the purpose of screening. However, when PSA screening is examined critically from the standpoint of the principles of screening, evidence from prospective studies to support the routine use of PSA testing is lacking. Data suggest that screening often detects what may be indolent, nonaggressive prostate cancer. The treatment of such a cancer with radiation or radical prostatectomy can result in significant morbidity, including urinary incontinence and impotence, without a proven decrease in mortality. Evidence from randomized clinical trials in support of routine PSA screening is urgently needed.
Summary 1: Higher-risk subgroups merit special attention. Screening the 3 groups mentioned above would improve the positive predictive value of PSA, but crucial data to determine whether this will improve outcomes are lacking. Using average estimates, if 3300 African American men (aged 50 to 65 years) were screened, 100 would have cancer. After subsequent radical prostatectomy, 1 screened man would die from the procedure, 60 would become impotent, and 20 would be incontinent.

Query 2: Should we screen adults for asymptomatic microhematuria?
Document 2: Screening urine for microhematuria as an indicator of serious disease is controversial because of the low positive predictive value of such screening and the costs and risks of the associated evaluation. To further evaluate test properties, we retrospectively examined the outcomes of 20,571 men aged > or = 35 years and women aged > or = 55 years who voluntarily had a Personal Health Appraisal in 1980 as members of a large prepaid health plan. Hematuria was detected by dipstick in 876 cases (4.3%); 278 were excluded because of evidence of previous urological disease which could cause hematuria. Review of the medical records of 598 patients with asymptomatic microhematuria as shown by a positive dipstick result indicated that 99% had a follow-up evaluation within 3 months of positive test results for hematuria and had various levels of urological evaluation thereafter. However, urological cancers (2 prostate, 1 bladder) developed in only 3 patients within the next 3 years. On the basis of San Francisco-Oakland Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data, rates of urological cancer were evaluated among patients whose test results were negative for hematuria, and these cancer rates were found to be almost the same as the rate among patients with asymptomatic microhematuria. Sensitivity of a single dipstick urinalysis result using microhematuria to indicate urological cancer within 3 years was 2.9%; specificity was 96.7%; and positive predictive value was 0.5%. Multivariate analysis which adjusted for age, gender, and race showed that the relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-6.6) for urological cancer was not significantly elevated among patients with asymptomatic microhematuria compared with patients who had negative test results. These findings based on a single test are consistent with the current lack of recommendations for screening for microhematuria among asymptomatic adults.
Summary 2: Among 20,751 California health maintenance organization patients who had a periodic health appraisal, screening identified 598 patients with asymptomatic microhematuria (prevalence=2.9%). The medical records for all patients were reviewed for the year prior to screening to find pre-existing urologic disease and then reviewed for new diagnoses over the next 6 years. Three cases of urologic cancer occurred in the group of patients with asymptomatic microhematuria (incidence=0.5%) and 102 cancer cases among the 20,153 patients without asymptomatic microhematuria (incidence=0.5%). Its presence was not significantly associated with either uro-logic cancers or other serious urologic disease.

Query: Is prostate-specific antigen PSA screening indicated for any subgroup of men?
Document: The issue of whether to screen men for prostate cancer is controversial. No randomized clinical trials have been completed to confirm the efficacy of screening for prostate cancer. We created a mathematical model of the clinical risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer. A Markov decision-analytic model evaluated the outcomes of annually screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 years. The screening and testing algorithm included the digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and prostate-specific antigen test. A sample of 10 male patients with no history of prostate disease were interviewed to assess their utilities (preferences) regarding the various adverse outcomes of prostate cancer treatment. The model indicated that no screening was preferred to screening when patients' utilities were considered (24.14 vs 23.47 quality-adjusted life years expected). The optimal decision was sensitive to the utilities of impotence and urethral stricture, the most common adverse outcomes for patients under the age of 65 years. When adverse outcomes of treatment were ignored, screening was favored (24.86 vs 24.22 years of life expectancy. When quality-of-life preferences of men are considered, the annual screening of asymptomatic patients for prostate cancer is not recommended.
Summary:","A decision analysis, using quality-of-life measures, concluded that men would favor screening only if the prevalence of CaP were greater than any current estimate."

Query 1: Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media?
Document 1: Increasing concerns over drug-resistant bacteria mandate that alternative methods of treatment and prevention, including surgery, be considered to reduce antibiotic usage for acute otitis media (AOM). Meta-analysis of five randomized trials of tubes versus no surgery showed a mean absolute decrease in AOM incidence of 1.0 episode per child-year (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), with a relative decrease of 56%. Similarly, the prevalence of middle-ear effusion decreased by 115 days per child-year (95% CI, 11-220). Within several weeks of tube placement 79% of children had improved quality of life, 17% had trivial change, and 4% were worse. Systematic review of 134 articles revealed transient post-operative otorrhea in 16% of patients with tubes, and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8% Adenoidectomy reduced AOM incidence by 0.32 episodes per child-year (95% CI, 0.03-0.61) for a 3-year period in one study (26% relative decrease), but the effect was only significant for children with prior tubes. Surgical therapy of otitis media offers significant benefits and is an effective prevention strategy in selected children.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials comparing no surgery with placement of tubes for recurrent acute otitis media with or without middle-ear effusion showed that the placement of tubes resulted in a mean absolute decrease in acute otitis media incidence of 1.0 per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.6), and a decrease in the prevalence of middle-ear effusion by 115 days per year (95% CI, 11-220).

Query 2: Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media?
Document 2: To determine the efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion in preventing recurrences of acute otitis media, we randomized 264 children 7 to 35 months of age who had a history of recurrent otitis media but were free of middle ear effusion to receive either amoxicillin prophylaxis, bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion or placebo. The average rate of new episodes per child year of either acute otitis media or otorrhea was 0.60 in the amoxicillin group, 1.08 in the placebo group and 1.02 in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P less than 0.001; tubes vs. placebo, P = 0.25). The average proportion of time with otitis media of any type was 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, 15.0% in the placebo group and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P = 0.03; tubes vs. placebo, P less than 0.001). At the 2-year end point, the rate of attrition was 42.2% in the amoxicillin group, 45.5% in the placebo group and 26.7% in the tympanostomy tube group. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 7.0% of the amoxicillin group and persistent tympanic membrane perforations developed in 3.9% of the tympanostomy tube group. The observed degree of efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion must be viewed in light of the fact that study subjects proved not to have been at as high risk for acute otitis media as had been anticipated and in view of the differential attrition rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: One randomized controlled trial of 264 children, aged 7 to 35 months, with a history of recurrent acute otitis media but free of middle-ear effusion, compared tubes with medical therapy and found no difference in recurrence over 2 years. The medical therapy arm received prophylaxis with either amoxicillin or placebo. The amoxicillin arm had 0.6 fewer episodes of acute otitis media per year compared with the other 2, a statistically significant 40% decrease (relative risk reduction=0.4). The average time with otitis media of any type (acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, or ottorhea) also decreased-15.0% in the placebo group, 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P=.03; tubes vs. placebo, P<.001). Higher dropout rates occurred in the amoxicillin and medical treatment groups.

Query 1: Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma?
Document 1: According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture is a suitable treatment for complex chronic diseases such as bronchial asthma. In a randomized, controlled study we investigated immunologic effects of Chinese acupuncture on patients with allergic asthma. The effects of acupuncture treatment given according to the principles of TCM (TCM group, n = 20) were compared with those of acupuncture treatment using points not specific for asthma (control group, n = 18). All patients were treated 12 times for 30 minutes over a time period of 4 weeks. Patients' general well-being and several peripheral blood parameters (eosinophils, lymphocyte subpopulations, cytokines, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation) were determined before and after acupuncture treatment. In the TCM group, significantly more patients indicated an improvement in general well-being (79% in the TCM group versus 47% in the control group; p = 0.049) after acupuncture treatment. The following changes were found in the TCM group: within the lymphocyte subpopulations the CD3+ cells (p = 0.005) and CD4+ cells (p = 0.014) increased significantly. There were also significant changes in cytokine concentrations: interleukin (IL)-6 (p = 0.026) and IL-10 (p = 0.001) decreased whereas IL-8 (p = 0.050) rose significantly. Additionally, the in vitro lymphocyte proliferation rate increased significantly (p = 0.035) while the number of eosinophils decreased from 4.4% to 3.3% after acupuncture (p > 0.05). The control group, however, showed no significant changes apart from an increase in the CD4+ cells (p = 0.012). The results imply that asthma patients benefit from acupuncture treatment given in addition to conventional therapy. Furthermore, acupuncture performed in accordance with the principles of TCM showed significant immune-modulating effects.
Summary 1: In 1 RCT, improvement in general well-being was reported by 79% of 38 patients receiving acupuncture compared with 47% of 18 patients in the control group.

Query 2: Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma?
Document 2: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in modern society and there is increasing evidence to suggest that its incidence and severity are increasing. There is a high prevalence of usage of complementary medicine for asthma. Herbal preparations have been cited as the third most popular complementary treatment modality by British asthma sufferers. This study was undertaken to determine if there is any evidence for the clinical efficacy of herbal preparations for the treatment of asthma symptoms. Four independent literature searches were performed on Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Only randomised clinical trials were included. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The data were extracted in a standardised, predefined manner and assessed critically. Seventeen randomised clinical trials were found, six of which concerned the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and eight described traditional Indian medicine, of which five investigated Tylophora indica. Three other randomised trials tested a Japanese Kampo medicine, marihuana, and dried ivy leaf extract. Nine of the 17 trials reported a clinically relevant improvement in lung function and/or symptom scores. No definitive evidence for any of the herbal preparations emerged. Considering the popularity of herbal medicine with asthma patients, there is urgent need for stringently designed clinically relevant randomised clinical trials for herbal preparations in the treatment of asthma.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 17 trials, with overall poor methodological quality and a total of 1445 participants, reported significant improvements in clinically relevant measures with 6 different herbal medicines. Ginkgo biloba liquor increased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 10% at 4 weeks and by a more clinically relevant 15% at 8 weeks (significantly greater than placebo, P<.05). Invigorating Kidney for Preventing Asthma (IKPA) tablets increased FEV1 by 30% at 3 months compared with 17% in controls (P<.05). Wenyang Tonglulo Mixture (WTM) improved FEV1 by 30% at 8 weeks compared with a 16% increase in the control group using oral salbutamol and inhaled beclomethasone (P<.05). Dried ivy extract, thought to work as both a secretolytic and bronchospasmolytic, reduced airway resistance in children by 23.6% compared with placebo (P=.036). Tylophora indica (a rare herb also known as Indian ipecac) provided significant improvement in nocturnal dyspnea when compared with controls (P<.01) in a study that relied on patients' symptom diaries. Tsumura saiboku-to (TJ-96) provided patients in one randomized controlled trials with significant, but unspecified, asthma symptom relief when compared with those in a control group (P<.01).

Query: Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma?
Document: Acupuncture has traditionally been used to treat asthma in China and is used increasingly for this purpose internationally. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of asthma or asthma-like symptoms. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register (searched August 2003), the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field trials register, the Alternative Medicine Database (August 2003) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted trialists and researchers in the field of complementary and alternative medical research. Randomised and possibly randomised trials using needle acupuncture or other forms of stimulation of acupuncture. Any form of control treatment was considered (no treatment in addition to conventional asthma treatment, sham or placebo interventions, active comparator interventions). Studies were included provided outcome was assessed at one week or more. At least two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. A reviewer experienced in acupuncture assessed the adequacy of the active and sham acupunctures used in the studies. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria with 324 participants. Trial reporting was poor and trial quality was deemed inadequate to generalise findings. There was variation in the type of active and sham acupunctures, the outcomes measured and time-points presented. The points used in the sham arm of some studies are used for the treatment of asthma according to traditional Chinese medicine. Two studies used individualised treatment strategies and one study used a combination strategy of formula acupuncture with the addition of individualised points. No statistically significant or clinically relevant effects were found for acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture. Data from two small studies were pooled for lung function (post-treatment FEV1): Standardised Mean Difference 0.12, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 0.55). There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about the value of acupuncture in asthma treatment. Further research needs to consider the complexities and different types of acupuncture.
Summary:","While a Cochrane review of 11 RCTs with variable trial quality and a total of 324 participants found that acupuncture had no significant effect on pulmonary function or global assessment of well-being, the review noted that some studies reported significant positive changes in daily symptoms, reductions in medication use, and improved quality of life. This suggests that some patients with mild to moderate asthma may benefit from acupuncture."

Query 1: Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma?
Document 1: Previous reports have shown that ion content in the air may have an effect on respiratory function. Results from studies which test the efficacy of air ionisers to reduce asthma symptoms are often inconclusive and their use as a treatment for asthma remains debatable. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma trials register (January 1966 to March 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library issue 2, 2003) as well as The Alternative Medicine Database AMED (1985 to March 2003). Randomised controlled trials (parallel or crossover design studies) comparing ionisers with dummy ionisers (being negative or positive ion emitters), in children or adults with chronic asthma. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts of studies and assessed trial quality. Study quality was determined using two methods:The Cochrane approach to allocation concealment and the five point Jadad scale. Six studies were selected for inclusion (106 participants). No results were combined as the studies were all of a crossover design. EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE ION GENERATORS (five studies)No study reported a significant difference in lung function between ionised and control air (morning Peak expiratory flow (PEF) - three studies; forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) - one study). There were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies. EFFECTS OF POSITIVE ION GENERATORS (one study)This study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in FEV1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. Baseline FEV1 was not demonstrated to be significantly different between treatment groups. Based on the evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials, a recommendation cannot be given for the use of room air ionisers to reduce symptoms in patients with chronic asthma.
Summary 1: Cochrane review of 6 good-quality trials with a total of 106 participants reported no significant effect of room air ionizers on pulmonary function measures, symptoms, or medication use.

Document: Despite the growing number of studies of imagery and the use of complementary and alternative modalities as treatments for asthma, research on mental imagery in adults with asthma is practically, nonexistent. The purpose of this feasibility study was to lay groundwork for a larger follow-up clinical trial. To determine whether pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and power differ over time in adults with asthma who do and do not practice mental imagery (MI). (Power is the ability to make aware choices with the intention of freely involving oneself in creating desired change.) Randomized controlled study using univariate repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and replacement through block design. Lenox Hill Hospital, an affiliate of New York University Medical School, New York, NY. Sixty-eight adults with symptomatic asthma, after 4 weeks of baseline data collection and analysis, met requirements for this randomized controlled study. Thirty-three completed pulmonary function as well as self-report tests at 4 time points over 17 weeks. The 16 experimental participants also completed the 4-session imagery protocol. Individual imagery instruction (week 1) and follow-up (weeks 4, 9, 15). Participants were given 7 imagery exercises to select from and practice 3 times a day for a total of 15 minutes. 1) Spirometry (FEV1); 2) medication use; 3) Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; 4) Beck Depression Inventory; 5) Spielberger Anxiety Scales (A-State and A-Trait); 6) Barrett Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool, Version II; 7) Epstein Balloon Test of Ability to Image. There was little evidence of statistical change in this feasibility study; yet, valuable lessons were learned. Paired t-tests indicated there was a significant difference in the total power scores in the imagery group, and in the expected direction (two-tailed, t-statistic = -2.3, P = 0.035) and the choices sub-scale (two-tailed, tstatistic = -2.93, P = 0.01) of the power instrument from weeks one to 16 of the study. Eight of 17 (47%) participants in the MI group reduced or discontinued their medications. Three of 16 (19%) participants in the control group reduced their medications; none discontinued. Chi-square indicated differences between groups (X2 = 4.66, P = 0.05). Persons who reduced or discontinued their medications showed neither an increase in pulmonary function prior to medication discontinuation, nor a fall in these parameters following discontinuation. Findings related to major outcome measures must be viewed with caution due to the small sample size resulting from attrition related to labor intensiveness and, therefore, low statistical power. However, the study did provide significant data to plan a larger scale study of the use of mental imagery with adult asthmatics. The study also demonstrated that imagery is inexpensive, safe and, with training, can be used as an adjunct therapy by patients themselves. Its efficacy needs additional exploration. Further research for adults with asthma who practice imagery is important, as current treatments are not entirely efficacious. Lessons learned in this study may facilitate improvement in research designs.
Summary:","A pilot RCT with 33 adults found a nonsignificant reduction in medication use among the subjects practicing mental imagery, but no overall effect on lung function or quality-of-life measures."

Query 1: How should thyroid replacement be initiated?
Document 1: Standard therapy for patients with primary hypothyroidism is replacement with synthetic thyroxine, which undergoes peripheral conversion to triiodothyronine, the active form of thyroid hormone. Within the lay population and in some medical communities, there is a perception that adding synthetic triiodothyronine, or liothyronine, to levothyroxine improves the symptoms of hypothyroidism despite insufficient evidence to support this practice. To evaluate the benefits of treating primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy vs levothyroxine monotherapy. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from May 2000 to February 2002 at a military treatment facility that serves active duty and retired military personnel and their family members. The trial included a total of 46 patients aged 24 to 65 years with at least a 6-month history of treatment with levothyroxine for primary hypothyroidism. Patients received either their usual dose of levothyroxine (n = 23) or combination therapy (n = 23), in which their usual levothyroxine dose was reduced by 50 micro g/d and substituted with liothyronine, 7.5 micro g, taken twice daily for 4 months. Scores on a hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) questionnaire, body weight, serum lipid levels, and 13 neuropsychological tests measured before and after treatment. Serum thyrotropin levels remained similar and within the normal range in both treatment groups from baseline to 4 months. Body weight and serum lipid levels did not change. The HRQL questionnaire scores improved significantly in both the control group (23%; P<.001) and the combination therapy group (12%; P =.02), but these changes were statistically similar (P =.54). In 12 of 13 neuropsychological tests, outcomes between groups were not significantly different; the 1 remaining test (Grooved Peg Board) showed better performance in the control group. Compared with levothyroxine alone, treatment of primary hypothyroidism with combination levothyroxine plus liothyronine demonstrated no beneficial changes in body weight, serum lipid levels, hypothyroid symptoms as measured by a HRQL questionnaire, and standard measures of cognitive performance.
Summary 1: A study assessed changes in body weight, lipid profile, hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life scores, and 13 neuropsychological measures pre- and posttreatment. This study detected no difference in body weight and serum lipids at baseline and after treatment. The hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life scores similarly improved for both treatment groups. Twelve of 13 neuropsychological tests demonstrated no differences between treatment groups; the Grooved Peg Board Test of manual dexterity and fine visual-motor coordination demonstrated a slight improvement for the LT4 alone treatment group.

Query 2: How should thyroid replacement be initiated?
Document 2: Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 wk. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) dropped by 50%, and T(3) was started at a dose of 12.5 micro g, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to keep goal TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) plus T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores that included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study (P > 0.05 for all indexes). In conclusion, the current data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.
Summary 2: One study, which enrolled patients with hypothy-roidism and mild depressive symptoms, assessed scores on the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screens for Depression, and the Medical Outcomes Study health status questionnaire at baseline and multiple times over the duration of the study. For these outcomes, no differences were found between the LT4 alone and combination LT4-LT3 treatment groups within 90% confidence intervals.

Query: How should thyroid replacement be initiated?
Document: To compare relative bioavailability of Synthroid, Levoxine (Levoxine has been renamed Levoxyl), and 2 generic levothyroxine sodium preparations. Single-blind (primary investigators blinded), randomized, 4-way crossover trial. Ambulatory care. Twenty-two women with hypothyroidism who were clinically and chemically euthyroid and were receiving levothyroxine sodium, 0.1 or 0.15 mg. All patients received each of the 4 levothyroxine products for 6-week periods in the same dosage as their prestudy regimen with no washout period. The order of the drug sequences was randomly determined before study initiation. Area under the curve, time to peak serum concentrations, and peak serum concentrations of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine index for all 4 products. All data analyses were completed prior to unblinding of the product codes. No significant differences between the 4 products were found in area under the curve or peak serum concentrations of total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, or free thyroxine index. Although Synthroid produced a more rapid rise in total serum triiodothyronine concentration and a higher total peak serum triiodothyronine concentration than the other products, these differences were not statistically significant (P=.08). The Food and Drug Administration criterion for relative bioequivalence within 90% confidence intervals (0.8-1.25) was demonstrated (P<.05) for all pairs of products. Relative bioequivalence of 0.95 to 1.07 was demonstrated, tighter than the current bioequivalence criterion for oral formulations. The 4 generic and brand-name levothyroxine preparations studied are different but are bioequivalent by current Food and Drug Administration criteria and are interchangeable in the majority of patients receiving thyroxine replacement therapy. Further investigation is required to determine whether our results are equally applicable to all existing levothyroxine preparations.
Summary:","In 1997, a bioequivalence study compared 2 generic brands to 2 name brands by having 22 women with hypothyroidism, who were euthyroid on replacement medication, take each preparation for 6 weeks. The area under the curve, peak serum concentration, and time to peak concentration for 3 indexes of thyroid function (thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and free T4 index) were not significantly different and met the FDA criterion for relative bioequivalence."

Query 1: How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss?
Document 1: The beneficial effects of weight loss in the obese have been widely accepted. Still, there is a lack of controlled studies displaying large maintained weight losses over long periods (>4 years). We wanted to examine the results of long-standing intentional weight loss on the development of diabetes and hypertension in severely obese individuals over an 8-year period. In the ongoing prospective Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, 346 patients awaiting gastric surgery were matched with 346 obese control subjects on 18 variables by a computerized matching program. The controls were drawn from a registry consisting of 1508 obese potential controls examined at primary health care centers in Sweden. Of the 692 selected patients (body mass index 41.2+/-4.7 kg/m(2) [mean+/-SD]), 483 (70%) were followed for 8 years. No significant weight changes occurred in the obese control group over 8 years. Gastric surgery resulted in a maximum weight loss of -31.1+/-13.6 kg after 1 year. After 8 years, the maintained weight loss was still 20.1+/-15.7 kg (16.3+/-12.3%). Whereas this weight reduction had a dramatic effect on the 8-year incidence of diabetes (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.36), it had no effect on the 8-year incidence of hypertension (odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.67). A differentiated risk factor response was identified: a maintained weight reduction of 16% strongly counteracted the development of diabetes over 8 years but showed no long-term effect on the incidence of hypertension.
Summary 1: A study demonstrated 25% ± 6% weight loss vs 0.9% gain at 8 years.

Document 2: To examine the effect of a large, long standing and intentional weight reduction on the incidence of diabetes, hypertension and lipid disturbances in severely obese individuals as compared to weight-stable obese controls. The ongoing prospective SOS (Swedish Obese Subjects) intervention consists of a surgically treated group and a matched control group obtaining conventional obesity treatment. This report is based on 845 surgically treated patients and 845 controls (BMI 41.0+/-4.6 kg/m2 (mean+/-standard deviation [S])) followed for 2 years. Surgically treated patients lost 28+/-15 kg and controls 0.5+/-8.9 kg (p<0.0001). Two-year incidence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and lipid disturbances was compared in the two treatment groups. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for the surgically treated group versus controls were 0.38 (0.22, 0.65) for hypertension, 0.02 (0.00, 0.16) for diabetes, 0.10 (0.03, 0.28) for hyperinsulinemia, 0. 10 (0.04, 0.25) for hypertriglyceridemia, 0.28 (0.16, 0.49) for low HDL-cholesterol and 1.24 (0.84, 1.8) for hypercholesterolemia. Compared to controls, the 2-year recovery rates from hypertension, diabetes, hypo-HDL, and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly higher in the surgically treated group. Intentional weight loss in the obese causes a marked reduction in the 2-year incidence of hypertension, diabetes and some lipid disturbances. The results suggest that severe obesity can and should be treated.
Summary 2: In the Swedish Obesity Study, hypertriglyceridemia decreased postoperatively but hypercholesterolemia did not.

Query: How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss?
Document: Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several observational epidemiological studies have indicated that weight gain and weight loss, even in the obese, is also related to an increased mortality. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was initiated in 1987 as an attempt to elucidate this paradox. Two thousand matched patient pairs will be followed for 10 y each. One pair member is surgically treated, while the other receives conventional obesity treatment. By February 2000, 1879 patient pairs have been recruited. The two-y weight reduction was 28+/-15 kg among the operated patients and 0.5+/-8.9 kg among the obese controls. After eight years the weight loss was 20+/-16 kg in the surgical group, while the controls had gained 0.7+/-12 kg. Weight reductions achieved in the surgical group reduced the two-y incidence of diabetes 32 times as compared to the controls. After eight years there was still a 5-fold reduction in diabetes incidence. The two-y incidence of hypertension was similarly reduced 2.6 times in the surgical group. After eight years the incidence of hypertension was almost equal in the two study groups. Compared to weight stability, large intentional weight loss results in substantial reductions in the two-y incidence of several cardiovascular risk factors. After eight years there is still a reduced risk of developing diabetes in the surgical group, while the incidence of hypertension is equal in the two treatment groups. Whether intentional weight loss will reduce mortality is still too early to tell.
Summary:","The Swedish Obesity Study, a large cohort study with matched controls. Surgery produced 23 to 28 kg more weight loss at 2 years. The study demonstrated 33% ± 10% weight loss for gastric bypass and 0% for medical therapy (not described) at 2 years."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document 1: The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee. To synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout. MEDLINE search from 1966 to October 2002. We included all published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures. We included studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage. We included all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout. We extracted all data in duplicate and abstracted physical examination and MRI results into 2 x 2 tables. Among the 5 decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age >55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for 4 steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than is the drawer sign. For meniscal tears, joint line tenderness is sensitive (75%) but not specific (27%), while the McMurray test is specific (97%) but not sensitive (52%). Compared with the physical examination, MRI is more sensitive for ligamentous and meniscal damage but less specific. When the differential diagnosis for acute knee pain includes an exacerbation of osteoarthritis, clinical features (age >50 years, morning stiffness <30 minutes, crepitus, or bony enlargement) are 89% sensitive and 88% specific for underlying chronic arthritis. Adding plain films improves sensitivity slightly but not specificity. Plain films for pseudogout are not sensitive or specific, according to limited-quality studies. We recommend the Ottawa knee rules to decide when to obtain plain films for suspected knee fracture. A careful physical examination should be sufficient to decide whether to refer patients with potential meniscal and ligament injuries, and we prefer clinical criteria rather than plain films for evaluating osteoarthritis. We do not recommend using plain films to diagnose pseudogout.
Summary 1: Physical examination (including the Lachman test, Drawer sign, and McMurray test) by an orthopedist or sports medicine-trained physician was 74% to 88% sensitive and 72% to 95% specific for suspected meniscal or ligamentous injuries; magnetic resonance imaging added marginal value in referral decisions regarding these conditions.

Document 2: The Ottawa knee rule is a clinical decision aid that helps rule out fractures and avoid unnecessary radiography. To summarize evidence about the accuracy of the Ottawa knee rule. Relevant English- and non-English-language articles were identified from PreMEDLINE and MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), BIOSIS (1990-2003), the Cochrane Library (2002, Issue 3), the Science Citation Index database, reference lists of included studies, and experts. Articles were included if they reported enough information to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Ottawa knee rule for detecting fractures confirmed either radiologically or in combination with follow-up. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study samples, the ways that the Ottawa knee rule was used, and methodologic characteristics of studies. Of 11 identified studies, 6 involving 4249 adult patients were considered appropriate for pooled analysis. The pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23), the pooled sensitivity was 98.5% (CI, 93.2% to 100%), and the pooled specificity was 48.6% (CI, 43.4% to 51.0%). A negative result on an Ottawa knee rule test accurately excluded knee fractures after acute knee injury. However, because the rule is calibrated toward 100% sensitivity and actual fracture prevalences are usually low, large-scale, multicentered studies are still needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of routinely implementing the rule.
Summary 2: In a systematic review, the Ottawa rules had a pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.23).

Query: For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury?
Document: The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee. To synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout. MEDLINE search from 1966 to October 2002. We included all published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures. We included studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage. We included all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout. We extracted all data in duplicate and abstracted physical examination and MRI results into 2 x 2 tables. Among the 5 decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age >55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for 4 steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than is the drawer sign. For meniscal tears, joint line tenderness is sensitive (75%) but not specific (27%), while the McMurray test is specific (97%) but not sensitive (52%). Compared with the physical examination, MRI is more sensitive for ligamentous and meniscal damage but less specific. When the differential diagnosis for acute knee pain includes an exacerbation of osteoarthritis, clinical features (age >50 years, morning stiffness <30 minutes, crepitus, or bony enlargement) are 89% sensitive and 88% specific for underlying chronic arthritis.

A careful physical examination should be sufficient to decide whether to refer patients with potential meniscal and ligament injuries, and we prefer clinical criteria rather than plain films for evaluating osteoarthritis. We do not recommend using plain films to diagnose pseudogout.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 4 studies by Jackson compared the utility of the McMurray test and joint line tenderness. For detecting meniscal tears, the McMurray test had a clinically and statistically significant positive likelihood ratio of 17.33, corresponding to a posttest probability of nearly 61%. Negative likelihood ratios for the McMurray test and joint line tenderness (0.5 and 0.8) were not clinically significant, indicating that absence of the McMurray sign or joint line tenderness alone is of little benefit in ruling out meniscal injury."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury?
Document 1: To derive a highly sensitive decision rule for the selective use of radiography in acute knee injuries. Prospectively administered survey. Emergency departments of two university hospitals. Convenience sample of 1,047 adults with acute knee injuries. Attending emergency physicians assessed each patient for 23 standardized clinical findings, which were recorded on data collection forms. A total of 127 patients was examined independently by two physicians to determine interobserver agreement. The outcome measure was fracture of the knee. Any patients who did not have ED radiography underwent a structured telephone interview to determine the possibility of a missed fracture. Those variables found to be both reliable (highest kappa values) and strongly associated with a fracture (highest chi 2 values) were further analyzed by a recursive-partitioning multivariate technique. The derived decision rule included the following variables: (1) age 55 years or older, (2) tenderness at the head of the fibula, (3) isolated tenderness of the patella, (4) inability to flex to 90 degrees, and (5) inability to bear weight both immediately and in the ED (four steps). The presence of one or more of these findings would have identified the 68 fractures in the study population with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval [Cl], .95 to 1.0) and a specificity of .54 (95% Cl, .51 to .57). Application of the rule would have led to a 28.0% relative reduction in the use of radiography from 68.6% to 49.4% in the study population. A practical, highly sensitive, and reliable decision rule for the use of radiography in acute knee injuries has been derived. Clinical application should await prospective validation of the rule.
Summary 1: The Ottawa Knee Rules recommend knee x-rays for any patient meeting one of these criteria: 1) ≥55 years of age. 2) Tenderness over the head of the fibula or isolated to the patella without other bony tenderness. 3) Unable to flex the knee to 90º, or unable to bear weight (for at least 4 steps) both immediately and in the emergency department.

Query 2: For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury?
Document 2: Clinicians frequently use the results of clinical diagnostic tests to make decisions concerning patients. The intent of this paper is to review the technical aspects and measurement properties of the McMurray test and, more globally, to illustrate the impact that indiscriminate test application has on test interpretation. The literature shows that diagnostic accuracy studies, which evaluate the test described by McMurray, yield remarkably similar estimates of sensitivity (about 26%) and specificity (about 94%). These test characteristics are applied to three case scenarios to illustrate the impact that history-specific prevalence (i.e., the likelihood a patient has the condition based on the history) has on the predictive values. The results show a high false positive rate when applied to patients who, based on the history, have a low pre-physical examination likelihood for the condition of interest and a higher false negative rate when applied to patients who have a high history-specific prevalence. Readers are warned that the exhaustive examination approach effectively lowers the prevalence and results in a high false positive rate. The impact that the exhaustive approach has on increasing the false positive rate is universal to all diagnostic investigations and is not unique to the McMurray test.
Summary 2: Authors of all meta-analyses noted the lack of standardization in physical examination maneuvers (especially the McMurray test) and, in some cases, no specification of how physical examination tests were performed. Authors analyzed the utility of the aggregate and composite knee examinations without specifying what constituted such an exam.

Query: For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury?
Document: This report describes ambulatory care visits made to physician offices within the United States. Statistics are presented on selected physician, patient, and visit characteristics of ambulatory care visits. The data presented in this report were collected from the 1996 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The NAMCS is part of the ambulatory care component of the National Health Care Survey, which measures health care utilization across various types of providers. The NAMCS is a national probability sample survey of visits to office-based physicians in the United States. Sample data are weighted to produce annual estimates. During 1996, an estimated 734.5 million visits were made to physician offices in the United States, an overall rate of 2.8 visits per person. One quarter of the NAMCS visits were made to general and family physicians, which was significantly higher than the other 13 specialties. Persons 75 years and over had the highest rate of physician office visits, 6.3 visits per person. Females had a significantly higher rate of visits to physicians offices than males did overall, as did white persons compared with black persons. Of all visits made to these offices in 1996, 87 percent were covered by some form of insurance, and 8.7 percent were paid ""out-of-pocket."" There were an estimated 87.6 million injury-related visits during 1996, or 33.1 visits per 100 persons. Three-quarters of these visits were for unintentional injuries.
Summary:","In a meta-analysis of 13 studies, no physical examination test-including assessment for joint effusion, McMurray test, joint line tenderness, or the Apley compression test-yielded clinically significant positive or negative likelihood ratios for a meniscal tear. The McMurray test performed best, but at 9% to 11% pretest probability of JFP_1104_CI.final 10/18/04 11:06 AM Page 918 meniscal lesions, based on prevalence estimates among primary care/specialist populations,2 the posttest probability of a positive exam is still <30%."

Query: For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury?
Document: While most meniscal or ligamentous knee injuries heal with nonoperative treatments, a subset should be treated with arthroscopic or open surgery. To analyze the accuracy of the clinical examination for meniscal or ligamentous knee injuries. MEDLINE (1966-December 31, 2000) and HealthSTAR (1975-December 31, 2000) databases were searched for English-language articles describing the diagnostic accuracy of individual examination items for the knee and a combination of physical examination items (composite examination). Other data sources included reference lists from relevant articles. Studies selected for data extraction were those that compared the performance of the physical examination of the knee with a reference standard, such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or magnetic resonance imaging. Eighty-eight articles were identified, of which 23 (26%) met inclusion criteria. A rheumatologist and an orthopedic surgeon independently reviewed each article using a standardized rating scale that scored the assembly of the study, the relevance of the patients enrolled, the appropriateness of the reference standard, and the blinding of the examiner. Summary likelihood ratios (LRs) were estimated from random effects models. The summary LRs for physical examination for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, using the anterior drawer test, were 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-22.0) for a positive examination and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.05-1.50) for a negative examination; the Lachman test, 25.0 (95% CI, 2.7-651.0) and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.0-0.4); and the composite assessment, 25.0 (95% CI, 2.1-306.0) and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01-0.48), respectively. The LRs could not be generated for any specific examination maneuver for a posterior cruciate ligament tear, but the composite assessment had an LR of 21.0 (95% CI, 2.1-205.0) for a positive examination and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01-0.50) for a negative examination. Determination of meniscal lesions, using McMurray test, had an LR of 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9-1.7) for a positive examination and 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6-1.1) for a negative examination; joint line tenderness, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.8-1.0) and 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0-1.3); and the composite assessment, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4-5.1) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7), respectively. The composite examination for specific meniscal or ligamentous injuries of the knee performed much better than specific maneuvers, suggesting that synthesis of a group of examination maneuvers and historical items may be required for adequate diagnosis.
Summary:","In another meta-analysis including 9 studies of meniscal injury diagnosis, individual tests for joint line tenderness, joint effusion, the medial-lateral grind test, and the McMurray test failed to yield statistically significant likelihood ratios for the presence or absence of meniscal tears. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for aggregate physical examination were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.1) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7), which are statistically, but not clinically, significant values for ruling meniscal lesions in or out."

Query 1: Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee?
Document 1: To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat. Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors. Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained. In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16-24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients. Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16-24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16-24 weeks.
Summary 1: Two studies using higher-dose steroids (prednisone equivalent dose of 37.5 to 80 mg), with or without joint lavage, assessed improvement at 16 to 24 weeks. Although neither individual study showed statistically significant differences, the pooled data from the 2 studies favored symptom improvement at 16 to 24 weeks (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7; NNT=4.4).

Document 2: To assess the efficacy of a single intra-articular injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide (THA) in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and examine factors which may relate to treatment efficacy. Eighty four patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of knee OA were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either THA (20 mg in 1 ml) or placebo (0.9% normal saline, 1 ml). Follow up assessments evaluated the following outcome variables: patient opinion of overall change in the treated knee, visual analogue pain score (VAS), distance walked in one minute (WD), and Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for lower limb function (HAQ). Seventy eight percent of THA and 49% of placebo treated patients reported overall improvement at week 1 (p < 0.05). At week 6, improvement was reported in 57% and 55% of patient groups, respectively. VAS improved in both groups at week 1 (THA, p < 0.001; placebo, p < 0.05) and week 6 (both p < 0.01). Improvement in VAS was significantly greater among THA treated patients at week 1 only (p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis of THA treated patients revealed greater improvement in VAS among patients with clinical evidence of an effusion (p < 0.05), and those who had synovial fluid successfully aspirated at the time of injection (p < 0.01). WD improved in THA treated patients at week 1 (p < 0.001), and in both groups at week 6 (THA, p < 0.001; placebo, p < 0.01). Improvements in HAQ were seen in THA patients only at weeks 1 and 6 (p < 0.05). Regression analysis did not identify any additional clinical, radiographic, or synovial fluid characteristics which influenced the response. THA provided short term pain relief in knee OA. Increased benefit was associated with both clinical evidence of joint effusion and successful aspiration of synovial fluid at the time of injection.
Summary 2: A randomized, single-blinded study involving 84 patients demonstrated significant self-report-ed ""overall improvement"" for patients given intra-articular triamcinolone hexacetonide (78%) compared with placebo (49%) after 1 week (P<.05). It also confirmed reports that visual analogue score for pain and distance walked in 1 minute improves significantly for both steroid- and placebo-treated groups up to 6 weeks. Only the steroid-treated patients exhibited improved walking distance at 1 week compared with baseline (P<.001).

Query: Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee?
Document: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term intraarticular (IA) steroid injections for knee pain related to osteoarthritis (OA). In a randomized, double-blind trial, 68 patients with OA of the knee received IA injections of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg (34 patients) or saline (34 patients) into the study knee every 3 months for up to 2 years. The primary outcome variable was radiologic progression of joint space narrowing of the injected knee after 2 years. Measurements of minimum joint space width were performed by an automated computerized method on standardized fluoroscopically guided radiographs taken with the patient standing and with the knee in a semiflexed position. The clinical efficacy measure of primary interest was the pain subscale from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC). Efficacy measures of secondary interest were the total score on the WOMAC, physician's global assessment, patient's global assessment, patient's assessment of pain, range of motion (ROM) of the affected knee, and 50-foot walking time. Clinical symptoms were assessed just before each injection. At the 1-year and 2-year followup evaluations, no difference was noted between the two treatment groups with respect to loss of joint space over time. The steroid-injected knees showed a trend toward greater symptom improvement, especially at 1 year, for the WOMAC pain subscale, night pain, and ROM values (P = 0.05) compared with the saline-injected knees. Using area under the curve analyses, knee pain and stiffness were significantly improved throughout the 2-year study by repeated injections of triamcinolone acetonide, but not saline (P < 0.05). Our findings support the long-term safety of IA steroid injections for patients with symptomatic knee OA. No deleterious effects of the long-term administration of IA steroids on the anatomical structure of the knee were noted. Moreover, long-term treatment of knee OA with repeated steroid injections appears to be clinically effective for the relief of symptoms of the disease.
Summary:","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studied the long-term safety and efficacy of treatment of knee osteoarthritis with repeated steroid injections. These investigators studied 66 patients aged 40 to 80 years recruited from rheumatology clinics. One half (n=33) received injections of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg, and the other half received saline injections every 3 months for 2 years. At 1- and 2-year interval follow-ups, no statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 groups in loss of joint space and no progression of degenerative disease, as demonstrated by measurements of joint space widths by standardized fluoroscopically guided radiographs. Although the primary outcome measure of this study was to assess radiologic joint space narrowing with repeated injections, knee pain and stiffness appeared to improve after 2 years, although these results were not well quantified."

Query 2: Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand?
Document 2: This retrospective study compares two methods used to treat de Quervain's disease: splintage with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid injection. Patients were separated into three groups based on symptom severity: group I-minimal, group II-mild, and group III-moderate or severe. Three hundred and nineteen wrists in 300 patients were followed from one to six years. Fifteen of 17 patients with minimal symptoms were relieved with splintage and NSAIDs. However, only seven of 20 in Group II and two of eight in Group III treated similarly were relieved. Of the 249 patients in Group III treated with injections, 76% were completely relieved, 7% were improved, and 4% were not improved. We conclude that classification of patients' with de Quervain's disease based on their pre-treatment symptoms may assist surgeons in selecting the most efficacious treatment and in providing prognostic information to their patients.
Summary 2: A retrospective study compared steroid injection with splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Researchers stratified subjects into minimal, mild, or moderate-to-severe, based on their severity of disease and limitation on their activities of daily living. Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Of those cases treated with splinting and NSAIDs, 15 of 17 in the minimal group had resolution of symptoms, but only 4 of 20 in the mild group and 2 of 8 in the moderate-to-severe group had symptoms resolve. The injection group obtained better results, with 100% of cases in the minimal and mild groups resolving and 76% of those in the more severe group resolving completely, with an additional 7% reporting improvement.

Document: To show whether intra-articular steroid injections are effective in osteoarthritis; to determine factors that predict response; and to determine whether injection has a beneficial effect on muscle strength. Double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study in 59 patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Outcome measure-Primary outcome measure: change in visual analogue score for pain at three weeks. Predictors of response analysed using logistic regression with a 15% decrease in pain score at three weeks defining response. Intra-articular methyl prednisolone acetate produced a significant reduction in visual analogue pain score at three weeks compared to both baseline (median change -2.0 mm, interquartile range -16.25 to 4.0) and placebo (median 0.0 mm, interquartile range -9.0 to 6.25). No clinical predictors of response could be identified. Muscle strength was not significantly improved in the short term by intra-articular injection. Intra-articular corticosteroids are effective for short term relief of pain in osteoarthritis but predicting responders is not possible. There may be a place for their more widespread use.
Summary:","In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, investigators randomized 59 patients aged 51 to 89 years to receive either an intra-articular injection of 1 mL of 40 mg methylprednisolone or 1 mL of 0.9% saline. After 3 weeks, patients receiving steroid injection had a minimal change in baseline visual analogue score for pain compared with those receiving saline (median change: -2.0 mm vs 0 mm on a 100-mm scale)."

Query 1: Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes?
Document 1: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are widely used oral antihyperglycemic drugs that facilitate insulin action and increase insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. However, concerns have been raised regarding the association between TZD use and a heightened risk for congestive heart failure (CHF). This study used claims data to conduct a retrospective examination of the CHF risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to compare the association with CHF in those receiving the TZD pioglitazone and those receiving insulin. Patients with type 2 diabetes aged > or =18 years who had begun treatment with pioglitazone or insulin between January 1999 and December 2001 were identified using the PharMetrics Patient-Centric database. The sample was restricted to patients for whom there were > or =12 months of data before the index date (date of the first prescription for pioglitazone or insulin) and > or =3 months of follow-up data. Patients receiving a diagnosis of CHF before the index date were excluded. The propensity score for receiving pioglitazone was estimated using logistic regression based on available observed patient characteristics. Patients receiving insulin were matched in a 1:1 ratio with patients receiving pioglitazone based on a difference of no more than +/-0.01 in the estimated propensity score for receiving pioglitazone therapy. CHF risk was examined using the Cox proportional-hazards model. After exclusion of ineligible patients, 1668 matched pairs of patients receiving pioglitazone or insulin were identified (50.9% men, 49.1% women; mean [SE] age, 51.2 [0.2] years). The 2-year crude incidence rate of CHF was significantly lower in the pioglitazone group compared with the insulin group (primary/secondary diagnosis of CHF, 2.0% vs 4.0%, respectively; P < 0.001; inpatient hospitalization for CHF, 0.7% vs 2.5%; P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for pioglitazone versus insulin was 0.501 (95% CI, 0.331-0.758; P = 0.001) for a primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF in any setting and 0.263 (95% CI, 0.135-0.511; P < 0.001) for any occurrence of an inpatient hospitalization for CHF. In this retrospective analysis of data from patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone therapy was associated with significantly lower incidence rates of CHF and inpatient hospitalization compared with insulin therapy.
Summary 1: Another manufacturer-sponsored retrospective cohort study of pioglitazone analyzed insurance claims data to compare the incidence of congestive heart failure among 1668 adult patients taking pioglitazone (and possibly other medications, but not insulin) vs 1668 adult patients taking insulin (and possibly other medications, but not a TZD). The 2 groups were matched in terms of comorbid conditions, but statistical analysis did not take disease severity into account. The incidence of congestive heart failure was 2% of pioglitazone users compared with 4% of patients using insulin (NNH for insulin=50). In addition, CHF-related hospitalizations were 0.7% for congestive heart failure in the pioglitazone group vs 2.5% in the insulin group (NNH for insulin=55). Both of these findings are statistically significant.

Query 2: How beneficial are thiazolidinediones for diabetes mellitus?
Document 2: Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician. To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects. Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin. With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.
Summary 2: Thiazolidinediones are not generally considered for first-line therapy.

Query: Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes?
Document: To compare the incidence of heart failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes receiving thiazolidinediones (TZDs) versus other oral antihyperglycemic agents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a health insurance claims database. The study sample included patients with type 2 diabetes who received an oral antihyperglycemic agent between January 1995 and March 2001. Those with any claims for TZDs were designated ""exposed,"" and each was compared with five randomly selected unexposed patients. Those with diagnoses of heart failure or who received digoxin or a diuretic in the year before their index date were excluded. The primary measure of interest was incidence of heart failure, which was defined as a hospitalization or outpatient visit with a diagnosis of heart failure. TZD patients (n = 5441) were younger than control subjects (n = 28103) but more likely to have coronary artery disease or diabetes complications, receive ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, metformin, or insulin, and have undergone HbA(1c) tests or eye exams; they also had more comorbidities and higher costs (all P < 0.05). However, TZD use was predictive of heart failure even after controlling for these variables (hazard ratio = 1.7, P < 0.001). Adjusted incidence of heart failure at 40 months was 8.2% for TZD patients and 5.3% for control subjects. The results of this observational study suggest that TZDs may increase the risk of heart failure. Physicians should use TZDs with caution in patients with heart failure, remain vigilant for manifestations of heart failure in those receiving these drugs (especially patients with cardiovasculopathy), and consider alternate therapies for patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath.
Summary:","A retrospective cohort study of health insurance claims compared the incidence of CHF among 5441 patients with diabetes who had taken TZDs (rosiglitazone, troglitazone, or pioglitazone) vs 28,103 who had not. Patients were allowed other oral agents and insulin, and they were followed for up to 6 years. The TZD group had more patients on insulin and with pre-existing comorbidities. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, which control for censored information, the incidence of new heart failure at 40 months was 8.2% in the TZD group and 5.3% in the non-TZD group (number needed to harm [NNH]=34.5). Using a multivariate analysis that controlled for the coadministration of insulin, the hazard ratio for TZD use was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.17). The incidence of CHF was 3.24% in the troglitazone group (n=1665), 2.39% in the rosiglitazone group (n=1882), and 1.63% in the pioglitazone group (n=1347). The difference in these rates is not statistically significant. Of the 28,103 patients not on a TZD, 1.41% developed heart failure. Individual agents were not compared with placebo."

Query 1: Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes?
Document 1: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are widely used oral antihyperglycemic drugs that facilitate insulin action and increase insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. However, concerns have been raised regarding the association between TZD use and a heightened risk for congestive heart failure (CHF). This study used claims data to conduct a retrospective examination of the CHF risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to compare the association with CHF in those receiving the TZD pioglitazone and those receiving insulin.

Query 2: What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes?
Document 2: Metformin is an anti-hyperglycaemic agent used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes may present long-term complications: micro- (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease). Two meta-analyses have been published before, although only secondary outcomes were assessed. To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycaemic control, body weight, lipid levels, blood pressure, insulinaemia, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were obtained from computerised searches of multiple electronic databases and hand searches of reference lists of relevant trials identified. Date of last search: September 2003. Trials fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: Diabetes mellitus type 2, metformin versus any other oral intervention, assessment of relevant clinical outcome measures, use of random allocation. Two reviewers extracted data, using a standard data extraction form. Data were summarised under a random effects model. Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk. We calculated the risk difference (RD), and the Number Needed to Treat, when it was possible. We collected data of mean and standard deviation from changes to baseline. However many trials reported end point data. This limitation lead to the expression of the results as standardised mean differences (SMD) and an overall SMD was calculated. Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the I-squared statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity. We included for analysis 29 trials with 37 arms (5259 participants), comparing metformin (37 arms and 2007 participants) with sulphonylureas (13 and 1167), placebo (12 and 702), diet (three and 493), thiazolidinediones (three and 132), insulin (two and 439), meglitinides (two and 208), and glucosidase inhibitors (two and 111). Nine studies reported data on primary outcomes. Obese patients allocated to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.009), and for all-cause mortality (P = 0.03). Obese participants assigned to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than overweight patients on conventional treatment for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.004), diabetes-related death (P = 0.03), all-cause mortality (P = 0.01), and myocardial infarction (P = 0.02). Patients assigned to metformin monotherapy showed a significant benefit for glycaemia control, weight, dyslipidaemia, and diastolic blood pressure. Metformin presents a strong benefit for HbA1c when compared with placebo and diet; and a moderated benefit for: glycaemia control, LDL cholesterol, and BMI or weight when compared with sulphonylureas. Metformin may be the first therapeutic option in the diabetes mellitus type 2 with overweight or obesity, as it may prevent some vascular complications, and mortality. Metformin produces beneficial changes in glycaemia control, and moderated in weight, lipids, insulinaemia and diastolic blood pressure. Sulphonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, insulin, and diet fail to show more benefit for glycaemia control, body weight, or lipids, than metformin.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of head-to-head studies involving metformin showed equal efficacy compared with injected insulin (2 trials, 811 participants), Α-glucosidase inhibitors (2 trials, 223 participants), and non-sulfonylurea secretagogues (2 trials, 413 participants).

Query: Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes?
Document: Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there are few data from clinical trials comparing cardiovascular effects of alternative oral anti-diabetic agents. Major cardiovascular outcomes during four one-year, double-blind trials in over 3700 patients with type 2 diabetes randomised to either a thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, metformin or a sulphonylurea, gliclazide treatment have been combined. Mean blood pressure was slightly reduced by all treatments, with pioglitazone treatment resulting in the largest falls (approximately 1.5 mmHg). Hospitalisations for cardiac or cerebrovascular events were similar with the different treatments. Overall mortality was seven of 1857 for pioglitazone and 10 of 1856 for non-pioglitazone treatments, of which three and six were cardiac deaths, respectively. The incidence of congestive cardiac failure was similar with pioglitazone (12/1857) and non-pioglitazone (10/1856) treatments. The results show similar cardiovascular outcome for the three different treatments over a one-year period, but demonstrate interesting differences, which will require longer-term formal outcome studies to determine their significance.
Summary:","A manufacturer-sponsored study that combined data from 4 separate unpublished randomized controlled trials compared the incidence of CHF at 1 year for patients treated with pioglitazone (as monotherapy and in combination with other oral agents) with those treated only with other oral agents. Cardiac failure was noted in 12 of 1857 in the pioglitazone group vs 10 of 1856 subjects in the non-pioglitazone groups (not statistically significant). The paper did not comment on how the patients were recruited, how outcomes were measured, or why the 4 original studies were not published."

Query 1: What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering?
Document 1: Nonorganic physical signs in low-back pain are described and standardized in 350 North American and British patients. These nonorganic signs are distinguishable from the standard clinical signs of physical pathology and correlate with other psychological data. By helping to separate the physical from the nonorganic they clarify the assessment of purely physical pathologic conditions. It is suggested also that the nonorganic signs can be used as a simple clinical screen to help identify patients who require more detailed psychological assessment.
Summary 1: Several exam tests are commonly thought to detect nonorganic causes of low back pain. Gordon Waddell described 8 signs in 5 categories used to ""identify [back pain] patients who require more detailed psychological assessment."".

Query 2: What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear?
Document 2: Rotator cuff tears account for almost 50% of major shoulder injuries but are sometimes difficult to diagnose. To aid diagnosis, we did a prospective study, comparing results of 23 clinical tests from 400 patients with and without rotator cuff tears. Three simple tests were predictive for rotator cuff tear: supraspinatus weakness, weakness in external rotation, and impingement. When all three were positive, or if two tests were positive and the patient was aged 60 or older, the individual had a 98% chance of having a rotator cuff tear; combined absence of these features excluded this diagnosis.
Summary 2: A prospective study of 400 patients comparing 23 different clinical exams found that 3 simple clinical tests-supraspinatus weakness, weakness in external rotation, and the presence of impingement-were highly predictive of rotator cuff tear. When all 3 tests were positive, or when 2 tests were positive for a patient aged >60 years, there was a 98% chance of the patient having a rotator cuff tear.

Query: What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering?
Document: To test a new neurological sign, the ""abductor sign,"" which can distinguish between organic and non-organic leg paresis using synergic movements of the bilateral hip abductors. The subjects were 33 patients presenting with paresis of one leg, 17 of organic origin and 16 of non-organic origin (hysteria). To test the abductor sign, the examiner told the patient to abduct each leg, and opposed this movement with his hands placed on the lateral surfaces of the patient's legs. The leg contralateral to the abducted one showed opposite actions for organic paresis and non-organic paresis: for example, when the paretic leg was abducted, the sound leg stayed fixed in organic paresis, but moved in the hyperadducting direction in non-organic paresis. Hoover's sign was used for comparison in the same patients. The abductor sign gave the correct classification for all 33 cases. Hoover's sign was reliable if the results were carefully interpreted, but it was non-diagnostic for 16 patients because of strong hip extensors and in two because of strong hip flexors. Two patients with non-organic paresis succeeded in tricking the examiner by pretending full effort to lift the paretic leg. The abductor sign is a useful test to detect non-organic paresis, because (1) it is difficult for a hysterical patient to deceive the examiner, (2) the hip abductor is one of the most commonly involved muscles in pyramidal weakness, and (3) the results are easily visible as movement or non-movement of the unabducted leg.
Summary:","In a diagnostic case-control study, the single author tested 33 patients from his practice, 17 with organic paresis, and 16 with nonorganic paresis. The author differentiated organic from nonorganic paresis by history, physical exam, and various imaging studies with no independent assessment. He reported his test as 100% accurate. We did not find any published studies of the Arm Drop test, where feigned paralysis of an upper extremity is tested by holding the arm over the face of the supine patient and letting go."

Query 1: For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy?
Document 1: To determine whether tight control of blood pressure prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial comparing tight control of blood pressure aiming at a blood pressure of <150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a beta blocker atenolol as main treatment) with less tight control aiming at a blood pressure of <180/105 mm Hg. 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median follow up of 8.4 years. Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinal photography. Mean blood pressure during follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013), and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99% confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%) (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. Tight blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration in visual acuity.
Summary 1: In the UKPDS-Hypertension in Diabetes study (a multicenter randomized study in patients with type 2 diabetes that evaluated the effects of different levels of blood pressure control on diabetic complications), researchers found that patients assigned to the tight-control group (blood pressure goal <150/85 mm Hg) had 37% risk reduction in microvascular endpoints (nephropathy and advanced retinopathy). There was no difference in study endpoints between the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril and the beta-blocker atenolol.

Query 2: For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy?
Document 2: Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. 3577 people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome in a substudy. The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.
Summary 2: In hypertensive and normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been well studied and found to reduce the risk of mortality, major cardiovascular events, and slow the progression to overt nephropathy, in patients with diabetes and at least 1 other risk factor.

Query: For those intolerant to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy?
Document: Diabetic patients are considered less suitable than nondiabetic patients for beta-blocker therapy because of the risk for worsened glucose and lipid metabolism and more severe hypoglycemic attacks. To compare the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of carvedilol with those of atenolol in diabetic patients with hypertension. Randomized, double-blind, 24-week trial. University hospital clinic. 45 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. After a 4- to 6-week run-in period during which placebo was given in a single-blind manner, patients were randomly assigned to carvedilol or atenolol. An oral glucose tolerance test; assessment of insulin sensitivity and hormonal responses to insulin hypoglycemia; and assessment of lipid levels, blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and lipid peroxidation. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass index were similar with carvedilol and atenolol (P > 0.2). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels decreased with carvedilol and increased with atenolol. Responses to carvedilol were greater than those to atenolol, as follows: increase in total glucose disposal, 9.54 mumol/kg of body weight per minute (95% CI, 7 to 11.9 mumol/kg per minute); decrease in plasma glucose response to oral glucose, 61 mmol/L x 180 minutes (CI, -101 to -21 mmol/L x 180 minutes); decrease in insulin response to oral glucose, 6.2 nmol/L x 180 minutes (CI, -9.8 to -2.6 nmol/L x 180 minutes); decrease in triglyceride level, 0.56 mmol/L (CI, -0.75 to -0.37 mmol/L; P < 0.001); increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 0.13 mmol/L (CI, 0.09 to 0.17 mmol/L; P < 0.001); and decrease in lipid peroxidation, 0.25 mumol/L (CI, -0.34 to -0.16 mumol/L). By improving glucose and lipid metabolism and reducing lipid peroxidation, carvedilol may offer advantages in patients with diabetes and hypertension.
Summary:","Selective beta-blockers like carvedilol appear to have fewer adverse metabolic effects, although the clinical significance of this difference is unclear. In insulin-dependent patients and patients with hypoglycemic episodes, peripheral vascular disease, and bronchospastic disease, beta-blockers should be used with caution."

Query 1: Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening?
Document 1: Each year, approximately 5000 infants are born in the United States with moderate-to-profound, bilateral permanent hearing loss (PHL). Universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been proposed as a means to speed diagnosis and treatment and thereby improve language outcomes in these children. To identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the evidence supporting UNHS and to compare the additional benefits and harms of UNHS with those of selective screening of high-risk newborns. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases for relevant articles published from 1994 to August 2001, using terms for hearing disorders, infants or newborns, screening, and relevant treatments. We contacted experts and reviewed reference lists to identify additional articles, including those published before 1994. We included controlled and observational studies of (1) the accuracy, yield, and harms of screening using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), or both in the general newborn population and (2) the effects of screening or early identification and treatment on language outcomes. Of an original 340 articles identified, 19 articles, including 1 controlled trial, met these inclusion criteria. Data on population, test performance, outcomes, and methodological quality were extracted by 2 authors (D.C.T., H.M.) using prespecified criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. We queried authors when information needed to assess study quality was missing. Good-quality studies show that from 2041 to 2794 low-risk and 86 to 208 high-risk newborns were screened to find 1 case of moderate-to-profound PHL. The best estimate of positive predictive value was 6.7%. Six percent to 15% of infants who are missed by the screening tests are subsequently diagnosed with bilateral PHL. In a trial of UNHS vs clinical screening at age 8 months, UNHS increased the proportion of infants with moderate-to-severe hearing loss diagnosed by age 10 months (57% vs 14%) but did not reduce the rate of diagnosis after age 18 months. No good-quality controlled study has compared UNHS with selective screening of high-risk newborns. In fair- to poor-quality cohort studies, intervention before age 6 months was associated with improved language and communication skills by ages 2 to 5 years. These studies had unclear criteria for selecting subjects, and none compared an inception cohort of low-risk newborns identified by screening with those identified in usual care, making it impossible to exclude selection bias as an explanation for the results. In a mathematical model based on the literature review, we estimated that extending screening to low-risk infants would detect 1 additional case before age 10 months for every 1441 low-risk infants screened, and result in treatment before 10 months of 1 additional case for every 2401 low-risk infants screened. With UNHS, 254 newborns would be referred for audiological evaluation because of false-positive second-stage screening test results vs 48 for selective screening. Modern screening tests for hearing impairment can improve identification of newborns with PHL, but the efficacy of UNHS to improve long-term language outcomes remains uncertain.
Summary 1: A systematic review gathered studies comparing universal hearing screening with selective screening. Most included studies used a 2-stage universal screening protocol. Infants who failed initial testing were retested within 12 weeks. Testing methods included otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). Infants who failed the second test were referred for audiological evaluation. Using these data, a hypothetical model was created, which found that 1441 newborns would need to be screened to diagnose 1 additional case of moderate-to-profound permanent hearing loss before 10 months of age (at cost of 200 extra referrals for false-positives). Sensitivity and specificity of the hypothetical model's 2-stage screening was 85% and 97%, respectively. The estimated positive predictive value was 6.7%.

Query 2: Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening?
Document 2: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) as tools for identification of neonatal hearing impairment. A total of 4911 infants including 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units, 353 well babies with one or more risk factors for hearing loss (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 1994) and 80 well babies without risk factor who did not pass one or more neonatal test were targeted as the potential subject pool on which test performance would be assessed. During the neonatal period, they were evaluated using TEOAEs in response to an 80 dB pSPL click, DPOAE responses to two stimulus conditions (L1 = L2 = 75 dB SPL and L1 = 65 dB SPL L2 = 50 dB SPL), and ABR elicited by a 30 dB nHL click. In an effort to describe test performance, these ""at-risk"" infants were asked to return for behavioral audiologic assessments, using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) at 8 to 12 mo corrected age, regardless of neonatal test results. Sixty-four percent of these subjects returned and reliable VRA data were obtained on 95.6% of these returnees. This approach is in contrast to previous studies in which, by necessity, efforts were made to follow only those infants who ""failed"" the neonatal screening tests. The accuracy of the neonatal measures in predicting hearing status at 8 to 12 mo corrected age was determined. Only those infants who provided reliable, monaural VRA test results were included in the analysis. Separate analyses were performed without regard to intercurrent events (i.e., events between the neonatal and VRA tests that could cause their results to disagree), and then after accounting for the possible influence of intercurrent events such as otitis media and late-onset or progressive hearing loss. Low refer rates were achieved for the stopping criteria used in the present study, especially when a protocol similar to the one recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference Report was followed. These analyses, however, do not completely describe test performance because they did not compare neonatal screening test results with a gold standard test of hearing. Test performance, as measured by the area under a relative operating characteristic curve, were similar for all three neonatal tests when neonatal test results were compared with VRA data obtained at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. However, ABRs were more successful at determining auditory status at 1 kHz, compared with the otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests. Performance was more similar across all three tests when they were used to identify hearing loss at 2 and 4 kHz. No test performed perfectly. Using either the two- or three-frequency pure-tone average (PTA), with a fixed false alarm rate of 20%, hit rates for the neonatal tests, in general, exceeded 80% when hearing impairment was defined as behavioral thresholds > or =30 dB HL. All three tests performed similarly when a two-frequency (2 and 4 kHz) PTA was used as the gold standard; OAE test performance decreased when a three-frequency PTA (adding 1 kHz) was used as the gold standard definition. For both PTA and all three neonatal screening measures, however, hit rate increased as the magnitude of hearing loss increased. Singly, all three neonatal hearing screening tests resulted in low refer rates, especially if referrals for follow-up were made only for the cases in which stopping criteria were not met in both ears. Following a protocol similar to that recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference report resulted in refer rates that were less than 4%. TEOAEs at 80 dB pSPL, DPOAE at L1 = 65, L2 = 50 dB SPL and ABR at 30 dB nHL measured during the neonatal period, and as implemented in the current study, performed similarly at predicting behavioral hearing status at 8 to 12
Summary 2: Individually, OAE and ABR accurately diagnose neonatal hearing loss. One multicenter cohort of 2995 infants measured test performance of OAE and ABR against the gold standard (visual reinforcement audiometry performed at 8-12 months). The authors used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to plot speech awareness thresholds for both tests. When middle-ear pathology and progressive hearing loss were excluded, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for ABR and OAE were 0.91 and 0.94, respectively, indication that both tests had excellent test accuracy (a perfect test would have an area under the curve of 1.0).

Query: Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening?
Document: The principal factors that decide how deafness affects a child's development are the degree of hearing impairment and the age at which it is diagnosed. A number of factors are thought to increase the risk of hearing impairment: low birth weight, prematurity, perinatal hypoxia and jaundice, among others. The high incidence of deafness in children without risk factors and the introduction of simple new screening tests of high sensitivity and specificity has led many prestigious bodies to recommend universal early detection programmes for deafness rather than screening targeted only at high-risk groups. To compare the long-term effectiveness of a universal neonatal screening and early treatment programme for hearing impairment with: a) screening and treatment only of high-risk neonates and b) opportunistic screening and treatment. Databases searched were MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1974 to 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004) and registers of health technology assessment agencies as well as registers of clinical guidelines. Randomised controlled trials comparing universal neonatal screening with either high-risk screening or opportunistic screening for hearing impairment. Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify suitable trials. No studies were identified which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The long-term effectiveness of universal newborn hearing screening programmes has not been established to date. There is a need for controlled trials and before and after studies to address this issue further.
Summary:",The Cochrane Collaboration published a systematic review in which no studies were found that fulfilled the inclusion criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of universal hearing screening.

Query 1: What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing?
Document 1: Both attenuated heart rate recovery following exercise and the Duke treadmill exercise score have been demonstrated to be independent predictors of mortality, but their prognostic value relative to each other has not been studied. To assess the associations among abnormal heart rate recovery, treadmill exercise score, and death in patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography. Prospective cohort study conducted in an academic medical center between September 1990 and December 1997, with a median follow-up of 5.2 years. A total of 9454 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 53 [11] years; 78% male) who underwent symptom-limited exercise electrocardiographic testing. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 30 years, history of heart failure or valvular disease, pacemaker implantation, and uninterpretable electrocardiograms. All-cause mortality, as predicted by abnormal heart rate recovery, defined as failure of heart rate to decrease by more than 12/min during the first minute after peak exercise, and by treadmill exercise score, defined as (exercise time) - (5 x maximum ST-segment deviation) - (4 x treadmill angina index). Three hundred twelve deaths occurred in the cohort. Abnormal heart rate recovery and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score were present in 20% (n = 1852) and 21% (n = 1996) of patients, respectively. In univariate analyses, death was predicted by both abnormal heart rate recovery (8% vs 2% in patients with normal heart rate recovery; hazard ratio [HR], 4.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.33-5.19; chi(2) = 158; P<.001) and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (8% vs 2% in patients with low-risk scores; HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.43-5.35; chi(2) = 164; P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, and other potential confounders, abnormal heart rate recovery remained predictive of death (among the 8549 patients not taking beta-blockers, adjusted HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.63-2.78; P<.001), as did intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (adjusted HR, 1. 49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92; P =.002). There was no interaction between these 2 predictors. In this cohort of patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography, both abnormal heart rate recovery and treadmill exercise score were independent predictors of mortality. Heart rate recovery appears to provide additional prognostic information to the established treadmill exercise score and should be considered for routine incorporation into exercise test interpretation. JAMA. 2000;284:1392-1398.
Summary 1: A prospective cohort study confirmed that a low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with high 5-year survival. Those with an intermediate- or high-risk duke treadmill exercise score had corresponding survival rates of 90% and 65%, respectively. The duke treadmill exercise score was further analyzed in a 5-year follow-up of 9454 patients, 88% of whom were low-risk (75% undergoing screening EST). Most patients (1406 of 1477) with ST-segment depression ≥1 mm had asymptomatic ischemia, only 71 having EST-induced angina. A low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with 98% survival, compared with 92% for patients with an intermediate- or high-risk DTS.

Query 2: What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing?
Document 2: Exercise testing is useful in the assessment of symptomatic patients for diagnosis of significant or extensive coronary disease and to predict their future risk of cardiac events. The Duke treadmill score (DTS) is a composite index that was designed to provide survival estimates based on results from the exercise test, including ST-segment depression, chest pain, and exercise duration. However, its usefulness for providing diagnostic estimates has yet to be determined. A logistic regression model was used to predict significant (>/=75% stenosis) and severe (3-vessel or left main) coronary artery disease, and a Cox regression analysis was used to predict cardiac survival. After adjustment for baseline clinical risk, the DTS was effectively diagnostic for significant (P<0.0001) and severe (P<0.0001) coronary artery disease. For low-risk patients (score >/=+5), 60% had no coronary stenosis >/=75% and 16% had single-vessel >/=75% stenosis. By comparison, 74% of high-risk patients (score <-11) had 3-vessel or left main coronary disease. Five-year mortality was 3%, 10%, and 35% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk DTS groups (P<0.0001). The composite DTS provides accurate diagnostic and prognostic information for the evaluation of symptomatic patients evaluated for clinically suspected ischemic heart disease.
Summary 2: A prospective cohort study confirmed that a low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with high 5-year survival-eg, 97% among 2758 patients (median age 49, 70% male, 30% prior myocardial infarction, 49% with angina).

Query: What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing?
Document: Ample evidence now exists supporting the use of the exercise test primarily for prognostic, as opposed to diagnostic, purposes. Although limitations must be recognized, the Duke exercise treadmill score, the chronotropic response to exercise, and heart rate recovery appear to function as powerful and independent predictors of risk. With the possible exception of exercise-induced ischemia, as manifested by the ST-segment and angina components of the Duke exercise treadmill score, exercise predictors of risk are not clearly modifiable. Nonetheless, they are clinically quite useful since they may well identify patients who are or are not likely to gain benefit from further testing and aggressive therapies. How so? The ""plain old"" exercise treadmill test makes it possible to easily, safely, and inexpensively identify a large group of patients who are at low risk for death or major cardiac events. For this reason alone, the predictive instruments described in this article should be routinely incorporated into clinical practice. It makes no sense to perform expensive and potentially risky diagnostic tests, prescribe polypharmacy, or institute invasive therapeutic procedures in patients who are already at low risk. As an example, Weiner and colleagues found that coronary bypass grafting only benefited CASS registry patients who had a high-risk exercise test result. Future research will be needed to further refine risk stratification with the exercise test, and determine how best to use adjunctive imaging studies and to reduce risk among patients with prognostically important findings.
Summary:",Post-EST heart rate recovery and the Chronotropic Index are enhancements to the DTS.

Document: The treadmill exercise test identifies patients with different degrees of risk of death from cardiovascular events. We devised a prognostic score, based on the results of treadmill exercise testing, that accurately predicts outcome among inpatients referred for cardiac catheterization. This study was designed to determine whether this score could also accurately predict prognosis in unselected outpatients. We prospectively studied 613 consecutive outpatients with suspected coronary disease who were referred for exercise testing between 1983 and 1985. Follow-up was 98 percent complete at four years. The treadmill score was calculated as follows: duration of exercise in minutes--(5 x the maximal ST-segment deviation during or after exercise, in millimeters)--(4 x the treadmill angina index). The numerical treadmill angina index was 0 for no angina, 1 for nonlimiting angina, and 2 for exercise-limiting angina. Treadmill scores ranged from -25 (indicating the highest risk) to +15 (indicating the lowest risk). Predicted outcomes for the outpatients, based on their treadmill scores, agreed closely with the observed outcomes. The score accurately separated patients who subsequently died from those who lived for four years (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve = 0.849). The treadmill score was a better discriminator than the clinical data and was even more useful for outpatients than it had been for inpatients. Approximately two thirds of the outpatients had treadmill scores indicating low risk (greater than or equal to +5), reflecting longer exercise times and little or no ST-segment deviation, and their four-year survival rate was 99 percent (average annual mortality rate, 0.25 percent). Four percent of the outpatients had scores indicating high risk (less than -10), reflecting shorter exercise times and more severe ST-segment deviation; their four-year survival rate was 79 percent (average annual mortality rate, 5 percent). The treadmill score is a useful and valid tool that can help clinicians determine prognosis and decide whether to refer outpatients with suspected coronary disease for cardiac catheterization. In this study, it was a better predictor of outcome than the clinical assessment.
Summary:","A prospective cohort study of 613 patients with suspected coronary artery disease investigated EST duration, presence of angina, and ST-segment depression as predictors of mortality. Patients with asymptomatic ischemia (2 mm of ischemic depression) whose EST lasted 15 minutes (DTS=+5, low risk) had a 5-year cardiac mortality of less than 1%, compared with 2% for those whose EST was tolerated for only 7 minutes (DTS=-3, intermediate risk)."

Query 1: Do testosterone injections increase libido for elderly hypogonadal patients?
Document 1: Sexual desire was studied in 22 post-menopausal women (absence of menses for at least 12 mth) without complaints of sexual dysfunction, not receiving estrogen replacement therapy, and in good physical health. Psychosexual evaluation, medical history, physical and pelvic examinations, and blood samples for the determination of estradiol, androstenedione, FSH and LH were obtained. In addition, the effects of a formal exercise program on sexual desire was investigated. It was found that approximately 50% of the women in this study experienced no decline in sexual interests with menopause, and less than 20% reported a significant decrease. Results indicated a positive relationship between desire and a measure of marital adjustments which women with loss of sex desire had on the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test. There was no correlation between gonadotropins and loss of sexual desire.
Summary 1: Up to 50% of postmenopausal women experience sexual dysfunction.

Document 2: While recent pharmacological advances have generated increased public interest and demand for clinical services regarding erectile dysfunction, epidemiologic data on sexual dysfunction are relatively scant for both women and men. To assess the prevalence and risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across various social groups and examine the determinants and health consequences of these disorders. Analysis of data from the National Health and Social Life Survey, a probability sample study of sexual behavior in a demographically representative, 1992 cohort of US adults. A national probability sample of 1749 women and 1410 men aged 18 to 59 years at the time of the survey. Risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well as negative concomitant outcomes. Sexual dysfunction is more prevalent for women (43%) than men (31%) and is associated with various demographic characteristics, including age and educational attainment. Women of different racial groups demonstrate different patterns of sexual dysfunction. Differences among men are not as marked but generally consistent with women. Experience of sexual dysfunction is more likely among women and men with poor physical and emotional health. Moreover, sexual dysfunction is highly associated with negative experiences in sexual relationships and overall well-being. The results indicate that sexual dysfunction is an important public health concern, and emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of these problems.
Summary 2: Sexual dysfunction includes desire, arousal, orgasmic, and sex pain disorders. In the US, 43% of women and 31% of men experience sexual dysfunction. Since sexual dysfunction increases with age, the prevalence will likely increase with the aging American population.

Document: From an initial group of 39, 16 cycling peri-menopausal women completed a longitudinal study in which they recorded menstrual and sexual behavior daily and were interviewed at roughly 4-mth intervals until 1 yr or more without cycling. At each interview women gave 20-ml blood samples, completed sexuality questionnaires, and rated themselves for menopausal symptoms. As predicted, the difference in weekly rate of sexual intercourse before and after the cycle showed a significant decline (P less than 0.05). For each subject, mean weekly rates of sexual intercourse for 13-wk periods over the entire transition period were plotted and the slope of the line was calculated. Overall, the mean slope was negative, as predicted, and was significantly different from zero (P less than 0.05). The questionnaire data showed that compared with their pre-menopause data, the women had fewer sexual thoughts or fantasies (P less than 0.01), suffered more from lack of vaginal lubrication during sex (P less than 0.01), and were less satisfied with their partners as lovers (P less than 0.05) after menopause. While estradiol (E) and testosterone (T) levels showed significant declines (P less than 0.02), testosterone showed the most consistent association with coital frequency. The findings generally supported our initial hypothesis of a decline in sexual interest and coital frequency after menopause.
Summary:",Low testosterone level is correlated with a decreased coital frequency.

Query 1: How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders?
Document 1: A new commercial method for measurement of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO DYNOtest, Henning, Berlin) was evaluated in normal subjects and in patients with autoimmune thyroid and non-thyroid diseases, and compared to an immune fluorescence method for measurement of anti-microsomal antibodies (MicAb), and a radioimmunological method for quantifying thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). The majority of normal subjects had anti-TPO levels below 52 U/ml and patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis had levels above 200 U/ml, with a good correlation to MicAb. In other autoimmune thyroid diseases the correlation was less pronounced. In non-thyroid autoimmune diseases MicAb showed falsely positive reactions in the presence of other autoantibodies, e.g. mitochondrial antibodies. The present study indicates that the anti-TPO method should probably replace measurements of MicAb for routine clinical use, thus providing a sensitive, precise, antigen specific method with the ability to reveal quantitative fluctuations. The study also indicates that TgAb could be abolished in routine diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases and be reserved for special clinical situations, research purposes as well as measurement in sera before evaluation of serum thyroglobulin levels.
Summary 1: One study of 235 people in a university endocrinology department found that a TPOAb level >190 U/mL yielded an LR+ of 10.75 and an LR- of 0.15 for chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis [CAHT]; the AMA-positive sera yielded an LR+ of 13.67 and an LR- of 0.19. Both TPOAb and AMA test characteristics were highly associated with CAHT (P<.001).

Query 2: How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders?
Document 2: An original radioimmunoassay for quantitation of circulating autoantibodies (aAb) to thyroperoxidase (TPO) proved to be well suited for large scale routine testing. The present study was aimed to assess the prevalence of aAb to TPO in patients with various thyroid and autoimmune disease and, for comparison, in women referred for reproductive disorders and indication of in vitro fertilization. Anti-TPO aAb were measured in sera from 32 healthy subjects and 262 patients thoroughly investigated for thyroid dysfunction. As determined in healthy subjects, the normal level of aAb to TPO in serum ranged from 0.30 to 3.07 mg/l (of affinity-purified) anti-TPO aAb. Anti-TPO and anti-MIC aAb levels were both normal in 115 patients and correlated well (r = 0.835, P less than 0.001) in the remaining 147 patients. Coexistence of normal level of anti-TPO aAb and abnormal level of anti-MIC aAb was found in 4 patients and ascribed to a lack of specificity or sensitivity of the test for anti-MIC aAb. Coexistence of abnormal level of anti-TPO aAb and normal level of anti-MIC aAb was found in 67 patients of whom 62 presented only slightly elevated (3.1 to 10.0 mg/l) anti-TPO aAb concentration; the 5 remaining patients, all with overt thyroid autoimmune disease, showed anti-TPO levels between 10.7 to 100.7 mg/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: In a study comparing AMA to TPOAb, the thyroid antibody test results of 32 healthy patients were compared with those of 262 clinic patients. In those with known thyroid dysfunction, TPOAb was found to be a more sensitive assay than AMA for autoimmune thyroid disorders. The sensitivity of TPOAb levels >3.1 U/mL was 88.1%; AMA sensitivity was 70.2% (P<.001).

Query: How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders?
Document: Stimulating thyrotrophin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) have been identified as the antibodies responsible for the pathogenesis of Graves' disease (GD) while blocking TRAbs have been implicated as the cause of hypothyroidism in some patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT). TRAb positivity in patients with other thyroid disorders such as silent thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goitre and subacute thyroiditis has been reported but the role of TRAb in these disorders is unclear. A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of TRAb positivity in Singaporean patients with a spectrum of thyroid diseases. TRAb levels were measured in 181 patients with GD, 54 patients with CLT (37 goitrous and 17 agoitrous), 16 patients with thyroid nodules, 11 patients with subacute thyroiditis, 1 patient with hyperthyroidism due to a human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)-secreting tumour, 2 patients with thyroid stimulating hormone-secreting tumours and 2 patients with amiodarone-induced dysthyroidism. Using a cut-off of 10.0 U/L, TRAb levels were found to be positive in 79.0% of GD patients, 9.2% of CLT patients (euthyroid and hypothyroid) and no patients with other thyroid disorders. TRAb was a more sensitive marker of GD than anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (53.2%) but not anti-microsomal (78.3%) antibodies. TRAb levels > 10.0 U/L appear to be highly specific for autoimmune thyroid disease.
Summary:","A cross-sectional study of 267 Singaporean patients with previously diagnosed thyroid disorders measured TRAb, AMA, and thyroglobulin. TRAb levels >10 U/L were found to have a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 13 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.2 for Graves' disease."

Query 1: Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism?
Document 1: These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.
Summary 1: Once thyroid-stimulating hormone is in the normal range, experts recommend assessing the level after 6 months and then annually.

Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.
Summary 2: In primary hypothyroidism, reassess thyroid-stimulating hormone 6 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in replacement dose. This recommendation is based on the fact that levothyroxine has a half-life of about a week; a steady state would be achieved over the course of 5 half-lives. No direct patient-oriented evidence exists for this testing interval. Test free T4 if you suspect excessive replacement or noncompliance.

Query: Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism?
Document: As there are few data on the evaluation of the adequacy of levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with central hypothyroidism (CH), a prospective study was performed to assess the accuracy of various parameters in the follow-up of 37 CH patients. Total and free thyroid hormones, TSH, and a series of clinical and biochemical indexes of peripheral thyroid hormone action have been evaluated off and on L-T4 therapy. Samples were taken before the daily administration of L-T4. In all patients off therapy, clinical hypothyroidism and low levels of free T4 (FT4) were observed, whereas values of FT3, total T4, and total T3 were below the normal range in 73%, 57%, and 19% of cases, respectively. Most of the indexes of thyroid hormone action were significantly modified after L-T4 withdrawal and exhibited significant correlation with free thyroid hormone levels. During L-T4 replacement therapy, 32 patients had circulating levels of FT4 and FT3 and indexes within the normal range with a mean L-T4 daily dose of 1.5 +/- 0.3 microg/kg BW. Despite normal serum FT4, 3 patients had borderline high values of FT3 and a clear elevation of serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations, suggesting overtreatment. Low or borderline low FT4/FT3 levels indicated undertreatment in 2 patients. The clinical parameters lack the required specificity for the diagnosis or follow-up of CH patients. The L-T4 daily dose should be established, taking into account the weight, the age, and the presence of other hormone deficiencies or pharmacological treatment of CH patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that the diagnosis of CH is reached at best by measuring TSH and FT4 concentrations. In the evaluation of the adequacy of L-T4 replacement therapy, both FT4 and FT3 serum levels together with some biochemical indexes of thyroid hormone action are all necessary to a more accurate disclosure of over- or undertreated patients.
Summary:","TSH can't be used to monitor therapy for central hypothyroidism. Follow both free T4 and T3 concentrations because elevated T3 levels, indicative of overtreatment, can occur even when free T4 measurements are normal in these patients."

Query 1: Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain?
Document 1: Three previous reviews have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of antidepressants for patients with back pain. To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain. There is conflicting evidence whether antidepressants improve functional status of patients with chronic low back pain.
Summary 1: It appears that those with only SSRI activity are not effective improving chronic pain.

Query 2: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document 2: Episodes of depression are the most frequent cause of disability among patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness and safety of standard antidepressant agents for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) have not been well studied. Our study was designed to determine whether adjunctive antidepressant therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression without increasing the risk of mania. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned subjects with bipolar depression to receive up to 26 weeks of treatment with a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy or a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo, under conditions generalizable to routine clinical care. A standardized clinical monitoring form adapted from the mood-disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, was used at all follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criterion for a durable recovery (8 consecutive weeks of euthymia). Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of treatment-emergent affective switch (a switch to mania or hypomania early in the course of treatment) were also examined. Forty-two of the 179 subjects (23.5%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy had a durable recovery, as did 51 of the 187 subjects (27.3%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo (P=0.40). Modest nonsignificant trends favoring the group receiving a mood stabilizer plus placebo were observed across the secondary outcomes. Rates of treatment-emergent affective switch were similar in the two groups. The use of adjunctive, standard antidepressant medication, as compared with the use of mood stabilizers, was not associated with increased efficacy or with increased risk of treatment-emergent affective switch. Longer-term outcome studies are needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of antidepressant therapy for bipolar disorder. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00012558 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).
Summary 2: A recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated no improvement in bipolar depression using paroxetine or bupropion in conjunction with mood stabilizers (primarily lithium or valproate) compared with mood stabilizers alone. However, the trial also showed no difference in treatment-emergent mania between groups.

Query: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document: This study reviewed the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. They searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, PSYNDEX, and LILACS. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients who clinically responded to treatment and the rate of switching to mania. Twelve randomized trials were included, with a total of 1,088 randomly assigned patients. Five trials compared one or more antidepressants with placebo: 75% of these patients were receiving a concurrent mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo. Antidepressants did not induce more switching to mania (the event rate for antidepressants was 3.8% and for placebo, it was 4.7%). Six trials allowed comparison between two antidepressants. The rate of switching for tricyclic antidepressants was 10%, and for all other antidepressants combined, it was 3.2%. Antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The trial data do not suggest that switching is a common early complication of treatment with antidepressants. It may be prudent to use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant as first-line treatment. Given the limited evidence, there is a compelling need for further studies with longer follow-up periods and careful definition and follow-up of emerging mania and partial remission.
Summary:","A systematic review of 4 RCTs (662 patients) found that antidepressants-fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, tranylcypromine, and selegiline (ldeprenyl)-significantly increased treatment response for bipolar type I or II disease at 4 to 10 weeks. About 75% of patients received a concurrent mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic (relative risk [RR]=1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.30; number needed to treat=4.2; 95% CI, 3.2-6.4).1 Although a few head-to-head comparisons suggested that some SSRIs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are more effective first-line agents than tricyclics, the differences were not significant."

Query 1: Can nonantidepressants help treat depression?
Document 1: The delayed onset of therapeutic response and the high number of nonresponders to antidepressants remain major clinical problems in depressive disorders. Among the strategies to overcome both dilemmas, the additional treatment with lithium has been suggested as a viable method. The authors determined in 2 separate meta-analyses the efficacy of lithium in accelerating and in augmenting clinical response in patients with depression. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SOURCES: Two meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder, depressive phase, assessed the concomitant administration of lithium and antidepressant to accelerate or augment clinical response in the acute treatment phase of depression. Data were obtained from searching the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1989 to July 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). For the accelerating meta-analysis, subject headings including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, antidepressive agents, and lithium and text words such as depress*, lithium, and antidepress* were used. For the augmentation meta-analysis, subject headings included depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anti-depressive agents, lithium, drug therapy, and combination, and text words included augment*, refract*, and resistant. Outcomes investigated included response rates and depression scale rates. Five acceleration studies (231 participants) adding lithium to tricyclics and tetracyclics and 10 augmentation studies (269 participants) adding lithium to various antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were incorporated. In the acceleration meta-analysis, a statistical trend in favor of lithium was found (standardized mean difference of -0.43, 95% CI = -0.93 to 0.07). In the augmentation meta-analysis, lithium was significantly more effective than placebo (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.37). There is firm evidence for lithium as an effective augmentation strategy but only modest evidence for lithium to accelerate response to antidepressants in patients with depressive disorders.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 10 augmentation studies reported that adding lithium to various antidepressant agents increased the chances of clinical response 3-fold relative to placebo (odds ratio [OR]=3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-5.37), yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5. The mean response rate was 41.2% in the lithium group and 14.4% in the placebo group (P<.001). The meta-analysis included only RCTs that enrolled subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder (depressive phase) who were treated with any antidepressant plus lithium in any dose compared with placebo.

Query: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document: Improving patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) could be a treatment goal for bipolar depression. The objectives of these secondary analyses of a previous report were to determine the benefits of olanzapine alone and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) for improving HRQOL in patients with bipolar depression using both a generic and a depression-specific HRQOL instrument, and to examine the association between the 2 HRQOL instruments and the construct validity of the depression-specific HRQOL instrument. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 83-site, international, randomized trial. Adults with bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition), were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (6-20 mg/d), OFC (6/25, 12/25, or 12/50 mg/d), or placebo for 8 weeks. HRQOL improvement was calculated as last-observation-carried-forward changes in dimension and component summary scores on Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and total score on the Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). Results: Patients were assigned to receive olanzapine (n = 370), [corrected] OFC (n = 86), or placebo (n = 377) [corrected] for 8 weeks. Of 833 enrolled patients, 454 discontinued (olanzapine, 191/370 [51.6%] [corrected]OFC, 31/86 [36.0%]; and placebo, 232/377 [61.6%]) [corrected] Compared with placebo, olanzapine-treated patients exhibited greater improvements on SF-36 mental component summary (MCS) score ( P=0.002) and 3 of 8 SF-36 dimension scores (mental health [P=0.015], role-emotional [P=0.046], and social functioning [P=0.006). OFC-treated patients exhibited greater improvements on MCS score ( P<0.001) vs both placebo and olanzapine), 5 SF-36 dimension scores (general health perception (P<0.001) vs placebo; (P<0.001) vs olanzapinel, mental health [ P=0.001] vs both placebo and olanzapine], role-emotional [ P<0.001] vs placebo; [P=0.007] vs olanzapine], social functioning [ P=0.001] vs placebo; [P=0.032] vs olanzapine], and vitality [P=0.002] vs placebo; [P=0.011] vs olanzapine]), and QLDS total score ( P<0.001] vs both placebo and olanzapine). Changes in SF-36 scores of mental health, social functioning, role-emotional, and vitality were highly correlated to changes in the QLDS total score (all p < -0.5). Based on these analyses, patients with bipolar depression receiving olanzapine or OFC for 8 weeks had greater improvement in HRQOL than those receiving placebo. OFC treatment was associated with greater improvement in HRQOL than olanzapine alone. The correlation results support the construct validity of the QLDS.
Summary:","A secondary analysis assessed health-related quality of life based on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). OFC treated patients showed greater improvements in general health perception, social functioning, vitality, and a number of other depression markers compared with both the olanzapine monotherapy and placebo groups. However, the SF-36 and QLDS were administered in only 7 of 13 participating countries, possibly skewing results because of variations between countries in sociocultural factors and quality-of-life issues that may also affect mental health."

Query 1: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document 1: There is a major unmet need for effective options in the treatment of bipolar depression. Five hundred forty-two outpatients with bipolar I (N=360) or II (N=182) disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of quetiapine (600 or 300 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Additional efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression of severity and improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Quetiapine at either dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total scores compared with placebo from week 1 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria (> or =50% Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score improvement) at the final assessment in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine were 58.2% and 57.6%, respectively, versus 36.1% for placebo. The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale < or =12) were 52.9% in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine versus 28.4% for placebo. Quetiapine at 600 and 300 mg/day significantly improved 9 of 10 and 8 of 10 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items, respectively, compared to placebo, including the core symptoms of depression. Treatment-emergent mania rates were low and similar for the quetiapine and placebo groups (3.2% and 3.9%, respectively). Quetiapine monotherapy is efficacious and well tolerated for the treatment of bipolar depression.
Summary 1: Two 8-week, double-blind RCTs assessed the efficacy of quetiapine in treating bipolar I or II depression. The first studied 542 outpatients with acute bipolar depression, randomly assigned to quetiapine, 300 mg/day; quetiapine, 600 mg/day; or placebo. Mean changes in montgomery-asberg depression rating scale total scores were the primary outcome measures. Quetiapine showed dose-dependent improvement in montgomery-asberg depression rating scale total scores after the first week (P<.001), with a moderate clinical effect size of 0.67 at 300 mg/day and a large effect size of 0.81 at 600 mg/day.

Query 2: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document 2: This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy for depressive episodes in patients with bipolar I or II disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) who were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with quetiapine (300 or 600 mg/d; once daily, evening dosing) or placebo. Patients were assessed weekly using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The primary end point was change in MADRS total score from baseline to Week 8 (analysis of covariance/last-observation-carried-forward analysis). Of 509 patients randomized, 59% completed the study. Improvements from baseline in mean MADRS total scores were significantly greater with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/d than with placebo from first evaluation (Week 1) through Week 8 (both P <or= 0.001 vs. placebo). Therapeutic effect sizes at Week 8 were 0.61 and 0.54 for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/d, respectively. Improvements in mean HAM-D scores were also significantly greater with both quetiapine doses than with placebo (P < 0.001) as early as Week 1 and throughout the study. The MADRS response and remission rates were also significantly greater in both quetiapine dose groups compared with placebo. Improvements in primary and secondary outcomes were observed with both 300 and 600 mg/d quetiapine without major differences between the doses. Common adverse events included dry mouth, sedation, somnolence, dizziness, and constipation. The incidence of treatment-emergent mania or hypomania was lower with quetiapine treatment than placebo. This study demonstrates that quetiapine monotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, confirming the results observed from a previous study (BipOLar DEpRession [BOLDER] I).
Summary 2: In an RCT, 509 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (300 or 600 mg/day) or placebo and assessed weekly with the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).6 Improvements in mean hamilton depression rating scale scores were greater with both quetiapine doses than with placebo (P<.001). Clinical effect sizes were moderate at week 8 (0.61 at 300 mg/day and 0.54 at 600 mg/day), although dose titration effects were not established.

Query: What drugs are best for bipolar depression?
Document: Despite the longer duration of the depressive phase in bipolar disorder and the frequent clinical use of antidepressants combined with antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, relatively few controlled studies have examined treatment strategies for bipolar depression. To examine the use of olanzapine and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination in the treatment of bipolar I depression. Double-blind, 8-week, randomized controlled trial. Eighty-four sites (inpatient and outpatient) in 13 countries. Patients A total of 833 randomized adults with bipolar I depression with a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of at least 20. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 377); olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 370); or olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, 6 and 25, 6 and 50, or 12 and 50 mg/d (n = 86). Changes in MADRS total scores using mixed-effects model repeated-measures analyses. During all 8 study weeks, the olanzapine and olanzapine-fluoxetine groups showed statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms vs the placebo group (P<.001 for all). The olanzapine-fluoxetine group also showed statistically greater improvement than the olanzapine group at weeks 4 through 8. At week 8, MADRS total scores were lower than at baseline by 11.9, 15.0, and 18.5 points in the placebo, olanzapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine groups, respectively. Remission criteria were met by 24.5% (87/355) of the placebo group, 32.8% (115/351) of the olanzapine group, and 48.8% (40/82) of the olanzapine-fluoxetine group. Treatment-emergent mania (Young Mania Rating Scale score <15 at baseline and > or =15 subsequently) did not differ among groups (placebo, 6.7% [23/345]; olanzapine, 5.7% [19/335]; and olanzapine-fluoxetine, 6.4% [5/78]). Adverse events for olanzapine-fluoxetine therapy were similar to those for olanzapine therapy but also included higher rates of nausea and diarrhea. Olanzapine is more effective than placebo, and combined olanzapine-fluoxetine is more effective than olanzapine and placebo in the treatment of bipolar I depression without increased risk of developing manic symptoms.
Summary:","In a double-blind, 8-week RCT involving 84 international sites, 833 adults with bipolar I depression (MADRS score of ≥20) received olanzapine, an olanzapinefluoxetine combination (OFC), or placebo. Although the trial had a low completion rate (38.5%) and no fluoxetine monotherapy arm, the olanzapine and OFC groups showed improvement in depressive symptoms (defined as ≥50% improvement in the MADRS total score). The olanzapine response rate was 39% (P<.02; odds ratio [OR]=1.46; 95% CI, 1.07-2.00); the OFC response rate was 56.1% (P<.001; OR=2.92; 95% CI, 1.23-3.26). The OFC group showed statistically greater improvement than the olanzapine group."

Query 1: Can recombinant growth hormone effectively treat idiopathic short stature?
Document 1: Idiopathic short stature (ISS) refers to children who are very short compared with their peers for unknown or hereditary reasons. Recombinant human growth hormone has been used to increase growth and final height in children with idiopathic short stature. To assess the effects of recombinant human growth hormone on short-term growth and final height in children with idiopathic short stature. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were sought by searching The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Embase, PubMed, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS and Current Controlled Trials (date of last search 10 December 2002). Article reference lists were assessed for trials and experts and pharmaceutical companies were contacted. Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with ISS with normal growth hormone secretion. Growth hormone (GH) had to be administered for a minimum of six months and be compared with placebo or no treatment. A growth or height outcome measure had to be assessed. Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome was final height and secondary outcomes included short term growth, health related quality of life and adverse effects. To estimate summary treatment effects, data were pooled, when appropriate using a random effects model. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. One trial reported near final height in girls and found that girls treated with growth hormone were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (GH group, 155.3 cm +/- 6.4; control, 147.8 cm +/- 2.6; p = 0.003). The other trials reported short term outcomes. Results suggest that short-term height gains can range from none to approximately 0.7 SD over one year. One study reported health related quality of life and showed no significant improvement in growth hormone treated children compared with those in the control group. No serious adverse effects of treatment have been reported. Results suggest that growth hormone therapy can increase short-term growth and improve (near) final height. Increases in height are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Further research in the form of large, multicentre RCTs are required. These should focus on final height, which is the best outcome for assessing the effects of growth hormone, and address quality of life and cost issues.
Summary 1: Final height is arguably the most important outcome measure for the effects of rGH and may be represented as actual height or as a standard deviation score (SDS)-actual height minus mean height for age divided by standard deviation of height for age. This measure standardizes height comparisons for different age groups and is comparable to the percentile values on growth charts.

Query 2: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 2: The association between obesity and morbidity resulting from chronic diseases is well known. This systematic review addresses studies of the role of rapid growth in infancy and childhood as possible determinants of overweight and obesity later in the life course. We reviewed MEDLINE for studies reporting on growth in infancy and childhood, as well as measures of weight or adiposity in later childhood, adolescence or adulthood. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed using the criteria suggested by Downs and Black. Sixteen articles that fulfilled review criteria were located. There was wide variability in the indicators used for defining rapid growth as well as overweight or obesity. The age range in which weight or adiposity was measured ranged from 3 to 70 years. In spite of differences in definitions used, 13 articles that reported on early rapid growth found significant associations with later overweight or adiposity. Efforts should be made to standardize the definition of rapid growth, as well as that of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. The most frequent definition for rapid growth in this review was a Z-score change greater than 0.67 in weight for age between two different ages in childhood. Regarding obesity, the definition proposed by the International Obesity Task Force also appears to be most appropriate. The present results indicate that early growth is indeed associated with the prevalence of obesity later in the life course.
Summary 2: One descriptive meta-analysis reported that 13 of 15 studies found a positive association between weight gain in the first year of life and overweight later in childhood, although overall odds ratio and relative risk were not reported.

Query: Can recombinant growth hormone effectively treat idiopathic short stature?
Document: To review the indication, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of recombinant human growth hormone in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). A MEDLINE search (1966-December 2003) was performed using the key words human growth hormone, somatropin, Humatrope, normal children, somatrem, and idiopathic short stature. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee Meeting minutes were also reviewed. The data presented in this review were obtained from published literature, abstracts presented at scientific meetings, and information on file with the manufacturer. Additional articles from these sources were also identified. Current issues of pediatric and endocrinology journals were reviewed for the most recent articles. Articles only addressing the use of growth hormone in normal, healthy children were used. Somatropin is indicated for use in children with ISS. Studies have shown modest benefit to final height achieved and, at the doses used for ISS, there have been no adverse effects associated with somatropin. Many questions still exist, however, concerning the most appropriate age to initiate treatment and duration of treatment. There are also many ethical concerns surrounding patient selection criteria and potential for increased off-label use. Growth hormone has been found to have modest efficacy in improving final height in children with ISS. The specific patient population likely to achieve maximal benefit, optimal dosage regimens, and the long-term adverse effects of extended duration of therapy are unknown.
Summary:","rGH has been available since 1985. The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for such conditions as growth hormone deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, Turner syndrome, small size for gestational age, and Prader-Willi syndrome. The use of rGH to treat idiopathic short stature introduces many clinical, economic, and ethical questions. We have attempted to discern the clinical effectiveness of treatment by focusing on RCTs of rGH therapy while leaving the other substantive issues unexplored."

Query 1: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document 1: The original Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP) is a conceptually derived self-report questionnaire designed to predict aberrant medication-related behaviors among chronic pain patients considered for long-term opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an empirically derived version of the SOAPP (SOAPP-R) that addresses some limitations of the original SOAPP. In successive steps, items were reduced from an initial pool of 142 to a 97-item beta version. The beta version was administered to 283 chronic pain patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. Items were evaluated based on data collected at follow-up, including correlation with the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index (ADBI), derived from interview data, physician ratings, and urine toxicology screens. Twenty-four items were retained and comprise the final SOAPP-R. Coefficient alpha was .88, and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of .81 (P < .001). A cutoff score of 18 showed adequate sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.68). The obtained psychometrics, along with the use of a predictive criterion that goes beyond self-report, suggest that the SOAPP-R is an improvement over the original version in screening risk potential for aberrant medication-related behavior among persons with chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: There is a need for a screener for abuse risk in patients prescribed opioids for pain. This study presents a revised version of the SOAPP-R that is empirically derived with good reliability and validity but is less susceptible to overt deception than the original SOAPP version 1.
Summary 1: The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP-R) is a 24-item, self-administered questionnaire that stratifies patients being considered for opioid therapy into lower or higher risk for future opioid-related aberrant behaviors. Each item queries frequency of behaviors and emotions consistent with opioid misuse and can be scored as 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The items on the SOAPP-R were developed by a consensus panel of pain and addiction experts. In a multidisciplinary pain center study, the SOAPP-R was administered to 283 chronic pain patients who were followed for 5 months. At a cutoff score of ≥18, the test had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.80 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.29 for detecting opioid misuse. At this cutoff, the SOAPP-R was 81% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting patients at high risk for aberrant behavior.

Query 2: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document 2: Clinicians recognize the importance of monitoring aberrant medication-related behaviors of chronic pain patients while being prescribed opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) for those pain patients already on long-term opioid therapy. An initial pool of 177 items was developed with input from 26 pain management and addiction specialists. Concept mapping identified six primary concepts underlying medication misuse, which were used to develop an initial item pool. Twenty-two pain and addiction specialists rated the items on importance and relevance, resulting in selection of a 40-item alpha COMM. Final item selection was based on empirical evaluation of items with patients taking opioids for chronic, noncancer pain (N=227). One-week test-retest reliability was examined with 55 participants. All participants were administered the alpha version of the COMM, the Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) interview, and submitted a urine sample for toxicology screening. Physician ratings of patient aberrant behaviors were also obtained. Of the 40 items, 17 items appeared to adequately measure aberrant behavior, demonstrating excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Cutoff scores were examined using ROC curve analysis and reasonable sensitivity and specificity were established. To evaluate the COMM's ability to capture change in patient status, it was tested on a subset of patients (N=86) that were followed and reassessed three months later. The COMM was found to have promise as a brief, self-report measure of current aberrant drug-related behavior. Further cross-validation and replication of these preliminary results is pending.
Summary 2: The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is used to monitor aberrant behaviors in patients on opioid therapy. Scoring for the 17-item, self-administered test is similar to the SOAPP-R. In a study of 86 patients at a multidisciplinary pain center, a score of ≥9 detected opioid misuse with an LR- of 0.08 and an LR+ of 3.48, at a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 66%.

Query: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document: To provide clinicians with a brief screening tool to predict accurately which individuals may develop aberrant behaviors when prescribed opioids for chronic pain. One hundred and eighty-five consecutive new patients treated in one pain clinic took the self-administered Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT measured the following risk factors associated in scientific literature with substance abuse: personal and family history of substance abuse; age; history of preadolescent sexual abuse; and certain psychological diseases. Patients received scores of 0-3 (low risk), 4-7 (moderate risk), or >or= 8 (high risk), indicating the probability of their displaying opioid-related aberrant behaviors. All patients were monitored for aberrant behaviors for 12 months after their initial visits. For those patients with a risk category of low, 17 out of 18 (94.4%) did not display an aberrant behavior. For those patients with a risk category of high, 40 out of 44 (90.9%) did display an aberrant behavior. The authors used the c statistic to validate the ORT, because it simultaneously assesses sensitivity and specificity. The ORT displayed excellent discrimination for both the male (c = 0.82) and the female (c = 0.85) prognostic models. In a preliminary study, among patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain, the ORT exhibited a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for determining which individuals are at risk for opioid-related, aberrant behaviors. Further studies in a variety of pain and nonpain settings are needed to determine the ORT's universal applicability.
Summary:",The ORT study lacked standard measures of addiction.

Query 1: Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy?
Document 1: To investigate the outcomes resulting from the use of fluoroscopically guided therapeutic selective nerve root block (SNRB) in the nonsurgical treatment of atraumatic cervical spondylotic radicular pain. Retrospective study with independent clinical review. Twenty subjects (10 men, 10 women) with mean age 56.6 years. Each patient met specific physical examination, radiographic, and electrodiagnostic criteria to confirm a level of cervical involvement. Those patients whose root level remained indeterminate were required to demonstrate a positive response to a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic SNRB prior to the initiation of treatment. Therapeutic injections were administered in conjunction with physical therapy. Data collection and analysis were performed by an independent clinical reviewer. Pain score, work status, medication usage, and patient satisfaction. Twenty patients with an average symptom duration of 5.8 months were included. An average of 2.2 therapeutic injections was administered. Follow-up data collection transpired at an average of 21.2 months following discharge from treatment. A significant reduction (p = .001) in pain score was observed at the time of follow-up. Medication usage was also significantly improved (p = .005) at the time of follow-up. An overall good or excellent result was observed in 60%. Thirty percent of patients required surgery. Younger patients were more likely (p = .0047) to report the highest patient satisfaction rating following treatment. This study suggests that fluoroscopically guided therapeutic SNRB is a clinically effective intervention in the treatment of atraumatic cervical spondylotic radicular pain.
Summary 1: One case series of cortisone epidural injections reported 60% of patients (12 of 20) had good or excellent response at long-term follow-up (mean follow-up=21.2 months; range=2-45 months). Six of the 20 patients proceeded to surgery.

Query 2: What treatment works best for tennis elbow?
Document 2: Patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) are frequently treated with corticosteroid injections, in order to relieve pain and diminish disability. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference tracking. Two independent reviewers selected and assessed the methodological quality of RCTs that included patients with lateral epicondylitis treated with corticosteroid injection(s), and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Standardised mean differences were computed for continuous data and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. Thirteen studies consisting of 15 comparisons were included in the review, evaluating the effects of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo injection (n=2), injection with local anaesthetic (n=5), another conservative treatment (n=5), or another corticosteroid injection (n=3). Almost all studies had poor internal validity scores. For short-term outcomes (<or=6 weeks), statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were found on pain, global improvement and grip strength for corticosteroid injection compared to placebo, local anaesthetic and conservative treatments. For intermediate (6 weeks-6 months) and long-term outcomes (>or=6 months), no statistically significant or clinically relevant results in favour of corticosteroid injections were found. Although the available evidence shows superior short-term effects of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of injections, due to the lack of high quality studies. No beneficial effects were found for intermediate or long-term follow-up. More, better designed, conducted and reported RCTs with intermediate and long-term follow-up are needed.
Summary 2: A subanalysis of 4 studies in another systematic review found corticosteroid injections to be superior to other conservative treatments such as elbow supports, oral NSAIDs, and physiotherapy at 2 to 6 weeks (RR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.70). The positive effects were not maintained at 6 weeks.

Query: Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy?
Document: Thirty-two patients underwent periradicular corticosteroid injections with a lateral percutaneous approach under fluoroscopic guidance, to treat 34 foci of chronic cervical radiculopathy unresponsive to medical treatment alone. The mean evolutionary trends for radicular and neck pain relief were significant at 14 days (P <.001) and at 6 months (P <.001). The procedure did not produce any complications.
Summary:","A series of 32 patients who had failed conventional treatment showed a 62% response-defined as ""good or excellent"" pain relief-to epidural steroid injection at 14 days. At 6 months, 53% continued to report good or excellent pain relief. No significant side effects occurred. The 44% of patients who didn't report success also didn't report any further deterioration."

Query 1: Should we screen for ovarian cancer?
Document 1: The objectives of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial are to determine in screenees ages 55-74 at entry whether screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy (60-cm sigmoidoscope) can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer, whether screening with chest X-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer, whether screening men with digital rectal examination (DRE) plus serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can reduce mortality from prostate cancer, and whether screening women with CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) can reduce mortality from ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives are to assess screening variables other than mortality for each of the interventions including sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value; to assess incidence, stage, and survival of cancer cases; and to investigate biologic and/or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue and biochemical products as intermediate endpoints. The design is a multicenter, two-armed, randomized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms. In the intervention arm, the PSA and CA125 tests are performed at entry, then annually for 5 years. The DRE, TVU, and chest X-ray exams are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years. Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point. Participants in the control arm follow their usual medical care practices. Participants will be followed for at least 13 years from randomization to ascertain all cancers of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and ovary, as well as deaths from all causes. A pilot phase was undertaken to assess the randomization, screening, and data collection procedures of the trial and to estimate design parameters such as compliance and contamination levels. This paper describes eligibility, consent, and other design features of the trial, randomization and screening procedures, and an outline of the follow-up procedures. Sample-size calculations are reported, and a data analysis plan is presented.
Summary 1: Before screening is implemented, there should be evidence that early detection and treatment of the disease results in improved outcomes. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials address screening of average-risk women, including one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Query 2: Should we screen for ovarian cancer?
Document 2: To estimate the performance of currently available tests in detecting ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. Systematic review of prospective screening studies. Twenty-five studies were identified: sixteen studied women at average risk and nine studied women at higher risk. Most studies evaluated only one screening method, were small, detecting few cancers, and gave few follow up details. Sensitivity estimates are therefore imprecise. In a typical larger study, reported sensitivity of ultrasound screening at one year was around 100% (95% CI 54%-100%), while the sensitivity of CA125 measurement followed by ultrasound (multimodal screening) was about 80% (95% CI 49%-95%). False positive rates ranged between 1.2% and 2.5% for grey scale ultrasound, between 0.3% and 0.7% for ultrasound with colour Doppler and between 0.1% and 0.6% for multimodal screening. This implies that, in annual screening of a population with an incidence of 40 per 100,000, and if no cancers were missed, between 2.5 and 60 women would undergo surgery for every primary ovarian cancer detected. Ultrasound and multimodal screening can detect ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women, but there is currently no evidence on whether screening improves outcome for women in any risk group. On-going randomised controlled trials should establish the magnitude of any benefit of screening. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer in the population, and its rate of progression, may limit the potential cost-effectiveness of screening.
Summary 2: There is indirect evidence that early detection prolongs survival, as well as evidence that screening results in an increase in diagnosing a tumor at stage 1.

Query: Should we screen for ovarian cancer?
Document: The value of screening for ovarian cancer is uncertain. We did a pilot randomised trial to assess multimodal screening with sequential CA 125 antigen and ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women aged 45 years or older were randomised to a control group (n=10,977) or screened group (n=10,958). Women randomised to screening were offered three annual screens that involved measurement of serum CA 125, pelvic ultrasonography if CA 125 was 30 U/mL or more, and referral for gynaecological opinion if ovarian volume was 8.8 mL or more on ultrasonography. All women were followed up to see whether they developed invasive epithelial cancers of the ovary or fallopian tube (index cancers). Of 468 women in the screened group with a raised CA 125, 29 were referred for a gynaecological opinion; screening detected an index cancer in six and 23 had false-positive screening results. The positive predictive value was 20.7%. During 7-year follow-up, ten further women with index cancers were identified in the screened group and 20 in the control group. Median survival of women with index cancers in the screened group was 72.9 months and in the control group was 41.8 months (p=0.0112). The number of deaths from an index cancer did not differ significantly between the control and screened groups (18 of 10,977 vs nine of 10,958, relative risk 2.0 [95% CI 0.78-5.13]). These results show that a multimodal approach to ovarian cancer screening in a randomised trial is feasible and justify a larger randomised trial to see whether screening affects mortality.
Summary:","A large pilot study showed improved median survival in a screened group compared with a control group (72.9 months vs 41.8 months), but there was no significant difference in either mortality from ovarian cancer or all-cause mortality."

Query 1: Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective for recurrent acute otitis media?
Document 1: To determine the effectiveness of amoxicillin administered continuously twice daily vs. once daily vs. placebo to prevent new episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a hospital-based general pediatric clinic and a private pediatric practice, both in Denver, CO. One hundred ninety-four children (age 3 months through 6 years) were enrolled with 3 documented AOM episodes within the prior 6 months, without ventilating tubes or associated anatomic defects, immunodeficiency disorders or allergy to penicillin. Thirty-six were noncompliant and were excluded from the study, leaving 158 evaluable subjects. The amoxicillin dosage was 20 mg/kg/day either bid or qd. After randomization to placebo twice daily (bid), amoxicillin once daily (qd)/placebo qd or amoxicillin bid, patients were followed monthly and were also seen for upper respiratory infection symptoms during enrollment in the trial. Development of two new AOM episodes terminated the patients from the study. Incidence density (ID) measurements were calculated for all study subjects and were stratified by age and season. Overall study subjects in all 3 arms of the trial had 7243 days at risk during which time they developed 56 new AOM episodes for a annual ID of 2.82. There were no significant differences in the IDs between amoxicillin qd vs. bid or amoxicillin (bid or qd) vs. placebo. After stratifying by age and season of enrollment, there were no significant differences in ID rates among the 3 groups. The proportion of subjects remaining otitis-free was 63% for the placebo group, 64% for once daily amoxicillin and 61% for twice daily amoxicillin. While once-a-day dosing was equivalent to twice-a-day dosing for amoxicillin prophylaxis, there was no benefit of amoxicillin prophylaxis compared with a placebo control in preventing new AOM episodes. Because of the potential of excessive antibiotic use to promote the acquisition of resistant pneumococci and the lack of effectiveness in this trial, routine use of amoxicillin prophylaxis should be discouraged.
Summary 1: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of prophylaxis for ear infections enrolled 194 children aged 3 months to 6 years with at least 3 documented acute otitis media episodes in the preceding 6 months. The children were given amoxicillin (20 mg/kg/d) either once daily (n=55) or divided twice daily (n=44) or placebo (n=59). Excluding 36 noncompliant subjects, the percentages without a recurrent episode were 63% for the placebo group, 64% for the once-daily amoxicillin group, and 61% for the twice-daily amoxicillin group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new acute otitis media episodes among the children in the 3 groups.

Query 2: Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media?
Document 2: To determine the efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion in preventing recurrences of acute otitis media, we randomized 264 children 7 to 35 months of age who had a history of recurrent otitis media but were free of middle ear effusion to receive either amoxicillin prophylaxis, bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion or placebo. The average rate of new episodes per child year of either acute otitis media or otorrhea was 0.60 in the amoxicillin group, 1.08 in the placebo group and 1.02 in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P less than 0.001; tubes vs. placebo, P = 0.25). The average proportion of time with otitis media of any type was 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, 15.0% in the placebo group and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P = 0.03; tubes vs. placebo, P less than 0.001). At the 2-year end point, the rate of attrition was 42.2% in the amoxicillin group, 45.5% in the placebo group and 26.7% in the tympanostomy tube group. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 7.0% of the amoxicillin group and persistent tympanic membrane perforations developed in 3.9% of the tympanostomy tube group. The observed degree of efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion must be viewed in light of the fact that study subjects proved not to have been at as high risk for acute otitis media as had been anticipated and in view of the differential attrition rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary 2: One randomized controlled trial of 264 children, aged 7 to 35 months, with a history of recurrent acute otitis media but free of middle-ear effusion, compared tubes with medical therapy and found no difference in recurrence over 2 years. The medical therapy arm received prophylaxis with either amoxicillin or placebo. The amoxicillin arm had 0.6 fewer episodes of acute otitis media per year compared with the other 2, a statistically significant 40% decrease (relative risk reduction=0.4). The average time with otitis media of any type (acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, or ottorhea) also decreased-15.0% in the placebo group, 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P=.03; tubes vs. placebo, P<.001). Higher dropout rates occurred in the amoxicillin and medical treatment groups.

Query: Are nasal steroid sprays effective for otitis media with effusion?
Document: Description of the natural course of otitis media with effusion (OME) in pre-school children. Longitudinal follow-up study. Nijmegen, the Netherlands; at the children's home address. A cohort of 1439 children born in the period September 1982 to August 1983 and living in Nijmegen at their second birthday were invited for participation in serial tympanometric screening with a three-monthly interval. Each child was measured 9 times from age 24 to 48 months. A flat tympanogram was considered to be indicative of OME. Participation was 92%, but interpretable tympanograms were taken in 2242 ears (first round) to 1990 ears (last screening). Data of 56 children treated with grommets were excluded from analysis. Longstanding OME (at least 4 flat tympanograms in a succession) was seen in 9.3% (95%-CI 7.0-11.6) of ears. In another 23.4% (20.1-26.8) of ears OME was found 2 or 3 times at subsequent screenings. Single or recurrent flat tympanograms were seen in 20.4% (17.2-23.6) and 11.6% (9.0-14.1) of the ears respectively. The probability of recovery over time was well described with a simple function of a 50% improvement every 3 months. In addition, 50% of the recovered ears showed one or more recurrences of OME. OME appears to run a very fluctuating course with a strong representation of short disease episodes and high rates of recovery and remission. The data confirm the results of others. A common interpretation, i.e. a sharp reduction of the recovery rate after three months, appears to be false. A 50% improvement rate every 3 months fits the data equally well. This study does not provide information about the sequelae of OME at school age.
Summary:",The natural course of OME was observed in a longitudinal cohort study of 1439 children aged 2 years in the Netherlands. Single or recurrent flat screening tympanograms were noted in 20% and remitted spontaneously at a rate of 50% every 3 months. This prevalence and spontaneous resolution rate is consistent with other studies.

Query 1: Do glucosamine and chondroitin worsen blood sugar control in diabetes?
Document 1: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and it is often associated with significant disability and an impaired quality of life. To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in OA. We searched MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CDSR, and the CCTR. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles. All searches were updated in January 2005. Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo controlled and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double blinded studies were eligible. Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1996) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMD) as the measure of effect size. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk ratios (RR). Analysis restricted to eight studies with adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit of glucosamine for pain and WOMAC function. Collectively, the 20 analyzed RCTs found glucosamine favoured placebo with a 28% (change from baseline) improvement in pain (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95, -0.28) and a 21% (change from baseline) improvement in function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). However, the results are not uniformly positive, and the reasons for this remain unexplained. WOMAC pain, function and stiffness outcomes did not reach statistical significance. In the 10 RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior for pain (SMD -1.31, 95% CI -1.99, -0.64) and function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). Pooled results for pain (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.35, 0.05) and function using the WOMAC index (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.18, 0.25) in those RCTs in which a non-Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo did not reach statistical significance. In the four RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two. Two RCTs using the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was able to slow radiological progression of OA of the knee over a three year period (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.04, 0.43). Glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of the number of subjects reporting adverse reactions (RR=0.97, 95% CI, 0.88, 1.08). This update includes 20 studies with 2570 patients. Pooled results from studies using a non-Rotta preparation or adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit in pain and WOMAC function while those studies evaluating the Rotta preparation show that glucosamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic OA. WOMAC outcomes of pain, stiffness and function did not show a superiority of glucosamine over placebo for both Rotta and non-Rotta preparations of glucosamine. Glucosamine was as safe as placebo.
Summary 1: A Cochrane systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 2570 patients in order to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in osteoarthritis found that glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of adverse reactions. However, they did not comment specifically on diabetic patients or hyperglycemia per se.

Query 2: Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain?
Document 2: Glucosamine and chondroitin preparations are widely touted in the lay press as remedies for osteoarthritis (OA), but uncertainty about their efficacy exists among the medical community. To evaluate benefit of glucosamine and chondroitin preparations for OA symptoms using meta-analysis combined with systematic quality assessment of clinical trials of these preparations in knee and/or hip OA. We searched for human clinical trials in MEDLINE (1966 to June 1999) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis, degenerative arthritis, glucosamine, chondroitin, and glycosaminoglycans. We also manually searched review articles, manuscripts, and supplements from rheumatology and OA journals and sought unpublished data by contacting content experts, study authors, and manufacturers of glucosamine or chondroitin. Studies were included if they were published or unpublished double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 4 or more weeks' duration that tested glucosamine or chondroitin for knee or hip OA and reported extractable data on the effect of treatment on symptoms. Fifteen of 37 studies were included in the analysis. Reviewers performed data extraction and scored each trial using a quality assessment instrument. We computed an effect size from the intergroup difference in mean outcome values at trial end, divided by the SD of the outcome value in the placebo group (0.2, small effect; 0.5, moderate; 0.8, large), and applied a correction factor to reduce bias. We tested for trial heterogeneity and publication bias and stratified for trial quality and size. We pooled effect sizes using a random effects model. Quality scores ranged from 12.3% to 55.4% of the maximum, with a mean (SD) of 35.5% (12%). Only 1 study described adequate allocation concealment and 2 reported an intent-to-treat analysis. Most were supported or performed by a manufacturer. Funnel plots showed significant asymmetry (P< or =.01) compatible with publication bias. Tests for heterogeneity were nonsignificant after removing 1 outlier trial. The aggregated effect sizes were 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.64) for glucosamine and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) for chondroitin, but they were diminished when only high-quality or large trials were considered. The effect sizes were relatively consistent for pain and functional outcomes. Trials of glucosamine and chondroitin preparations for OA symptoms demonstrate moderate to large effects, but quality issues and likely publication bias suggest that these effects are exaggerated. Nevertheless, some degree of efficacy appears probable for these preparations.
Summary 2: Those problems account for the relatively low quality scores of the studies used in meta-analyses, particularly in earlier ones. Quality scores range from 12% to 52% of optimal and make any definitive conclusions suspect. The magnitude of the treatment effect is variable. Meta-analyses demonstrate aggregate treatment effects ranging from 0.36 to 1.02- where a small effect is 0.2, a moderate effect is 0.5, and a large effect is 0.8.

Query: Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain?
Document: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and it is often associated with significant disability and an impaired quality of life. To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in osteoarthritis (OA). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Current Contents up to November 1999, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles. Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo based and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double-blinded studies were eligible. Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1995) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using Peto Odds Ratios. Collectively, the 16 identified RCTs provided evidence that glucosamine is both effective and safe in OA. In the 13 RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior in all RCTs, except one. In the four RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two. Further research is necessary to confirm the long term effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine therapy in OA. Most of the trials reviewed only evaluated the Rotta preparation of glucosamine sulfate. It is not known whether different glucosamine preparations prepared by different manufacturers are equally effective in the therapy of OA.
Summary:","Typical trends suggest that glucosamine is superior to placebo for pain relief, and less effective but safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents."

Query 1: What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions?
Document 1: Virus isolation in cell culture is the recognised diagnostic gold standard for genital herpes. Although increasing evidence indicates that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a more rapid and sensitive diagnostic method, its implementation in routine diagnostic settings has been limited by concerns over contamination and cost. To evaluate the feasibility of replacing virus culture with PCR for the diagnosis of genital herpes in settings serving large populations of genitourinary medicine (GUM) attendees. Genital swabs collected from 233 consecutive GUM attendees with suspected genital herpes were tested in parallel by virus culture and automated real time PCR. Three specimen preparation methods were evaluated and the assay reliability was assessed by repeat testing, comparison with a commercially available assay, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) sequence analysis. Probe melting temperatures (Tm) were used to differentiate between HSV types without additional post-PCR steps. HSV was detected in 79/233 (34%) samples by virus culture and 132/233 (57%) samples by PCR. PCR significantly increased HSV detection in both early (< 5 days) and late (> or = 5 days) presentations and in both first and recurrent episodes. HSV detection and typing by PCR was achieved within less than 4 hours leading to a significant reduction in labour compared to virus culture. Most specimens (120/132, 91%) were typed as HSV-2. Results were highly reproducible. Real time PCR is a highly reproducible, rapid, and labour efficient method for HSV detection in genital swabs. Its implementation is feasible in routine diagnostic settings.
Summary 1: In London, 233 samples from patients at a genitourinary medicine clinic were tested with both viral culture and PCR. herpes simplex virus was detected in 79 samples by culture and 132 samples by PCR. The detection by PCR was higher in early as well as late stages of infection and in both first and recurrent episodes. The reference standard for these studies was not an independent standard, but a positive result on both tests or modified versions of the PCR test. The use of a version of the test of interest (PCR) as part of the reference standard, while probably unavoidable in this situation, will tend inflate the sensitivity and specificity.

Summary 2: A British study found the rate of virus recovery for early vesicles to be 52% to 93%. This dropped to 41% to 72% if midstage ulcers were present. Finally, the detection for late-stage crusted lesions was only 19% to 27%. Another disadvantage is that culture is labor-intensive. A positive culture takes an average of 3 days to grow, whereas a negative culture must incubate for 10 days. PCR techniques are more sensitive and results can be available in less than 4 hours.

Query: What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions?
Document: The sensitivity of a rapid enzyme immunoassay test (HerpChek Direct Herpes Simplex Virus Antigen Test [DuPont Medical Products, Wilmington, Del.]) for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens in patient specimens was compared with HSV culture. HerpChek positivity for HSV occurred with 179 (65%) of 275 lesion specimens, whereas culture for HSV was positive for 145 (53%) lesions (P = 0.002). HerpChek was twice as sensitive as culture for the detection of HSV in late-stage lesions and was equivalent to culture for the detection of HSV in early lesions. We conclude that HerpChek provides greater sensitivity than culture for HSV detection in late-stage genital lesions.
Summary:","In a study using 275 samples from genital lesions, HSV was detected in 65% of the antigen tests and 53% of the viral cultures. The sensitivity of this method is equal to culture for early lesions, but much higher in late-stage lesions (58% vs 26%)."

Query 1: How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage?
Document 1: To evaluate the uptake and outcome of expectant management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage in an early pregnancy assessment unit. 1096 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage. Each miscarriage was classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic on the basis of ultrasonography. Women who needed treatment were given the choice of expectant management or surgical evacuation of retained products of conception under general anaesthesia. Women undergoing expectant management were checked a few days after transvaginal bleeding had stopped, or they were monitored at weekly intervals for four weeks. A complete miscarriage (absence of transvaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness <15 mm), the number of women completing their miscarriage within each week of management, and complications (excessive pain or transvaginal bleeding necessitating hospital admission or clinical evidence of infection). Two patients with molar pregnancies were excluded, and 37% of the remainder (408/1094) were classified as having had a complete miscarriage. 70% (478/686) of women with retained products of conception chose expectant management; of these, 27 (6%) were lost to follow up. A successful outcome without surgical intervention was seen in 81% of cases (367/451). The rate of spontaneous completion was 91% (201/221) for those cases classified as incomplete miscarriage, 76% (105/138) for missed miscarriage, and 66% (61/92) for anembryonic pregnancy. 70% of women completed their miscarriage within 14 days of classification (84% for incomplete miscarriage and 52% for missed miscarriage and anembryonic pregnancy). Most women with retained products of conception chose expectant management. Ultrasonography can be used to advise patients on the likelihood that their miscarriage will complete spontaneously within a given time.
Summary 1: An observational study evaluated 1096 consecutive patients with suspected first-trimester abortion, classified by ultrasound as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic. In the latter 3 categories, patients chose expectant management (478) or immediate surgical evacuation (208). Those choosing expectant management were monitored weekly and offered surgical evacuation if their abortion was incomplete after 1 month. Complications arose in 6 of 451 patients (1%) managed expectantly for up to 46 days, and in 5 of 208 patients (2%) managed surgically (not statistically significant). One patient in the expectant group had emergency surgery and blood transfusion.

Query 2: How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage?
Document 2: Spontaneous abortion is a common problem in everyday clinical practice, accounting for 15 to 20 percent of all recognized pregnancies. The traditional treatment of this problem has been surgical, emptying the uterus by dilatation and curettage (D&C). Recent therapeutic and laboratory advances call surgical therapy into question for many patients. It is believed that this pooled quantitative literature evaluation is the first with the goal to clarify the roles of expectant, medical, and surgical treatment of this common problem. The literature review was focused on published studies in the English language of outcomes of therapy for spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. We looked for both observational and randomized controlled trials. A successful outcome of treatment required that three criteria be met: vaginal bleeding stopped by 3 weeks, products of conception fully expelled by 2 weeks, and absence of complications. Pooled weighted average success estimates and standard errors were determined for each study; 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated for each form of treatment. Sensitivity analysis compared randomized controlled trials with observational studies for both expectant and surgical treatment. Of the 31 studies retrieved, 18 met inclusion criteria, including 9 involving expectant treatment (545 pooled patients), 3 for medical treatment (prostaglandin or antiprogesterone agents) (198 pooled patients), and 10 for surgical treatment (D&C) (1408 pooled patients). Successful outcomes were found in 92.5 percent of patients receiving expectant treatment, in 93.6 percent of those undergoing D&C, and in 51.5 percent of patients receiving medical treatment. Expectant management of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester is safe and effective for many afebrile patients whose blood pressure and heart rate are stable and who have no excess bleeding or unacceptable pain. Transvaginal sonographic studies might be useful in patient selection, and serial chorionic gonadotropin monitoring should be considered while observing the initial course of expectant treatment. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support medical therapy of spontaneous abortion, and further research is needed to clarify the more limited role of surgical treatment.
Summary 2: A systematic review of 18 studies, including 3 RCTs, compared outcomes for expectant management (545 women) vs surgical evacuation (1408 women) for first-trimester spontaneous abortion. A successful first-trimester spontaneous abortion was defined as vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks or less, fully expelled products of conception by 14 days, and no complications (infection, transfusion, uterine perforation, hospitalization, or death). Expectant management was successful in 93% overall, and 80% using only the data from RCTs.

Query: How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage?
Document: This study of patients with first trimester miscarriage evaluates whether conservative management is a feasible strategy and assesses the value of colour Doppler ultrasonography for patient selection. After confirmation of the diagnosis by transvaginal sonography all patients were offered the choice of immediate dilatation and curettage or conservative management. The presence of a gestational sac, the occurrence of spontaneous complete miscarriage within 28 days, detectable pulsatile blood flow within the placenta in the presumed region of the intervillous space and post-treatment complications were the main end-points. Out of a total of 108 women recruited, 23 (21.3%) elected to undergo immediate dilatation and curettage and 85 (78.7%) chose conservative management. The treatment groups were similar in age, gestational age, gestational sac diameter, serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and progesterone, and proportion of patients who had post-treatment complications (12-13%). Of patients in the conservative management group, 71 out of 85 (84%) had a spontaneous, complete abortion, while 37 out of 46 cases (80%) with detectable presumed intervillous pulsatile blood flow had a complete, spontaneous abortion within 1 week; this occurred in 23% of cases with no detectable flow. This suggests that conservative management is a successful approach for many patients with first trimester miscarriage; colour Doppler ultrasonography can be used to select the most suitable patients for this strategy, and thus reduce the need for hospital admission and surgery.
Summary:",An observational study evaluated 108 women with first-trimester missed abortions or anembryonic pregnancies who chose either expectant (85 women) or surgical management. They were followed with weekly ultrasound (including color Doppler imaging) and serum β-hCG for up to 1 month. Fifty-three (62%) completed a spontaneous abortion at 14 days and 71 (84%) at 28 days. There were no significant differences in the rate of complications.

Query: How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage?
Document: Early pregnancy loss is a profound adverse life event for many women, and increased psychiatric morbidity has been shown to occur after spontaneous abortion. Dilatation and curettage (D&C) has been the cornerstone in the treatment of first trimester spontaneous abortion over the last few decades. During recent years the possibility of conservative management has, however, been increasingly discussed. In a prospective randomized trial, we compared psychological reactions and morbidity, after either expectant management or D&C, for miscarriages of < 13 weeks gestation in which a transvaginal ultrasound examination showed intrauterine tissue and/or blood clots with an antero-posterior diameter of between 15 and 50 mm. Of the 86 patients included, 58 were randomized to expectant management and 28 to primary D&C. In patients randomized to expectant management, pregnancy products shown by transvaginal ultrasound disappeared within 3 days in 43 cases (74%), whereas 15 patients (26%) underwent D&C owing to retained products of conception after 3 days. At 2 weeks after inclusion, all patients answered self-administered questionnaires, including visual analogue scales, concerning their experience of the pregnancy loss, the present situation and concerns about the future. A brief anxiety status inventory was included. This study showed no increase in anxiety or depressive reactions 2 weeks after a first trimester spontaneous abortion when these patients were compared with non-pregnant healthy working females 19-39 years of age. Moreover, there were no significant differences in psychological reactions between patients managed either expectantly or by D&C.
Summary:","A prospective trial compared psychological morbidity for 86 women with ultrasound-confirmed first-trimester missed abortions, randomized to expectant or surgical management. At 2 weeks, a self-administered questionnaire about the experience of pregnancy loss found no significant difference in psychological reactions. No increase was seen in anxiety or depression symptoms between women who had miscarried and healthy nonpregnant working women aged 19 to 39 years."

Query 1: Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia?
Document 1: Although statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged individuals, their efficacy and safety in elderly people is not fully established. Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 34% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00, p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability. Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.
Summary 1: The PROSPER trial, which was designed to test the effect of pravastatin Pravachol on coronary heart disease and stroke, randomized 5804 study participants into 1 group assigned to take pravastatin and another group assigned to take placebo. An additional study endpoint was pravastatin's effect on cognitive function as measured by 4 different tests, including the Mini-Mental Status Exam MMSE. Overall cognitive function declined at the same rate in treatment and placebo groups. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups over 3 years using 4 different methods of assessment. In particular, the MMSE scores differed by only 0.06 points 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.16; P=.26.

Query 2: Should we treat elevated cholesterol in elderly patients?
Document 2: Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the administration of pravastatin to men with hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction reduced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. We randomly assigned 6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean (+/- SD) plasma cholesterol level of 272 +/- 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. Medical records, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry were used to determine the clinical end points. Pravastatin lowered plasma cholesterol levels by 20 percent and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248 definite coronary events (specified as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk with pravastatin, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P < 0.001). There were similar reductions in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P < 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent reduction, P = 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduction, P = 0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P = 0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40 percent; P = 0.051). Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.
Summary 2: Available evidence addressing the benefit of lowering lipid levels in persons with elevated cholesterol but without coronary heart disease is from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention study, which included patients aged 45 to 64 years. This study showed a 0.5% reduction in coronary heart disease mortality (NNT = 200) and a 0.9% reduction in all-cause mortality (NNT = 111). Neither reduction reached statistical significance.

Query: Should we treat elevated cholesterol in elderly patients?
Document: The effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on death from coronary heart disease in older patients with previous coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels is uncertain. To compare the relative and absolute effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease who are 65 years of age or older with those in patients 31 to 64 years of age. Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 87 centers in Australia and New Zealand. 3514 patients 65 to 75 years of age, chosen from among 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol level of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L (155 to 271 mg/dL). Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo. Major cardiovascular disease events over 6 years. Older patients were at greater risk than younger patients (31 to 64 years of age) for death (20.6% vs. 9.8%), myocardial infarction (11.4% vs. 9.5%), unstable angina (26.7% vs. 23.2%), and stroke (6.7% vs. 3.1%) (all P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced the risk for all cardiovascular disease events, and similar relative effects were observed in older and younger patients. In patients 65 to 75 years of age, pravastatin therapy reduced mortality by 21% (CI, 7% to 32%), death from coronary heart disease by 24% (CI, 7% to 38%), coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 22% (CI, 9% to 34%), myocardial infarction by 26% (CI, 9% to 40%), and stroke by 12% (CI, -15% to 32%). For every 1000 older patients treated over 6 years, pravastatin prevented 45 deaths, 33 myocardial infarctions, 32 unstable angina events, 34 coronary revascularization procedures, 13 strokes, or 133 major cardiovascular events, compared with 22 deaths and 107 major cardiovascular events per 1000 younger patients. Among older patients, the numbers needed to treat were 22 (CI, 17 to 36) to prevent one death from any cause, 35 (CI, 24 to 67) to prevent one death from coronary heart disease, and 21 (CI, 17 to 31) to prevent one coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. In older patients with coronary heart disease and average or moderately elevated cholesterol levels, pravastatin therapy reduced the risk for all major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Since older patients are at greater risk than younger patients for these events, the absolute benefit of treatment is significantly greater in older patients.
Summary:","The overall decrease in absolute risk of death was similar (range, 4.1%-6.2%; numbers needed to treat [NNT] = 17-25). The LIPID trial demonstrated a reduction in CHD-related death (relative risk [RR] = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93; NNT = 37) and myocardial infarctions (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91; NNT = 36) in elderly patients taking pravastatin 40 mg once daily for 6 years compared with placebo."

Query 1: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 1: Recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) has been suggested as a good alternative laxative to lactulose as a treatment option in paediatric constipation. However, no large randomised controlled trials exist evaluating the efficacy of either laxative. To compare PEG 3350 (Transipeg: polyethylene glycol with electrolytes) with lactulose in paediatric constipation and evaluate clinical efficacy/side effects. One hundred patients (aged 6 months-15 years) with paediatric constipation were included in an eight week double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. After faecal disimpaction, patients <6 years of age received PEG 3350 (2.95 g/sachet) or lactulose (6 g/sachet) while children > or =6 years started with 2 sachets/day. Primary outcome measures were: defecation and encopresis frequency/week and successful treatment after eight weeks. Success was defined as a defecation frequency > or =3/week and encopresis < or =1 every two weeks. Secondary outcome measures were side effects after eight weeks of treatment. A total of 91 patients (49 male) completed the study. A significant increase in defecation frequency (PEG 3350: 3 pre v 7 post treatment/week; lactulose: 3 pre v 6 post/week) and a significant decrease in encopresis frequency (PEG 3350: 10 pre v 3 post/week; lactulose: 8 pre v 3 post/week) was found in both groups (NS). However, success was significantly higher in the PEG group (56%) compared with the lactulose group (29%). PEG 3350 patients reported less abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation than children using lactulose. However, bad taste was reported significantly more often in the PEG group. PEG 3350 (0.26 (0.11) g/kg), compared with lactulose (0.66 (0.32) g/kg), provided a higher success rate with fewer side effects. PEG 3350 should be the laxative of first choice in childhood constipation.
Summary 1: One good-quality randomized controlled trials (100 children, 6 months to 15 years old with CFC) compared polyethylene glycol + E with lactulose. Both significantly increased stool frequency and decreased encopresis. However, polyethylene glycol + E had a markedly higher success rate (56% vs 29%; NNT=3.7; P=.02). The 8-week trial found significantly more complaints about bad taste in the polyethylene glycol + E group; the lactulose group reported higher rates of abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation. The only dropout because of adverse events (bad taste) occurred in the polyethylene glycol + E group.

Document 2: To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG+E) for the treatment of chronic constipation in children. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial, with two 2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week placebo washout. Six UK paediatric departments. 51 children (29 girls, 22 boys) aged 24 months to 11 years with chronic constipation (lasting > or =3 months), defined as < or =2 complete bowel movements per week and one of the following: pain on defaecation on 25% of days; > or =25% of bowel movements with straining; > or =25% of bowel movements with hard/lumpy stools. 47 children completed the double blind treatment. Number of complete defaecations per week (primary efficacy variable), total number of complete and incomplete defaecations per week, pain on defaecation, straining on defaecation, faecal incontinence, stool consistency, global assessment of treatment, adverse events and physical examination. The mean number of complete defaecations per week was significantly higher for children on PEG+E than on placebo (3.12 (SD 2.05) v 1.45 (SD 1.20), respectively; p<0.001). Further significant differences in favour of PEG+E were observed for total number of defaecations per week (p = 0.003), pain on defaecation (p = 0.041), straining on defaecation (p<0.001), stool consistency (p<0.001) and percentage of hard stools (p = 0.001). Treatment related adverse events (all mild or moderate) occurred in similar numbers of children on PEG+E (41%) and placebo during treatment (45%). PEG+E is significantly more effective than placebo, and appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
Summary 2: A recent high-quality randomized controlled trials compared the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E) with placebo in 51 children with CFC, 2 to 11 years of age. The mean number of defecations per week was higher for children on polyethylene glycol + E (3.12 vs 1.45; P<.001); straining or pain and stool consistency improved.

Query: What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year?
Document: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and lactulose were compared in an unblinded, randomized, crossover design for treatment of constipation in 37 children aged 2 to 16 years. Subjects received lactulose (1.3 g/kg/d divided twice daily up to 20 g) or PEG 3350 (10 g/m2/day) for 2 weeks. PEG 3350 significantly decreased the total colonic transit time compared to lactulose (47.6+/-2.7 vs 55.3+/-2.4 hours, mean +/- SE, PEG 3350 vs lactulose, respectively, p = 0.038). The stool frequency, form, and the ease of passage were similar for each laxative. Polyethylene glycol 3350 is an effective laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
Summary:","Laxative therapies were compared in 2 studies. An unblinded, randomized, crossover trial enrolled 37 children referred for subspecialty evaluation of functional constipation. It found that PEG 3350 and lactulose were equivalent in improving stool frequency, stool form, and ease of passage. However, there was a significant difference in total stool transit time in subjects taking PEG compared with those taking lactulose (47.6 hours vs 55.3 hours, respectively; P=.038). In addition, twice as many parents and guardians rated PEG effective as those rating lactulose effective (84% vs 46%); and 73% of parents preferred PEG to lactulose."

Query 1: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 1: Constipation and encopresis are common problems in children. Still today, the role of fiber in the treatment of chronic constipation in childhood is controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether fiber supplementation is beneficial in the treatment of children with functional constipation with or without encopresis. We used glucomannan as the fiber supplement. We evaluated the effect of fiber (glucomannan, a fiber gel polysaccharide from the tubers of the Japanese Konjac plant) and placebo in children with chronic functional constipation with and without encopresis in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. After the initial evaluation, the patients were disimpacted with 1 or 2 phosphate enemas if a rectal impaction was felt during rectal examination. Patients continued with their preevaluation laxative. No enemas were given during each treatment period. Fiber and placebo were given as 100 mg/kg body weight daily (maximal 5 g/day) with 50 mL fluid/500 mg for 4 weeks each. Parents were asked to have children sit on the toilet 4 times daily after meals and to keep a stool diary. Age, frequency of bowel movements into the toilet and into the undergarment, presence of abdominal pain, dietary fiber intake, medications, and the presence of an abdominal and/or a rectal fecal mass were recorded on a structured form at the time of recruitment and 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. Children were rated by the physician as successfully treated when they had > or =3 bowel movements/wk and < or =1 soiling/3 weeks with no abdominal pain in the last 3 weeks of each 4-week treatment period. Parents made a global assessments to whether they believed that the child was better during the first or second treatment period. Forty-six chronically constipated children were recruited into the study, but only 31 children completed the study. These 31 children (16 boys and 15 girls) were 4.5 to 11.7 years of age (mean: 7 +/- 2 years). All children had functional constipation; in addition, 18 had encopresis when recruited for the study. No significant side effects were reported during each 4-week treatment period. Significantly fewer children complained of abdominal pain and more children were successfully treated while on fiber (45%) as compared with placebo treatment (13%). Parents rated significantly more children (68%) as being better on fiber versus 13% as being better on placebo. The initial fiber intake was low in 22 (71%) children. There was no difference in the percentage of children with low fiber intake living in the United States (70%) and Italy (71%). Successful treatment (physician rating) and improvement (parent rating) were independent of low or acceptable initial fiber intake. The duration of chronic constipation ranged from 0.6 to 10 years (mean: 4.0 +/- 2.5 years). Duration of constipation did not predict response to fiber treatment. Children with constipation only were significantly more likely to be treated successfully with fiber (69%) than those with constipation and encopresis (28%). We found glucomannan to be beneficial in the treatment of constipation with and without encopresis in children. Symptomatic children who were already on laxatives still benefited from the addition of fiber. Therefore, we suggest that we continue with the recommendation to increase the fiber in the diet of constipated children with and without encopresis.
Summary 1: A fair-quality crossover randomized controlled trials (31 children, mean age 7 years, with CFC) compared fiber (glucomannan) with placebo for 4 weeks. More children were successfully treated with fiber than placebo (45% vs 13%; number needed to treat [NNT]=3.125; P<.05). Parents rated children as doing better on fiber (68% vs 13%), and abdominal pain occurred less often (10% vs 42%; P<.05). No adverse effects were associated with fiber.

Query 2: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 2: Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives. The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis. The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field. All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the administering of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment. No trials were found that met the selection criteria. No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria. The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.
Summary 2: A Cochrane systematic review found no RCTs of stimulant laxatives for chronic functional constipation of children and concluded that evidence concerning the efficacy of these agents is insufficient.

Query: What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year?
Document: Chronic constipation is one of the most common disorders in Western countries and despite numerous clinical, pathophysiologic, and epidemiologic studies its cause is still unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed and according to experimental studies and clinical observation, fiber intake could play a role in its pathogenesis. The purpose of this case-control study was to examine the possible correlation of idiopathic chronic constipation in children and dietary intake, particularly fiber intake. A randomized sample of children (291 children with constipation and 1602 controls) aged 2 to 14 years was taken from three of the 52 counties of Greece. Stratification was performed on the basis of urban, rural, or suburban location and socioeconomic status. The nutritional data were obtained from a 3-day dietary record and a dietary history. Statistical analysis was performed with multivariate tests, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis, and chi-square analysis according to the characteristics of the correlated variables. Constipated children had a lower caloric and nutrient intake (p < 0.001), lower body weight/height (p < 0.001), and higher prevalence of reported anorexia (p < 0.001). Discriminant analysis indicated that dietary fiber alone was independently negatively correlated with chronic constipation, despite the age and the age of onset of constipation. Relative risk also had a negative correlation with fiber intake (p < 0.001). Of the main fiber fractions only cellulose and pentose were independently correlated with chronic constipation. Lack of fiber may play an important role in the etiology of chronic idiopathic constipation in children.
Summary:","A case-control study evaluated 291 subjects with constipation and compared their diet with 1602 controls. Mean daily fiber intake was lower in the constipation group. Compared with fiber intake of more than 29 g/d, the relative risk was 8.0 for fiber intake of less than 12.4 g/d."

Query 1: First- or second-generation antihistamines: which are more effective at controlling pruritus?
Document 1: This review begins with a brief survey of the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of pruritus, and goes on to describe the etiology of the major allergic and nonallergic pruritic disorders. The etiology of pruritus often suggests the appropriate treatment. For example, urticaria, which is primarily mediated by histamine, is amenable to treatment with H1 antihistamines. Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines appear to be more effective than sedating antihistamines, perhaps because of better compliance. Other systemic pharmacologic options may be useful in nonhistamine-mediated disorders, for example, immunomodulators for inflammation-induced pruritus or opiate antagonists for atopic dermatitis. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as proper skin care, and physical modalities, such as phototherapy or acupuncture, may also be helpful.
Summary 1: One recent nonsystematic, narrative review of pruritic dermatoses concluded second-generation antihistamines appear to be more effective.

Query 2: How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis?
Document 2: While hay fever is a very common experience, its treatment in primary care setting has been little reported in controlled studies. This study sought to evaluate the patient's assessment of efficacy of an intranasal steroid spray (budesonide) alone or in combination with an antihistamine (terfenadine) against terfenadine alone or placebo alone. A double-blind parallel group, placebo-controlled trial design was used, comparing the four groups. Each group used an active or placebo spray and active or placebo tablets. Symptom scores were recorded daily in diaries over a 21-day period. Overall assessment of efficacy by the 106 patients was significantly greater (P < .05) for budesonide versus terfenadine or placebo alone. There was a 40% placebo response. Budesonide was more effective than terfenadine for all individual symptom scores, particularly nasal blockage, against which terfenadine was ineffective. Adverse effects were mild and transient for all groups. Budesonide alone is a highly effective treatment for hay fever with few side effects.
Summary 2: In an randomized controlled trials of 106 patients, budesonide nasal spray's efficacy was tested against terfenadine alone and in combination; the nasal steroid alone was more effective than the histamine. Combining the 2 drugs yielded no significant improvements.

Query: First- or second-generation antihistamines: which are more effective at controlling pruritus?
Document: To compare the safety and efficacy of cetirizine with that of hydroxyzine and placebo in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. A 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study. Patients were treated in a variety of allergy practice settings. The study population consisted of 188 patients who were at least 12 years of age, with symptomatic chronic idiopathic urticaria that had occurred episodically for at least 6 weeks. Patients were given either cetirizine 10 mg once daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg tid, or placebo for 4 weeks. Patients and investigators used a 4-point scale to evaluate symptoms of urticaria and adverse effects of treatment. Ratings were compared among those taking cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or placebo. After 1 day of treatment, patients randomized to receive cetirizine 10 mg/d exhibited a reduction in the number of episodes of urticaria (and a reduction in pruritus) compared with patients who received hydroxyzine 25 mg tid and patients who received placebo (p = 0.002). The number of urticarial episodes in patients treated with hydroxyzine did not reach significance until day 2 (p = 0.001). Compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received cetirizine and those who received hydroxyzine showed reductions during weeks 1, 2, and 3 and at end-point analysis in the number and size of lesions and in the severity of pruritus (p < 0.04). Patient and physician evaluations at the end of week 4 revealed an improvement in urticarial symptoms for the hydroxyzine and cetirizine groups compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the hydroxyzine group, 1 patient in the cetirizine group, and 1 patient in the placebo group discontinued the study because of sedation. No patient withdrew because of lack of efficacy. Cetirizine 10 mg once daily was equivalent to hydroxyzine 25 mg tid in controlling the symptoms of patients with chronic urticaria, as assessed by patient and investigator evaluations.
Summary:","In a single double-blind placebo-controlled study of 188 patients at least 12 years of age, they received cetirizine 10 mg daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. This study found both agents produced significant, and equivalent, pruritus reduction relative to placebo."

Query 1: Do statins reduce the risk of stroke?
Document 1: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
Summary 1: The Heart Protection Study showed no difference in the number of hemorrhagic strokes between treatment and placebo groups. There were 3500 subjects with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dL; lowering low density lipoprotein to 65 mg/dL reduced major vascular event risk by about 25%.

Query 2: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 2: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 2: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
Summary:","The Heart Protection Study used simvastatin 40 mg daily, without titration. The Heart Protection Study enrolled 20,000 people with CAD or equivalent (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, etc). The study demonstrated a reduction of major coronary events with simvastatin, with numbers needed to treat (NNT) of 19 (P <.0001); the NNT for reduction in all-cause mortality was 55 (P =.0003). The benefit of simvastatin was noted in virtually every predefined subgroup, including individuals older than 70 years, women, and patients without known CAD (but with CAD equivalents). Notably, no difference in benefit was found between patients with different pretreatment LDL levels. A significant reduction in major vascular events was noted even for the 3400 subjects with pretreatment LDL levels of less than 100 mg/dL (NNT = 22, P =.0006). A greater percentage reduction in LDL with medication did not predict better clinical outcomes."

Query 1: Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer?
Document 1: To evaluate the accuracy of conventional and new methods of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing when used to detect cervical cancer and its precursors. Systematic search of English-language literature through October 1999 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, and hand searching. All studies that compared Pap testing (conventional methods, computer screening or rescreening, or monolayer cytology) with a concurrent reference standard (histologic examination, colposcopy, or cytology). Two reviewers independently reviewed selection criteria and completed 2 x 2 tables for each study. 94 studies of the conventional Pap test and three studies of monolayer cytology met inclusion criteria. No studies of computerized screening were included. Data were organized by cytologic and histologic thresholds used to define disease. For conventional Pap tests, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied greatly in individual studies. Methodologic quality and frequency of histologic abnormalities also varied greatly between studies. In the 12 studies with the least biased estimates, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 87% and specificity ranged from 86% to 100%. Insufficient high-quality data exist to estimate test operating characteristics of new cytologic methods for cervical screening. Future studies of these technologies should apply adequate reference standards. Most studies of the conventional Pap test are severely biased: The best estimates suggest that it is only moderately accurate and does not achieve concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. Cost-effectiveness models of cervical cancer screening should use more conservative estimates of Pap test sensitivity.
Summary 1: A review found insufficient evidence to even judge the new test.

Query 2: Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer?
Document 2: The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of ThinPrep, a liquid-based cytology preparation technique, in comparison with conventionally prepared Papanicolaou smears in detecting cervical pathology. Forty-seven English-language articles published between January 1990 and September 2002 were identified through Medline and manual searches. After elimination of 5 nonprimary articles, 10 unpaired studies, 5 descriptive articles with insufficient or no data, and 3 articles with data that could not be recast into a consistent format, there remained 24 usable articles. Seventeen articles contained data comparing ThinPrep with conventional cytology for 35172 patients; and 10 articles compared cytology with histology or other gold standard diagnoses for 21752 patients. Three of these articles contained both types of comparisons. The standard cytology classification into negative, atypical, low-grade (LGSIL) and high-grade (HGSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions, and carcinoma was applied; other categorization schemes were recoded as necessary. Concordance estimates, based on five-way and dichotomous (normal/abnormal) classifications, were obtained from the 17 studies containing paired cytology data. Sensitivity and specificity rates were obtained from the 10 studies with paired cytology and histology data. The two methods tend to agree in 89 and 92% of cases based on the five-level and dichotomous classifications, respectively. ThinPrep was reported as normal in 93.5% of cases of normal conventional smears. The remaining 6.5% of ThinPrep slides were classified as follows: atypical, 4.55%; LGSIL, 1.56%; HGSIL, 0.36%; invasive cancer, 0.007%. Sensitivity rates, relative to histology, were 68% (conventional) and 76% (ThinPrep), and specificity rates were 79% (conventional) and 86% (ThinPrep). ThinPrep tends to be more sensitive and specific than conventional smears in detecting cervical dysplasia. The increased sensitivity of ThinPrep results in increased cytologic diagnosis of cervical atypia, LGSIL, HGSIL, and invasive cervical carcinoma.
Summary 2: A recent quantitative review implies that the ThinPrep increases cytologic diagnoses of cervical cancer and its precursors. A strength of this review is the inclusion of 10 articles with histology as the reference standard. The data from 21,752 patients compared the sensitivity and specificity rates of Thin Prep with conventional Pap for detecting abnormal histology. Sensitivity rates were reported as 76% (ThinPrep) and 68% (conventional), but the differences met statistical significance in only 2 of the included studies. Similarly, the overall specificity rates of the ThinPrep vs conventional Pap was 86% vs 79%, and again the differences did not usually reach statistical significance. The authors hypothesize that widespread use of ThinPrep could potentially detect an additional 162,000 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 3000 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma.

Query: Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer?
Document: We sought to evaluate the cytologic diagnosis and sample adequacy of the liquid-based cervical cytologic smear (ThinPrep) compared with that of the conventional Papanicolaou smear. Prospective studies of ThinPrep and conventional Papanicolaou smears were analyzed for cytologic diagnosis and sample adequacy. Computerized databases, references in published studies, and index reviews published in English were used to identify direct-to-vial and split-sample clinical trials of cervical smears performed by conventional and liquid-based techniques. Only published studies that used the Bethesda system nomenclature with clearly documented outcome data were included. Each trial was assessed for the quality of its method, inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequacy of randomization, sampling protocols, definition of outcome, and statistical analyses. Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome. Estimates of odds ratios and risk differences for dichotomous outcomes were calculated by use of random and fixed-effects models. Homogeneity was tested across the studies. Results indicate that the ThinPrep test is as good as or superior to the conventional Papanicolaou smear in diagnosing uterine cervical premalignant abnormalities. Also the ThinPrep test provides improved sample adequacy when compared with the conventional Papanicolaou test. The ThinPrep test improved sample adequacy and led to improved diagnosis of low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. However, there is no difference in the rate of atypical cells of undetermined significance diagnosis between ThinPrep and conventional smear groups. The added cost of ThinPrep cytologic screening and, hence, its cost-effectiveness are not evaluated in this study.
Summary:","A large meta-analysis of 25 prospective studies including over 500,000 women reported that ThinPrep increased detection of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (odds ratio [OR]=2.15; 95% CI, 2.05-2.26) and HSIL (OR=2.26; 95% CI, 1.53-1.76), but the conclusions were severely limited by lack of a reference standard and high heterogeneity between study populations."

Query 1: Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms?
Document 1: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a major cause of cerebrovascular disease-related death. This problem could be eliminated by diagnosis and successful treatment of aneurysms before rupture. Recent developments in high-resolution imaging technology have made screening for unruptured aneurysms possible in the general population. Such screening has become widespread in Japan (""No Dokku, "" or brain checkup). As a result, unruptured aneurysms are being identified with increasing frequency. However, the economic implications of treatment decisions for unruptured aneurysms have not been analyzed. Therefore, we performed such an analysis. We used a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The model involved a set of variables describing discrete health states. Each state was assigned a quality of life score and an associated medical cost. A comparison of the expected outcomes was then made between 2 hypothetical cohorts, one receiving screening and the other no screening. A sensitivity analysis was performed by altering the input values within clinically reasonable ranges to reflect uncertainty in the baseline analysis and then assessing the effects on outcomes. Combining the incremental cost and effectiveness data revealed a cost per quality-adjusted life-year of $7760 for an annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms (rupture rate) of 0.02; this cost was $39 450 for a rupture rate of 0.01. There was no benefit (negative quality-adjusted life-year benefit) for a rupture rate of 0.005, the rupture rate found in a recently published international cooperative study. The risks of surgery for unruptured aneurysms and the discounting ratio used to assess the impact of timing of costs and benefits on future outcomes also had significant effects on the results. Other variables had little impact on cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of screening for an unruptured aneurysm is highly sensitive to the annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms. The low annual rupture rate seen in the recent large international cooperative study implies that screening asymptomatic populations to identify and treat unruptured aneurysms would not be cost cost-effective.
Summary 1: A mathematical model for evaluating cost effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms in the general population determined there is a quality-adjusted life-year reduction for presumed islet cell antibodies prevalence rates as high as 10%, given an annual rate of rupture of 0.05%. The average cost was $1121 for those who underwent screening vs $147 for those who did not. The presumed variables of prevalence, annual rates of islet cell antibodies rupture, and surgical mortality and morbidity greatly influenced cost-effectiveness. Screening could be reasonable in populations with higher rupture rates, and if surgical morbidity and mortality decline.

Query 2: Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms?
Document 2: Family screening programs for intracranial aneurysms have been considered but there are concerns about raised anxiety and depression, inadequate risk perception, and the principle of informed choice. Observational study in 980 first-degree relatives of 172 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. After being informed, consenting subjects completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), answered standardized questions on perceived risk, and responded to a list of statements about the decision-making process. 166 subjects (21%) declined the screening offer. 12% of the participants reported HADS anxiety scores in the moderate to severe range; 2% did so for feelings of depression. All relatives substantially underestimated the risk of harboring an aneurysm and of aneurysm rupture. 98% of the participants (96% of non-participants, P = 0.60) reported feeling free to make a choice, while 31% of the participants (42% of non-participants, P = 0.16) felt more or less compelled to participate in the screening program. The invitation to a family screening program for intracranial aneurysms does not lead to increased feelings of anxiety or depression. The unrealistic risk perception stresses the need of clear and detailed information. Attention should be given to factors that may interfere with the principle of informed choice.
Summary 2: An observational study of 980 first-degree relatives of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage determined that offering screening for islet cell antibodies did not provoke anxiety or depression.

Query: Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms?
Document: The purpose of this study was to establish whether individuals with a family history of >/=2 first-degree relatives with intracranial aneurysm should be offered screening for aneurysm. We derived 3 theoretical models and calculated the outcomes of screening with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) followed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) if MRA was positive (model 1), screening with DSA alone (model 2), and not screening (model 3). Screening was repeated at intervals of 10 years, and aneurysms detected were treated surgically. We assumed a prevalence of aneurysm of 9.8% (95% CI, 8.9% to 10.6%) in the population screened, an annual rupture rate of asymptomatic aneurysm of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4% to 1.5%), and a 75% chance of poor outcome from rupture. We assumed the sensitivity and specificity of MRA were each 90% and the risk of DSA was 0.1%. The risk of surgery was taken as 5.1%. Screening 1000 individuals on 3 occasions with MRA and DSA or with DSA alone followed by surgery resulted in poor outcome in 14 and 18 individuals, respectively, over 30 years. Without screening, poor outcome occurred in 15 individuals over the same period of time. Screening is not an effective way of reducing morbidity and mortality from ruptured intracranial aneurysm in individuals with a history of >/=2 affected first-degree relatives with ruptured intracranial aneurysm unless the expected incidence of asymptomatic aneurysm is considerably >10%.
Summary:","In a study of MRA with digital subtraction angiography backup, conducted using theoretical models, screening individuals having 2 or more first-degree relatives with aneurysm would result in severe morbidity or death in 26 individuals per 1000 patients screened, vs 15 per 1000 unscreened individuals over a 30-year period. These results were achieved assuming an ICA prevalence estimate of 9.8%, as determined from an earlier population study of individuals with at least 2 first-degree relatives with ICA. The lower ICA prevalence rate of 4% for patients with only 1 primary affected relative would yield an even more favorable result for not screening."

Query 1: What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL?
Document 1: The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis that compares the reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with high-dose statin therapy versus standard dosing. Debate exists regarding the merit of more intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy as compared with standard-dose therapy. We searched PubMed and article references for randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard-dose statin therapy enrolling more than 1,000 patients with either stable coronary heart disease or acute coronary syndromes. Four trials were identified: the TNT (Treating to New Targets) and the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering) trials involved patients with stable cardiovascular disease, and the PROVE IT-TIMI-22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-22) and A-to-Z (Aggrastat-to-Zocor) trials involved patients with acute coronary syndromes. We carried out a meta-analysis of the relative odds on the basis of a fixed-effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method for the major outcomes of death and cardiovascular events. A total of 27,548 patients were enrolled in the 4 large trials. The combined analysis yielded a significant 16% odds reduction in coronary death or myocardial infarction (p < 0.00001), as well as a significant 16% odds reduction of coronary death or any cardiovascular event (p < 0.00001). No difference was observed in total or non-cardiovascular mortality, but a trend toward decreased cardiovascular mortality (odds reduction 12%, p = 0.054) was observed. Intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy provides a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly non-fatal cardiovascular events.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis concluded that intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy confers a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly nonfatal cardiovascular events.

Query 2: What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia?
Document 2: Ezetimibe is the first of a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents, the cholesterol-absorption inhibitors. It is indicated for monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, in combination with simvastatin or atorvastatin in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and as monotherapy in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia. This article reviews available data on the clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe. A literature review was conducted using the search terms ezetimibe and SCH 58235 to identify articles and abstracts indexed in MEDLINE and the Iowa Drug Information Service from 1966 to February 2003. The reference lists of the identified articles were reviewed for additional publications. In adults, ezetimibe 10 mg PO given once daily has been reported to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54% from baseline in association with a compensatory increase in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Within 2 weeks of its initiation, ezetimibe monotherapy produced a 17% to 20% reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in combination with statins, ezetimibe produced a reduction in LDL-C of up to 40% over the same period. Based on studies performed to date, ezetimibe appears to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Because ezetimibe is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation and not by cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidation, it is subject to minimal drug interactions involving the CYP enzyme system. Ezetimibe is an option for monotherapy in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia or in those requiring adjunctive drug therapy for reduction of LDL-C levels. It may be useful in patients at risk for adverse events (eg, liver toxicity, myopathy) from other hypocholesterolemic agents. Additive LDL-C-lowering effects of ezetimibe may allow use of lower doses of conventional agents (eg, statins, fibric acid derivatives, niacin) to achieve an equivalent effect, thereby reducing the potential for adverse events and drug interactions. However, because trials have lasted no longer than 12 weeks, the long-term effect of ezetimibe on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be determined.
Summary 2: Statin/ezetimibe combination therapy is FDA-approved, and provides an additional 12% to 21% absolute low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction.

Query: What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia?
Document: To develop an optimal treatment strategy that reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and improves adherence to therapy by reviewing clinical trials that define the dose-response characteristics for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), bile acid sequestrants, and niacin. Data were obtained from a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature published from 1975 through November 1995 and from an extensive bibliography review. Controlled, clinical trials were reviewed if they evaluated 1) the effectiveness and toxicity of one LDL cholesterol-lowering agent (statins, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, at two or more doses) or 2) monotherapy with two LDL cholesterol-lowering agents at defined doses used alone and in combination. Studies that had fewer than 10 patients in a treatment group or that selected patients on the basis of previous response to therapy were not included. Trials were reviewed for overall methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sources of bias, and outcomes. Dose-response relations for bile acid sequestrants and statins are nonlinear, and most of their LDL cholesterol-lowering effects can be obtained with lower doses. The few dose-response studies of niacin that have been done suggest that most of niacin's high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-increasing effect can also be achieved with relatively low doses, but higher doses are needed to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol levels. If bile acid sequestrants or niacin are added to statin therapy, the effect of combined therapy on LDL cholesterol levels is additive. The nonlinear dose-response relation of statins, bile acid sequestrants, and niacin and their additive LDL cholesterol-lowering effect when used together suggest a strategy for treating hypercholesterolemia that may optimize effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects and cost.
Summary:",A systematic review found that adding colestipol or cholestyramine to a statin provides an additional 7% to 20% absolute LDL cholesterol reduction.

Query 1: Do statins cause myopathy?
Document 1: To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.
Summary 1: A tabular analysis of 74 published case reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis from a MEDLINE search covering 1985 to 2000 reported that in most cases the statin was safely restarted after stopping presumed interactive drugs (exact numbers not reported).

Query: What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia?
Document: Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed. To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed. Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.
Summary:","In an analysis of 36 controlled clinical trials (1674 patients) that evaluated statin-fibrate combinations, 0.12% of patients developed myopathy, but none developed rhabdomyolysis or kidney failure."

Query 1: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document 1: Many randomised trials assessing the effect of salt reduction on blood pressure show reduction in blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure. However, there is controversy about the magnitude and the clinical significance of the fall in blood pressure in individuals with normal blood pressure. Several meta-analyses of randomised salt reduction trials have been published in the last few years. However, most of these included trials of very short duration (e.g. 5 days) and included trials with salt loading followed by salt deprivation (e.g. from 20 to 1 g/day) over only a few days. These short-term experiments are not appropriate to inform public health policy which is for a modest reduction in salt intake over a prolonged period of time. A meta-analysis by Hooper et al is an important attempt to look at whether advice to achieve a long-term salt reduction (i.e. more than 6 months) in randomised trials causes a fall in blood pressure. However, most trials included in this meta-analysis achieved a small reduction in salt intake; on average, salt intake was reduced by 2 g/day. It is, therefore, not surprising that this analysis showed a small fall in blood pressure, and that a dose-response to salt reduction was not demonstrable. To assess the effect of the currently recommended modest reduction in salt intake (WHO 2003; SACN 2003; Whelton 2002), on blood pressure in individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. To assess whether the magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure is dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in salt intake. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, and reference list of original and review articles. We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and a duration of 4 or more weeks. Data were extracted independently by two persons. Mean effect sizes were calculated using both fixed and random effect models using Review Manager 4.2.1 software. Weighted linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the change in urinary sodium and the change in blood pressure. We used funnel plots to detect publication and other biases in the meta-analysis. Seventeen trials in individuals with elevated blood pressure (n=734) and 11 trials in individuals with normal blood pressure (n=2220) were included. In individuals with elevated blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 78 mmol (4.6 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -4.97 mmHg (95%CI:-5.76 to -4.18), and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -2.74 mmHg (95% CI:-3.22 to -2.26). In individuals with normal blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 74 mmol (4.4 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -2.03 mmHg (95% CI: -2.56 to -1.50) mmHg, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -0.99 mmHg (-1.40 to -0.57). Weighted linear regression analyses showed a correlation between the reduction in urinary sodium and the reduction in blood pressure. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake for a duration of 4 or more weeks has a significant and, from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in both individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. These results support other evidence suggesting that a modest and long-term reduction in population salt intake could reduce strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure. Furthermore, our meta-analysis demonstrates a correlation between the magnitude of salt reduction and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Within the daily intake range of 3 to 12 g/day, the lower the salt intake achieved, the lower the blood pressure.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review of 17 trials with 734 participants concluded that for individuals with hypertension, a reduced-salt diet results in a mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 5 mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, respectively.

Query 2: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document 2: Physical activity has been associated with reduced blood pressure in observational epidemiologic studies and individual clinical trials. This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials was conducted to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on blood pressure. English-language articles published before September 2001. 54 randomized, controlled trials (2419 participants) whose intervention and control groups differed only in aerobic exercise. Using a standardized protocol and data extraction form, three of the investigators independently abstracted data on study design, sample size, participant characteristics, type of intervention, follow-up duration, and treatment outcomes. In a random-effects model, data from each trial were pooled and weighted by the inverse of the total variance. Aerobic exercise was associated with a significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-3.84 mm Hg [95% CI, -4.97 to -2.72 mm Hg] and -2.58 mm Hg [CI, -3.35 to -1.81 mm Hg], respectively). A reduction in blood pressure was associated with aerobic exercise in hypertensive participants and normotensive participants and in overweight participants and normal-weight participants. Aerobic exercise reduces blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive persons. An increase in aerobic physical activity should be considered an important component of lifestyle modification for prevention and treatment of high blood pressure.
Summary 2: A well-done systematic review and meta-analysis from 2002 (including 15 studies with 770 participants) concluded that for hypertensive patients, aerobic exercise with at least one 40-minute session of moderate intensity per week is associated with a drop in systolic blood pressure of about 5 mm Hg and a drop in diastolic blood pressure of about 4 mm Hg.

Query: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document: Alcohol drinking has been associated with increased blood pressure in epidemiological studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of alcohol reduction on blood pressure. We included 15 randomized control trials (total of 2234 participants) published before June 1999 in which alcohol reduction was the only intervention difference between active and control treatment groups. Using a standard protocol, information on sample size, participant characteristics, study design, intervention methods, duration, and treatment results was abstracted independently by 3 investigators. By means of a fixed-effects model, findings from individual trials were pooled after results for each trial were weighted by the inverse of its variance. Overall, alcohol reduction was associated with a significant reduction in mean (95% confidence interval) systolic and diastolic blood pressures of -3.31 mm Hg (-2.52 to -4.10 mm Hg) and -2.04 mm Hg (-1.49 to -2.58 mm Hg), respectively. A dose-response relationship was observed between mean percentage of alcohol reduction and mean blood pressure reduction. Effects of intervention were enhanced in those with higher baseline blood pressure. Our study suggests that alcohol reduction should be recommended as an important component of lifestyle modification for the prevention and treatment of hypertension among heavy drinkers.
Summary:","A well-done meta-analysis of alcohol reduction and blood pressure included 7 studies with 415 hypertensive patients. Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 3 to 6 alcoholic drinks per day, and the mean reduction in consumption was 67%. For this patient population, the average improvement was almost 4 mm Hg for SBP and nearly 2.5 mm Hg for DBP."

Query 1: What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans?
Document 1: The effect of dietary composition on blood pressure is a subject of public health importance. We studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium, in conjunction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products, in persons with and in those without hypertension. A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet typical of intake in the United States or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high, intermediate, and low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in random order. Reducing the sodium intake from the high to the intermediate level reduced the systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mm Hg (P<0.001) during the control diet and by 1.3 mm Hg (P=0.03) during the DASH diet. Reducing the sodium intake from the intermediate to the low level caused additional reductions of 4.6 mm Hg during the control diet (P<0.001) and 1.7 mm Hg during the DASH diet (P<0.01). The effects of sodium were observed in participants with and in those without hypertension, blacks and those of other races, and women and men. The DASH diet was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level; and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones. As compared with the control diet with a high sodium level, the DASH diet with a low sodium level led to a mean systolic blood pressure that was 7.1 mm Hg lower in participants without hypertension, and 11.5 mm Hg lower in participants with hypertension. The reduction of sodium intake to levels below the current recommendation of 100 mmol per day and the DASH diet both lower blood pressure substantially, with greater effects in combination than singly. Long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of people to make long-lasting dietary changes and the increased availability of lower-sodium foods.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium in conjunction with the DASH diet. A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high (150 mmol/d), intermediate (100 mmol/d), and low (50 mmol/d) levels of sodium in random order. In this study, low-sodium DASH diet was associated with additional lowering of blood pressure, an effect that was also found to be stronger for African Americans patients than others. When compared with the combination of the control diet and a high level of sodium, the DASH diet and a low level of sodium lowered systolic blood pressure by 11.5 mm Hg for participants with hypertension (12.6 mm Hg for blacks; 9.5 mm Hg for others), and by 7.1 mm Hg for participants without hypertension (7.2 mm Hg for blacks; 6.9 mm Hg for others).

Document 2: Evaluate whether weight-loss diets are more effective than regular diets or other antihypertensive therapies in controlling blood pressure and preventing morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults. MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched through November 1997. Trials known to experts in the field were included through June 1998. For inclusion in the review, trials were required to meet each of the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials with one group assigned to a weight-loss diet and the other group assigned to either normal diet or antihypertensive therapy; 2) ambulatory adults with a mean blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic; 3) active intervention consisting of a calorie-restricted diet intended to produce weight loss (excluded studies simultaneously implementing multiple lifestyle interventions where the effects of weight loss could not be disaggregated); and 4) outcome measures included weight loss and blood pressure. Studies were dual abstracted by two independent reviewers using a standardized form designed specifically for this review. The primary mode of analysis was qualitative; graphs of effect sizes for individual studies were also used. Eighteen trials were found. Only one small study of inadequate power reported morbidity and mortality outcomes. None addressed quality of life or general well being issues. In general, participants assigned to weight-reduction groups lost weight compared to control groups. Six trials involving 361 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus a normal diet. The data suggested weight loss in the range of 4% to 8% of body weight was associated with a decrease in blood pressure in the range of 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Three trials involving 363 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus treatment with antihypertensive medications. These suggested that a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications produced greater decreases in blood pressure (in the range of 6/5 mm Hg systolic/diastolic) than did a weight-loss diet. Trials that allowed adjustment of participants' antihypertensive regimens suggested that patients required less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy if they followed a weight-reducing diet. Data was insufficient to determine the relative efficacy of weight-reduction versus changes in sodium or potassium intake or exercise. Weight-reducing diets in overweight hypertensive persons can affect modest weight loss in the range of 3-9% of body weight and are probably associated with modest blood pressure decreases of roughly 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Weight-reducing diets may decrease dosage requirements of persons taking antihypertensive medications.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review of 18 trials with 2611 participants concluded that for overweight hypertensive patients, weight loss of 3% to 9% of body weight is associated with 3 mm Hg decreases in both systolic blood pressure and DBP.

Query: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document: It is known that obesity, sodium intake, and alcohol consumption factors influence blood pressure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a ""combination"" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels. At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3+/-10.8 mm Hg and 84.7+/-4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07). Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pressure, > or =140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, > or =90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hypertension, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003). A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. This diet offers an additional nutritional approach to preventing and treating hypertension.
Summary:","In a high-quality RCT, the DASH diet lowered SBP for hypertensive patients by an average of 11 mm Hg and DBP by an average of 5.5 mm Hg compared with the control group. Participants were provided with all food during the entire 8-week length of the trial."

Query 1: What precautions should we use with statins for women of childbearing age?
Document 1: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, normally cycling women (n = 86) with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were studied over six menstrual cycles. At the end of the screening phase, participants received placebo for the second menstrual cycle and subsequently were randomized to receive either placebo or simvastatin (40 mg/d) for the next four cycles. The second and sixth menstrual cycles were considered baseline and treatment cycles, respectively. Participants kept a menstrual diary throughout the study and provided daily first-void urine samples during cycles 2 and 6. Urine samples were assayed for LH and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG). The primary end point was change in luteal phase duration as defined by the day of the urinary LH peak to the day preceding the onset of menstruation. Treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/d) effectively lowered LDL-C by 34.3% (P < 0.001). Simvastatin was generally well tolerated, and no meaningful difference in adverse event profile was observed between treatment groups. Compared with the placebo group, simvastatin did not have clinically relevant effects on luteal phase duration, peak PdG concentration, or integrated luteal phase PdG concentration. The results of this study demonstrate that treatment of healthy premenopausal women for approximately 4 months with simvastatin (40 mg/d) lowers LDL-C without adversely affecting reproductive gonadal function. Simvastatin should not be used during pregnancy or by nursing mothers.
Summary 1: Highly lipophilic statins-such as simvastatin, atorvastatin (Lipitor), and lovastatin-achieve embryoplacental concentrations similar to those of maternal plasma. For this reason, if statin therapy is needed, these agents should be avoided. Pravastatin (Pravachol) is the most hydrophilic statin and has no reports of abnormal pregnancy outcomes, even in animal research.

Document 2: Several clinical trials have evaluated the effects of lipid-lowering medications on coronary heart disease (CHD). Many of the trials have not included enough women to allow sex-specific analyses or have not reported results in women separately. To assess and synthesize the evidence regarding drug treatment of hyperlipidemia for the prevention of CHD events in women and to conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of drug treatment on mortality. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness for articles published from 1966 through December 2003. We reviewed reference lists of articles and consulted content experts. Studies of outpatients that had a treatment duration of at least 1 year, assessed the impact of lipid lowering on clinical outcomes, and reported results by sex were included. Outcomes evaluated were total mortality, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, and total CHD events. Summary estimates of the relative risks (RRs) with therapy were calculated using a random-effects model for patients with and without a previous history of cardiovascular disease. Thirteen studies were included. Six trials included a total of 11 435 women without cardiovascular disease and assessed the effects of lipid-lowering medications. Lipid lowering did not reduce total mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.46), CHD mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.47-2.40), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.22-1.68), revascularization (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.33-2.31), or CHD events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.69-1.09). However, some analyses were limited by too few CHD events in the available trials. Eight trials included 8272 women with cardiovascular disease and assessed the effects of lipid-lowering medications. Lipid lowering did not reduce total mortality in women with cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.77-1.29). However, lipid lowering reduced CHD mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-1.00), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), revascularization (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89), and total CHD events (RR, 0.80; CI, 0.71-0.91). For women without cardiovascular disease, lipid lowering does not affect total or CHD mortality. Lipid lowering may reduce CHD events, but current evidence is insufficient to determine this conclusively. For women with known cardiovascular disease, treatment of hyperlipidemia is effective in reducing CHD events, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization, but it does not affect total mortality.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis evaluated the benefits of lipid-lowering medication in trials of at least 1 year duration that included women. Total and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, and total coronary heart disease events were assessed among women with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ten trials included statins. Of the 5 studies that reported age, the average was 61 years. For women without CVD, lipid-lowering treatment was not shown to affect total or coronary heart disease mortality. For women with known CVD, hyperlipidemia treatment did not affect total mortality, but was shown effective in reducing coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization; the relative risk of coronary heart disease events for statin users was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.91). The number of women needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an initial coronary heart disease event was 140. For secondary prevention, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 coronary heart disease event was 26. Since women of child-bearing potential have lower probability of coronary heart disease events compared to the older women studied in this meta-analysis, the expected benefit for younger women is likely to be substantially lower.

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 86 normally cycling women. Mean age of women completing the study was 35. Simvastatin 40 mg/d was studied for cholesterol effects and female reproductive effects. Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) and pregnanediol glucuronide (PDG), a progesterone metabolite, were assessed to determine if treatment with simvastatin adversely affects luteal function. Simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 34.3% (P<.001). Normal luteal phase duration and peak were confirmed by urinary PDG and LH levels. This study demonstrated that treatment with simvastatin for 4 months had no significant clinical changes on reproductive gonadal function compared with placebo."

Query 1: When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia?
Document 1: There is now ample evidence to demonstrate that atherosclerosis begins in childhood and is significantly accelerated in certain genetic disorders, most notably familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Untreated FH, both the homozygous and heterozygous forms, carry a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality if left untreated or inadequately treated. Males with FH are at earlier and greater risk than females and thus should begin therapy earlier, preferably at about 10. While bile acid sequestrants have long been considered the drug of choice in children, they have never been approved for pediatric use by FDA, are poorly tolerated, marginally effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and have minimal well controlled studies in children upon which to adequately assess safety. Over the last decade statins have been studied extensively in children and adolescents, although many of these studies have also been poorly controlled, of short duration, too small and lack detailed assessment. However there has been at least one large, randomized, placebo-controlled and comprehensive study with lovastatin in adolescent males that indicated efficacy similar to that anticipated in adults and no apparent safety concerns. While additional well-controlled studies are needed, especially those focusing on surrogates of atherosclerosis to determine clinical benefit, it is opportune for re-evaluation of current treatment guidelines.
Summary 1: Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 500, are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood. One quarter of males with familial hyper-cholesterolemia suffer fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) by age 50 years.

Query 2: When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia?
Document 2: The recommended therapy of hypercholesterolemia in children consists of dietary modification and bile acid-binding resins. Unfortunately, the lipid-lowering efficacy of bile acid-binding resins is modest, and moreover, long-term compliance is poor because of side effects. In contrast, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in adults and are considered to be the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in that age category. In the last few years, several randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of statin therapy in both children and adolescents. In this article, we review statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic children in terms of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and psychosocial functioning. Statins are not only effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in children with familial hypercholesterolemia but also improve endothelial function and reduce the progressive thickening of the intima media complex of the carotid arteries. Statins seem safe at the longer term in children in terms of plasma levels of liver enzymes and liver function, creatine kinase levels, and muscle function, as well as growth and sexual development. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether statin treatment started early in children with familial hypercholesterolemia can prevent future cardiovascular events.
Summary 2: The use of statins by children with familial hypercholesterolemia for up to 2 years is safe and lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Longer use by children has not been studied, so no comment can be made about long-term safety and decreased coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality.

Query: When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia?
Document: In the majority of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) the disorder is caused by a mutation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene that impairs its proper function, resulting in very high levels of plasma cholesterol. Such levels result in early and severe atherosclerosis, and hence substantial excess mortality from coronary heart disease. Most people with FH are undiagnosed or only diagnosed after their first coronary event, but early detection and treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can reduce morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of FH in the UK population is estimated to be 1 in 500, which means that approximately 110,000 people are affected. To evaluate whether screening for FH is appropriate. To determine which system of screening is most acceptable and cost-effective. To assess the deleterious psychosocial effects of genetic and clinical screening for an asymptomatic treatable inherited condition. To assess whether the risks of screening outweigh potential benefits.  Relevant papers were identified through a search of the electronic databases. Additional papers referenced in the search material were identified and collected. Known researchers in the field were contacted and asked to supply information on unpublished or ongoing studies. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: SCREENING AND TREATMENT: The review included studies of the mortality and morbidity associated with FH, the effectiveness and cost of treatment (ignoring pre-statin therapies in adults), and of the effectiveness or cost of possible screening strategies for FH. PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS OF SCREENING: The search for papers on the psychological and social effects of screening for a treatable inherited condition was limited to the last 5 years because recent developments in genetic testing have changed the nature and implications of such screening tests. Papers focusing on genetic testing for FH and breast cancer were included. Papers relating to the risk of coronary heart disease with similarly modifiable outcome (non-FH) were also included. DATA EXTRACTION AND ASSESSMENT OF VALIDITY: A data assessment tool was designed to assess the quality and validity of the papers which reported primary data for the social and psychological effects of screening. Available guidelines for systematically reviewing papers concentrated on quantitative methods, and were of limited relevance. An algorithm was developed which could be used for both the qualitative and quantitative literature. MODELLING METHODS: A model was constructed to investigate the relative cost and effectiveness of various forms of population screening (universal or opportunistic) and case-finding screening (screening relatives of known FH cases). All strategies involved a two-stage process: first, identifying those people with cholesterol levels sufficiently elevated to be compatible with a diagnosis of FH, and then either making the diagnosis based on clinical signs and a family history of coronary disease or carrying out genetic tests. Cost-effectiveness has been measured in terms of incremental cost per year of life gained. MODELLING COST-EFFECTIVENESS: FH is a life-threatening condition with a long presymptomatic state. Diagnostic tests are reasonably reliable and acceptable, and treatment with statins substantially improves prognosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider systematic screening for this condition. Case finding amongst relatives of FH cases was the most cost-effective strategy, and universal systematic screening the least cost-effective. However, when targeted at young people (16 year olds) universal screening was also cost-effective. Screening patients admitted to hospital with premature myocardial infarction was also relatively cost-effective. Screening is least cost-effective in men aged over 35 years, because the gains in life expectancy are small. (ABSTRACT TRUNCA
Summary:","One systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of screening methods for familial hypercholesterolemia beginning at the age of 16 years. The authors identified potential screening strategies from 6 cross-sectional studies and applied these to a decision analysis. Screening of first-degree relatives of those with familial hypercholesterolemia was most effective in detecting cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (number needed to screen [NNS]=3; cost per case detected=$232; cost per life-year gained=$5397). Universal screening of all 16-year-olds was also cost-effective (cost per life-year gained=$4839), but resulted in a much larger NNS and cost of detection (NNS=1365, cost per case detected=$16,999). The authors concluded that case finding through screening of first-degree relatives was the most cost-effective strategy overall."

Query 1: When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia?
Document 1: PURPOSE: Both the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III) have issued recommendations on screening for dyslipidemia in adults. To guide the USPSTF in updating its 2001 recommendations, we reviewed evidence relevant to discrepancies between these recommendations. DATA SOURCES: A 2001 evidence review prepared for the USPSTF, supplemented by searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of recent systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between December 1999 and February 2005 that addressed screening in younger patients not at high risk; use of triglyceride levels in an initial screening panel; optimal screening intervals; selection of patients for treatment; and harms of drug therapy. DATA EXTRACTION: We abstracted data on the design, results, and quality of each included trial. We used standard USPSTF methods to rate the internal validity of trials and epidemiologic studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: New evidence relevant to discrepancies between USPSTF and ATP III recommendations was summarized in the context of earlier evidence. LIMITATIONS: This document should be read in conjunction with the full systematic evidence review conducted for the USPSTF in 2001, the final report of ATP III, and the 2004 ATP III update. CONCLUSIONS: There is no new evidence relevant to screening younger adults or to appropriate screening intervals. Evidence is conflicting regarding the additional contribution of a serum triglyceride level to the identification of individuals at short-term risk for coronary heart disease events. The balance of benefits and harms is clearly in favor of statin therapy among individuals enrolled in some, but not all, randomized trials of primary prevention. The long-term harms of statin therapy are unknown.
Summary 1: Screening for hyperlipidemia using total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is recommended for adults after the age of 35 years for men and 45 years for women. Younger adults (men aged 20-35 and women aged 20-45) should be screened for lipid disorders if they have other risk factors for CVD.

Document: The family basis of coronary heart disease is well recognized and it is important for family physicians to assess whether children have elevated cholesterol levels. We aimed to evaluate the advisability of implementing cholesterol screening in children with a family history of cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidaemia. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Taiwan from February to June 1996. There were 47,800 students in the population. A total of 4520 students were recruited by two-stage sampling. All the participants were required to fill out a structured questionnaire. The response rate was 92.5%. Our results show that 16-18% of the children had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease or hyperlipidaemia. Children with a family history of hyperlipidaemia were significantly more likely to have elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those without such a history (both odds ratios: 1.4, P < 0.05). Positive predictive values of hyperlipidaemia were less than 13% based on family history. More than 75% of children with abnormal lipid levels would be missed. The data suggest that parents' self-reported family history is an ineffective means of identifying children with elevated serum lipid levels in Taiwan. Further research and modification of current National Cholesterol Education Program Panel guidelines for selective cholesterol screening in children may be warranted.
Summary:","A study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate family history of premature cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia screening indicators in 4183 grade-school children in Taiwan. Family history performed poorly as a mechanism for identifying children with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >200 mg/dL; LDL >130 mg/dL) (PPV <12.5%7). More than 75% of the children in the Taiwan study would have been missed using family history as a screen. Study concluded that family history as a screening indicator is insensitive and inaccurate, and no more useful than general population screening."

Query 1: What is the best strategy for monitoring the lipid-lowering effects of medical therapy used for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease coronary artery disease?
Document 1: To assess the accuracy of lipid screening strategies to identify individuals at increased risk of coronary heart disease mortality. The 15% random sample of adults recruited into the Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence and Follow-up Studies, which included 3678 men and women aged 35 to 74 years. Total plasma cholesterol levels, lipoprotein fractions, and other coronary risk factors at study entry were compared with subsequent coronary heart disease mortality (mean follow-up, 12.2 years). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for blood lipids, lipid ratios, the screening guidelines proposed by the National National Cholesterol Education Program, those of the Canadian Consensus Conference on Cholesterol, and a coronary risk model that used Framingham data. The current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (area under the curve, 0.74) were significantly (P = .03) more accurate than the old National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (area, 0.72). The ratio of total plasma cholesterol level to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (area, 0.72) was as accurate as current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The coronary risk model (area, 0.85) was superior (P < .003) to all other screening maneuvers. Compared with the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, the risk model demonstrated superior test sensitivity (70% vs 45%) with only slightly reduced specificity (82% vs 86%). The ratio of total plasma cholesterol level to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is as accurate as current American screening guidelines. Future guidelines should better incorporate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and nonlipid risk factors to target high-risk individuals accurately.
Summary 1: Grover and colleagues found that the TC/HDL-C and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratios both performed better than the total cholesterol in predicting heart disease mortality.

Query 2: Does birth weight predict childhood obesity?
Document 2: To identify the risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. A nationwide case-control study in eight cities in China. A total of 748 boys and 574 girls (age 0.1 - 6.9 y), including the obese and non-obese. One obese child was matched with one non-obese child by sex and age. Weight, height and other measurements were taken for all the subjects. The information on child activity, feeding pattern and family background was collected by our study team from the parents and the kindergarten teacher. Birth weight > or =4.0 kg, high eating speed, obesity among the child's relatives > or =25%, mother's body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 and father's BMI > 25 kg/m2 were identified as the major significant (P < 0.05) risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. Family history of obesity, high birth weight and eating speed were identified as the risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. Our results show the need for family therapy as part of an intervention program for childhood obesity, which includes behavior modification.
Summary 2: A large Chinese population-based, case-control study (N=1322), found birth weight above 4.0 kg to be a risk factor for obesity in preschool-age children (OR=3.77; 95% CI, 2.06-6.29). The absolute rate of overweight increased from 8% to 26% among large-for-gestational-age infants.

Query: When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia?
Document: To determine the usefulness of parent history of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease as a screening criterion for hypercholesterolemia in youths. Data were available from a population-based survey of 3665 Quebec youths aged 9, 13, and 16 years (81.2% of eligible subjects). Blood specimens were collected from 2475 subjects (54.8% of those eligible), and questionnaire data were obtained from 3048 parents (67.5% of those eligible). Lipids were measured in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standardized laboratory. Usefulness of parent history in identifying borderline/high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (> or =2.8 mmol/L [> or =110 mg/dL]) and high LDL-C (> or =3.4 mmol/L [> or =130 mg/dL]) was assessed according to test performance statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value). The prevalence of a positive parent history was 25.6%; 18.3% of subjects had borderline/high LDL-C, and 4.8% had high LDL-C. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of parent history were 33.1%, 76.0%, 23.7%, and 83.5%, respectively, for identifying borderline/high LDL-C; they were 40.7%, 75.1%, 7.7%, and 96.1% for identifying high LDL-C. Test performance statistics were not improved in subgroups defined according to age, gender, parent education, household income, family status, and family origin (French Canadian, other); neither were they improved by adding screening criteria (parent history of diabetes or hypertension, or youth overweight). Parent history screening criteria offer little improvement over random population screening in identifying youths with hypercholesterolemia.
Summary:","A study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate family history of premature cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia screening indicators 2217 youths in Quebec. Family history performed poorly as a mechanism for identifying children with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >200 mg/dL; LDL >130 mg/dL) (PPV=7.7%). Study concluded that family history as a screening indicator is insensitive and inaccurate, and no more useful than general population screening."

Query 1: What are contraindications to IUDs?
Document 1: The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is highly effective and cost-effective. IUD use is limited in some regions, however, due to concerns about increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent complications such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Recent reviews suggest that the overall risk of PID with modern IUDs is lower than previously thought, at least in regions with a low prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Risk of PID may be higher, however, in places where gonorrhoea and chlamydia are prevalent, where screening for STIs is limited and where aseptic conditions for insertion are difficult to ensure. A World Health Organization multi-centre study and other studies have confirmed regional differences in STI prevalence, and the WHO study established that PID risk is temporally related to IUD insertion procedures. Studies of the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infectious complications are inconclusive due at least in part to use of sub-therapeutic regimens for pathogens commonly implicated in PID. In summary, the IUD can be safe and effective if inserted under aseptic conditions in women free of cervical infection. Further study is needed to define appropriate standards of care for IUD insertion where STI prevalence is high and ability to rule out infection is limited. Even with safe insertion, IUD promotion in areas of high STI/HIV prevalence must address women's needs for dual protection from infection and unwanted pregnancy.
Summary 1: In the US, approximately 1 in 1000 women develop pelvic inflammatory disease after IUD insertion.

Query: What are contraindications to IUDs?
Document: The influence of different contraceptive techniques on the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 672 patients with gonorrhoea have been studied. The lowest frequency of PID was found in patients using hormonal contraceptives (Group A), 8.8 per cent compared to 23.5 per cent in patients using intrauterine devices (Group B) and 15.1 per cent in patients using neither technique (Group C). In comparable control groups no significant differences in background factors, such as age, marital status and sexual activity were demonstrated. It is therefore concluded that the significantly lower incidence of PID in patients using hormonal contraceptives compared to the other groups and the high incidence of PID in patients using intrauterine devices is related to the contraceptive technique per se.
Summary:",IUD insertion does not increase the risk of PID for women with gonorrhea or chlamydia infection compared with infected nonusers.

Query 1: Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis?
Document 1: Prospective studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that infants unlikely to have serious bacterial infections (SBI) can be accurately identified by low risk criteria. Febrile infants (rectal T > or = 38 degrees C) < or = 60 days of age were considered at low risk for SBI if they met the following criteria: 1) appear well; 2) were previously healthy; 3) have no focal infection; 4) have WBC count 5.0-15.0 x 10(9) cells/L (5000-15,000/mm3), band form count < or = 1.5 x 10(9) cells/L (< or = 1500/mm3), < or = 10 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of spun urine sediment, and < or = 5 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of a stool smear (if diarrhea). The recommended evaluation included the culture of specimens of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine for bacteria. Outcomes were determined. The negative predictive values of the low risk criteria for SBI and bacteremia were calculated. Of 1057 eligible infants, 931 were well appearing, and, of these, 437 met the remaining low risk criteria. Five low risk infants had SBI including two infants with bacteremia. The negative predictive value of the low risk criteria was 98.9% (95% confidence interval, 97.2% to 99.6%) for SBI, and 99.5% (95% confidence interval, 98.2% to 99.9%) for bacteremia. These data confirm the ability of the low risk criteria to identify infants unlikely to have SBI. Infants who meet the low risk criteria can be carefully observed without administering antimicrobial agents.
Summary 1: The ""low-risk"" infants have a correspondingly lower incidence of serious bacterial infection: the negative predictive value of the Rochester classification is 98.9% 95% confidence interval [CI], 97.2-99.6%.

Query 2: Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis?
Document 2: Fever may be the sole clinically evident presentation of serious bacterial infection (SBI) in a very young infant, and therefore lumbar puncture is still widely regarded as a mandatory procedure in the sepsis workup of febrile infants under 2 months of age. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the frequency and the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid examination in 492 infants aged less than 3 months who were hospitalized because of fever during 1988-1994. The patients were categorized as being at ""high risk"" or ""low risk"" for SBI according to current clinical and laboratory criteria. Among the 492 infants, 196 (40%) were identified as ""high-risk"" for SBI, and 296 (60%) were at low risk. Among the overall series of infants, 60 babies (12%) were subsequently proven with bacterial infection. Among the 196 ""high-risk"" babies, 26% had bacterial infection, compared to only 3% of the 296 infants at low risk (p < 0.0001), denoting a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 65% of the clinical classification criteria. Lumbar puncture was done to 186 (46%) infants upon hospital admission; 176 punctures yielded satisfactory samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sixteen (3%) patients had abnormal CSF findings: 2 of them had positive bacterial cultures and 14 were compatible with aseptic meningitis. The 2 patients with purulent meningitis were clinically very ill and were immediately recognized as deserving a lumbar puncture. Of the 14 patients with aseptic meningitis, 13 were initially screened as being at high risk for serious infection, and therefore underwent a lumbar puncture. Over the years of this survey, a declining trend for performing lumbar puncture in ""low-risk"" young febrile infants became evident: during 1988-1992, evaluation of sepsis included a lumbar puncture in 45% of the infants, compared to 27% during the following 2 years (p < 0.0001). Not one instance of purulent meningitis evolved among the infants in whom lumbar puncture was not performed. Our observations suggest that hospitalized young febrile infants may safely be spared a lumbar puncture when they do not meet the proposed criteria for being at high risk, or when their clinical and laboratory picture suggests being at low risk for SBI.
Summary 2: A retrospective chart review of 492 infants aged <3 months who were hospitalized due to fever included 108 infants aged <1 month. Thirty percent (114) of the infants aged 1 to 3 months and 67% (72) of the younger infants underwent lumbar puncture at the discretion of the treating physician. All infants were retrospectively assigned to low- or high-risk groups for serious bacterial infection using the Rochester criteria. Of the 296 infants rated ""low-risk"", none developed bacterial meningitis. Ten of these infants subsequently developed evidence of another bacterial focus (predominantly urinary tract infection).

Query: Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis?
Document: A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of low risk criteria for identifying febrile neonates unlikely to have bacterial infections, particularly bacteremia and meningitis. Using these criteria we wished to check whether these low risk neonates can be safely managed as inpatients under close observation but without receiving empiric antibiotic therapy. We conducted a prospective study of 250 consecutive infants 28 days of age or less (range, 4 to 28 days) who had rectal temperatures of at least 38 degrees C. After a complete history, physical examination and sepsis workup, the 131 febrile neonates with clinical and laboratory findings indicating low risk for bacterial infections were hospitalized, closely observed and not given antibiotics. The low risk criteria used to identify these neonates included well appearance; absence of physical signs of an ear, eye or soft tissue infection; a white blood cell count of 5000 to 15,000/mm3, a neutrophil band form count of < 1500/mm3, a spun urine specimen that had < 10 white blood cells per high power field on microscopy and a C-reactive protein value of < 20 mg/l. The remaining 119 febrile neonates who did not meet the low risk criteria were hospitalized and given empiric antibiotics pending culture results. The overall incidence of bacterial infections in the 250 febrile neonates was 16.4% (41 neonates) with bacteremia and/or meningitis occurring in 4.4% (11 neonates). Of the 131 low risk neonates only one (0.8%) had a bacterial infection (urinary tract infection) compared with 40 (33.6%) among the 119 who did not meet the criteria (P < 0.05). The negative predictive value of these criteria for excluding bacterial infections was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.7% to 100%). For bacteremia and meningitis this figure became 100%. However, the positive predictive value and specificity of the criteria were too low to identify all febrile neonates with bacterial infections. Among the low risk group 58 (44.3%) were reclassified on the second or third hospital day, because of continued fever (35), poor activity (14) and white blood cell count > 15000/mm3 on a repeat blood test (9). They were given antibiotics, but only 1 had a urinary tract infection. This patient was then treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. All low risk neonates recovered uneventfully with no relapses observed during their hospital stay or at the time of minimum 1-week outpatient follow-up visits. By the low risk criteria a substantial number of febrile neonates at low risk for bacterial infections can be identified and managed safely as inpatients without antibiotic therapy.
Summary:","One prospective cohort study of infants aged <1 month hospitalized for fever used a similar method for assessing risk, but added a C-reactive protein value <20 mg/L to criteria for low-risk. Of 250 infants studied, 131 (52%) were low-risk; none of these developed bacterial meningitis."

Query 1: Does a knee brace decrease recurrent ACL injuries?
Document 1: This study prospectively randomized 62 patients to rehabilitation programs either with or without postoperative brace for 6 weeks following bone-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The nonbraced group had a smaller knee circumference 2 weeks after surgery. At 6-month follow-up the nonbraced group had a better Tegner score. At 2 years there was no difference between the groups. There was one partial rupture of the graft in the nonbraced group after a new trauma 1 year after surgery. There were no differences between the groups in either subjective or objective knee stability at 2 or 6 weeks or at follow-up 3, 6, and 24 months after surgery. This study found no benefit of using a postoperative knee brace on patients' knee function at any stage up to 24 months after surgery. Furthermore, the braced group was not more stable than the nonbraced group, indicating that the brace does not contribute to a more stable knee during rehabilitation or 2-year follow-up.
Summary 1: In a prospective study of 62 patients, researchers found no benefit from using a postoperative knee brace at any stage (2 and 6 weeks; 3, 6, and 24 months) after surgery. Moreover, the brace did not contribute to a more stable knee during rehabilitation or 2-year follow-up.

Query 2: What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy?
Document 2: Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury, especially among athletes involved in activities that include running and jumping. Often an initial period of rest from the pain-provoking activity is recommended. To prospectively evaluate if continued running and jumping during treatment with an Achilles tendon-loading strengthening program has an effect on the outcome. Randomized clinical control trial; Level of evidence, 1. Thirty-eight patients with Achilles tendinopathy were randomly allocated to 2 different treatment groups. The exercise training group (n = 19) was allowed, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, to continue Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, whereas the active rest group (n = 19) had to stop such activities during the first 6 weeks. All patients were rehabilitated according to an identical rehabilitation program. The primary outcome measures were the Swedish version of the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A-S) and the pain level during tendon-loading activity. No significant differences in the rate of improvements were found between the groups. Both groups showed, however, significant (P < .01) improvements, compared with baseline, on the primary outcome measure at all the evaluations. The exercise training group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.8) at baseline and 85 (12.7) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). The active rest group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.7) at baseline and 91 (8.2) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). No negative effects could be demonstrated from continuing Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, during treatment. Our treatment protocol for patients with Achilles tendinopathy, which gradually increases the load on the Achilles tendon and calf muscle, demonstrated significant improvements. A training regimen of continued, pain-monitored, tendon-loading physical activity might therefore represent a valuable option for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
Summary 2: During an eccentric calf-muscle training program, patients may be able to continue activity without exacerbating Achilles tendonopathy. An randomized controlled trials of 38 patients compared rest with eccentric training and continued activity and eccentric training for 12 weeks to 6 months using a pain-monitored model. Both groups showed similar improvement in pain and function when measured with the Swedish version of the Achilles assessment questionnaire (VISA-A-S 100-point scale: 0=worst function, 100=completely recovered). The baseline mean VISA-A-S scores were 57 for both groups; the mean scores after 12 months were 85 for the exercise group and 91 for the rest group.

Query: Does a knee brace decrease recurrent ACL injuries?
Document: To compare the functional performance of subjects with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Cross-sectional comparative clinical trial. A physical therapy outpatient department. Thirty-one subjects with unilateral ACL reconstruction for more than 5 months. Patients under 3 bracing conditions: (1) DonJoy Brace, (2) mechanical placebo brace, or (3) no brace. Running and turning 10 times on a 22-meter figure-8 runway, and running and jumping (and landing) on a semicircular path. Speed of running and turning, speed of running and jumping, and accuracy of landing after the jump. Subjects performed similarly in conditions 1 and 2 in all the tests, but the speeds of running and turning were significantly slower in conditions 1 and 2 than condition 3 (p =.008--.000). Results of the run and jump tests were not different among all conditions. Knee bracing may not improve functional performance of subjects 5 months after ACL reconstruction. The use of such a brace could actually slow down running and turning, irrespective of the mechanical constraints of the brace. These functional outcomes need to be noted when such a brace is used on this group of subjects.
Summary:","One study evaluated running, jumping, and turning performance with and without a functional brace in 31 patients who had had an ACL reconstruction 5 to 26 months previously. They measured significantly better performance without bracing; however, more than half the group perceived enhanced performance with the brace."

Query 1: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 1: Successful migraine prophylaxis with flunarizine has been reported in adults by several authors. We used flunarizine in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial in childhood migraine. Twenty-four children with classical or common migraine were followed by a 12-week flunarizine treatment period. Each patient took 5 mg/day of the drug before going to sleep. Twenty-four children with similar clinical characteristics were assigned to placebo treatment. Efficacy of flunarizine versus placebo was assessed on the basis of the reduction of headache frequency and duration. A statistical comparison was performed between values reported in the treatment period and those in the three months before. Children treated with flunarizine experienced a statistically significant reduction in headache (66%) and duration (51%). These results were statistically superior to those observed in the placebo group. Sixteen patients on flunarizine therapy experienced an improvement of more than 50% of both parameters. We found flunarizine is an effective agent in children's migraine prophylaxis. Moreover it is suitable for the low incidence of mild side effects.
Summary 1: In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 48 children, flunarizine decreased mean headache frequency (3.0 attacks/3 months vs 6.5 [P<.001]).

Query 2: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 2: An 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was carried out on the use of nimodipine in migraine prophylaxis in 37 patients aged 7 to 18 years old. After a 4-week medication-free run-in period, 19 subjects (Group 1) received a placebo while 18 (Group 2) received nimodipine (10-20 mg t.i.d., according to body weight), for 12 weeks. After a 4-week wash-out period, the groups switched therapy for a further 12 weeks. 30 patients completed the trial and the number of dropouts was comparable in the 2 groups. The only side-effect during nimodipine treatment was mild abdominal discomfort (3 cases). The treatments were evaluated on the basis of frequency and duration of attacks. There was a significant reduction in both parameters during the first period of treatment. During the second period of treatment, nimodipine proved to have a significantly greater effect than the placebo with regard to frequency, whereas the response was similar with the placebo as regards duration of attacks. The latter parameter shows a significant decrease during the treatment periods, regardless of type of therapy.
Summary 2: Nimodipine, in a single randomized controlled trial with crossover design in 37 children decreased headache frequency from a mean of ~2.7 attacks/month to ~1.9 vs. no change for placebo (P<.05).

Query: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document: In a prospective study we compared propranolol, placebo, and self-hypnosis in the treatment of juvenile classic migraine. Children aged 6 to 12 years with classic migraine who had no previous specific treatment were randomized into propranolol (at 3 mg/kg/d) or placebo groups for a 3-month period and then crossed over for 3 months. After this 6-month period, each child was taught self-hypnosis and used it for 3 months. Twenty-eight patients completed the entire study. The mean number of headaches per child for 3 months during the placebo period was 13.3 compared with 14.9 during the propranolol period and 5.8 during the self-hypnosis period. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between decrease in headache frequency and self-hypnosis training (P = .045). There was no significant change in subjective or objective measures of headache severity with either therapy.
Summary:","A comparative randomized controlled trial with multiple crossovers involving 33 children found that a self-hypnosis placebo decreased mean headache frequency from 13.3 per 3-month interval to 5.8 (P=.045), but found propranolol no different than placebo. Propranolol was also studied in a 3-armed randomized controlled trial in comparison with flunarizine-a drug likely to be efficacious-and placebo."

Query 1: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 1: Migraine is a cause of recurrent headache in childhood. The efficacy of sodium valproate is well known in the prophylactic treatment of adult migraine, but there are few studies involving the drug's effect in pediatric migraine. To determine the efficacy of sodium valproate in the prophylactic treatment of childhood migraine. Fifteen children with migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were included in the study. Headache severity was measured and assessed by Algology unit by a using visual analog scale and a numerical rating scale. All of the subjects were asked to keep a headache diary for 8 weeks. Three subjects who had no headache attacks during the baseline period and two cases who were lost to follow up were excluded. Thus, sodium valproate was initiated in 10 subjects (six boys, four girls), 500 mg/night, and the daily dose was increased up to 1000 mg according to blood levels. Their ages ranged from 9 to 17 (mean age 13.6 +/- 3.2 years). Therapy continued for at least 12 weeks. Headache severity as measured via the mean visual analog score was 6.8 +/- 1.8 at baseline and was 0.7 +/- 1.2 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.000). Mean headache attacks per month were 6 +/- 4.2 at baseline and were 0.8 +/- 1.9 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.002). The duration of headache was significantly decreased from a mean of 5.5 +/- 3.9 hours to 1.1 +/- 2.5 hours with treatment (P = 0.001). The observed side effects were dizziness, drowsiness, and increase in appetite; none required drug withdrawal. In two cases, headache attacks recurred after the cessation of valproate, and therapy was restarted. Headache control lasted for six months following cessation of the drug in the remainder of the subjects. Sodium valproate appears to be effective and safe in selected patients with childhood migraine.
Summary 1: A single uncontrolled interventional trial of valproic acid in 10 children showed a significant trend of improvement in frequency (mean of 6 attacks/month to 0.8 attacks/month) and duration (mean 5.5 hours per attack to 1.1 hour).

Query 2: Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 2: There is a need to identify effective and safe treatments for depression in children and adolescents. While tricyclic drugs are effective in treating depression in adults, individual studies involving children and adolescents have been equivocal. To assess the effects of oral tricyclic antidepressants compared to placebo in the treatment of child and adolescent depression. We searched MEDLINE (1966-1997), EMBASE, Excerpta Medica (June 1974-1997), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (most recent search 25/1/2000) and bibliographies of previously published reviews and papers describing original research were cross-checked. Current Contents was screened for recent publications. We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we hand searched the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1978-1999). Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of orally administered tricyclic medication with placebo in depressed people aged 6-18 years. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study the best available depression measure was taken as the index measure of depression outcome. Predetermined criteria were established to assist in the ranking of measures. Where authors reported categorical outcomes we calculated individual and pooled odds ratios for the odds of improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes pooled effect sizes were calculated as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control groups. Thirteen trials (involving 506 participants) were included. No overall improvement with treatment compared to placebo was seen for children or adolescents (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.25). A statistically significant but small benefit of treatment over placebo was seen in reducing symptoms (effect size (standardised mean difference) = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.62 to -0.01). Subgroup analyses suggest a larger benefit among adolescents (effect size = -0.47, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.02), and no benefit among children (effect size = 0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.34 to 0.64). Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused more vertigo (odds ratio = 4.38, 95% confidence interval 2.33 to 8.25), orthostatic hypotension (odds ratio = 6.78, 95% confidence interval 2.06 to 22.26), tremor (odds ratio 6.29, 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 22.17) and dry mouth (odds ratio = 5.17, 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 29.99) than did placebo, but no statistically significant difference was found for other possible adverse effects. Data suggest tricyclic antidepressants are not useful in treating depression in pre pubertal children. There is marginal evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of depression in adolescents, although the magnitude of effect is likely to be moderate at best.
Summary 2: A 2002 Cochrane meta-analysis reported marginal evidence to support using tricyclic antidepressants for treating adolescents. However, these drugs have significantly more side effects than placebo. No placebo-controlled RCTs of bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, or St. John's wort for treating major depressive disorder in adolescents were identified.

Query: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document: To study the effectiveness of a standardized dose of amitriptyline, 1 mg/kg, for childhood headaches. Amitriptyline has been shown to be effective for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults. Studies in children, however, have been quite limited. In adults, the suggested effective dose range is 10 to 150 mg. In children, a standardized dosage is often not used, resulting in a dosage range in clinical practice that often varies from a very low dose to a dose equivalent to that used in adults. Children with more than three headaches per month were treated with amitriptyline, slowly increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg per day. The frequency, severity, and duration of their headaches were initially evaluated and subsequently measured at each follow-up evaluation. Two hundred seventy-nine children had headaches occurring frequently enough to indicate prophylactic treatment. Of these children, 192 (68.8%) were treated with amitriptyline. The average age at presentation was 12.0 (+/- 3.0) years. The ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.74. The average frequency of headaches was 17.1 (+/- 10.1) days per month. The average severity was 6.84 (+/- 1.67) on a 10-point pain scale. The average duration was 11.5 (+/- 15.0) hours. The most frequent diagnoses using International Headache Society criteria were migraine (60.6%), migraine with aura (7.9%), and tension-type headache (10.4%). Of these children, 146 have been seen for at least one follow-up examination, occurring on average 67.3 (+/- 32.3) days after beginning prophylactic treatment. A total of 84.2% of the children reported an overall perception of being better, while 11.6% reported being the same. The frequency of headaches improved to 9.2 (+/- 10.0) days per month. The average severity was reduced to 5.1 (+/- 2.1), and the average duration was reduced to 6.3 (+/- 11.1) hours. If daily or continuous headaches were excluded, the improvements were more marked. Minimal side effects were reported from these children and their families. Long-term evaluation (156 to 415 days) showed continued sustained improvement. Amitriptyline is an effective prophylactic medication for children with frequent headaches. A standardized dosing regimen results in a significant number of children responding with minimal side effects. The children are able to tolerate this dosing scheme and demonstrate good adherence to a dosing schedule of once a day.
Summary:","A prospective cohort trial studied 192 children. Of the 146 patients available for the first follow-up visit, 84% noted subjective improvement of symptoms. Headache frequency decreased from 17.1 ± 10.1 to 9.2 ± 10.0 days/month (P<.001)."

Query 1: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 1: Migraine is a cause of recurrent headache in childhood. The efficacy of sodium valproate is well known in the prophylactic treatment of adult migraine, but there are few studies involving the drug's effect in pediatric migraine. To determine the efficacy of sodium valproate in the prophylactic treatment of childhood migraine. Fifteen children with migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were included in the study. Headache severity was measured and assessed by Algology unit by a using visual analog scale and a numerical rating scale. All of the subjects were asked to keep a headache diary for 8 weeks. Three subjects who had no headache attacks during the baseline period and two cases who were lost to follow up were excluded. Thus, sodium valproate was initiated in 10 subjects (six boys, four girls), 500 mg/night, and the daily dose was increased up to 1000 mg according to blood levels. Their ages ranged from 9 to 17 (mean age 13.6 +/- 3.2 years). Therapy continued for at least 12 weeks. Headache severity as measured via the mean visual analog score was 6.8 +/- 1.8 at baseline and was 0.7 +/- 1.2 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.000). Mean headache attacks per month were 6 +/- 4.2 at baseline and were 0.8 +/- 1.9 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.002). The duration of headache was significantly decreased from a mean of 5.5 +/- 3.9 hours to 1.1 +/- 2.5 hours with treatment (P = 0.001). The observed side effects were dizziness, drowsiness, and increase in appetite; none required drug withdrawal. In two cases, headache attacks recurred after the cessation of valproate, and therapy was restarted. Headache control lasted for six months following cessation of the drug in the remainder of the subjects. Sodium valproate appears to be effective and safe in selected patients with childhood migraine.
Summary 1: A single uncontrolled interventional trial of valproic acid in 10 children showed a significant trend of improvement in frequency (mean of 6 attacks/month to 0.8 attacks/month) and duration (mean 5.5 hours per attack to 1.1 hour).

Query 2: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 2: Successful migraine prophylaxis with flunarizine has been reported in adults by several authors. We used flunarizine in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial in childhood migraine. Twenty-four children with classical or common migraine were followed by a 12-week flunarizine treatment period. Each patient took 5 mg/day of the drug before going to sleep. Twenty-four children with similar clinical characteristics were assigned to placebo treatment. Efficacy of flunarizine versus placebo was assessed on the basis of the reduction of headache frequency and duration. A statistical comparison was performed between values reported in the treatment period and those in the three months before. Children treated with flunarizine experienced a statistically significant reduction in headache (66%) and duration (51%). These results were statistically superior to those observed in the placebo group. Sixteen patients on flunarizine therapy experienced an improvement of more than 50% of both parameters. We found flunarizine is an effective agent in children's migraine prophylaxis. Moreover it is suitable for the low incidence of mild side effects.
Summary 2: In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 48 children, flunarizine decreased mean headache frequency (3.0 attacks/3 months vs 6.5 [P<.001]).

Query: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document: Migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society, occurs in about 3 to 7% of all children. Despite this high incidence, and unlike the situation with adult migraine, only a very few controlled trials have investigated the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine in children. In the acute migraine attack, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 15 mg/kg have been shown to be effective, with only a few adverse effects. In severe migraine attacks, dihydroergotamine mesylate (dihydroergotamine) administered orally (20 to 40 microg/kg) or intravenously (maximum 1 mg/day) may be helpful, but there have been no large placebo-controlled trials of this treatment. Oral sumatriptan has not been effective in several double-blind and placebo-controlled trials; administered subcutaneously, this drug might be helpful but the only data for this application come from open trials. For migraine prophylaxis, only flunarizine 5 mg/day has been shown to be effective in more than 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Some evidence also exists that propranolol >60 mg/day and pizotifen 0.5 to 1.5 mg/day are effective; however, the results from different trials are contradictory. For all other drugs studied in migraine prophylaxis, the results remain vague (e.g. amitriptyline, nimodipine, trazodone) or suggest inefficacy (e.g. timolol, clonidine, tryptophan). In migraine-related disorders, pizotifen 0.5 to 0.75 mg/day for abdominal migraine and flunarizine 10 to 25 mg/day for alternating hemiplegia have been shown to be effective. Most of the drugs used in the treatment of migraine in children are well tolerated and without relevant adverse effects. In migraine prophylaxis, the most common adverse effects are drowsiness and bodyweight gain.
Summary:","Flunarizine was found to be effective in multiple well-designed randomized controlled trials and case series, as well as in multiple comparative trials with other agents."

Query 1: What medication best prevents migraine in children?
Document 1: An 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was carried out on the use of nimodipine in migraine prophylaxis in 37 patients aged 7 to 18 years old. After a 4-week medication-free run-in period, 19 subjects (Group 1) received a placebo while 18 (Group 2) received nimodipine (10-20 mg t.i.d., according to body weight), for 12 weeks. After a 4-week wash-out period, the groups switched therapy for a further 12 weeks. 30 patients completed the trial and the number of dropouts was comparable in the 2 groups. The only side-effect during nimodipine treatment was mild abdominal discomfort (3 cases). The treatments were evaluated on the basis of frequency and duration of attacks. There was a significant reduction in both parameters during the first period of treatment. During the second period of treatment, nimodipine proved to have a significantly greater effect than the placebo with regard to frequency, whereas the response was similar with the placebo as regards duration of attacks. The latter parameter shows a significant decrease during the treatment periods, regardless of type of therapy.
Summary 1: Nimodipine, in a single randomized controlled trial with crossover design in 37 children decreased headache frequency from a mean of ~2.7 attacks/month to ~1.9 vs. no change for placebo (P<.05).

Document: An 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of flunarizine in the prophylaxis of migraine has been performed in 70 children. After 4 weeks of medication-free base-line observation, 35 children (group A) received flunarizine (5 mg/day) and 35 (group B) received placebo over a 12-week period. After a 4-week washout they crossed treatments for another 12 weeks. Sixty-three patients completed the trial. In both groups flunarizine significantly reduced the frequency and average duration of headache attacks. In group A efficacy was maintained after placebo crossover for the last 4 months of the study. Five subjects in group B stopped placebo because of ineffectiveness; two children in group A discontinued flunarizine treatment, one because of excessive daytime sedation and the other because therapy was ineffective. The main side effects were daytime sedation and weight gain. It is concluded that flunarizine is an effective drug for the treatment of childhood migraine. In a study of this length no serious side effects were discovered.

Query 1: Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease?
Document 1: It has been suggested that increased intake of various antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence rates of vascular disease, cancer, and other adverse outcomes. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive antioxidant vitamin supplementation (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or matching placebo. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcome were conducted between all vitamin-allocated and all placebo-allocated participants. An average of 83% of participants in each treatment group remained compliant during the scheduled 5-year treatment period. Allocation to this vitamin regimen approximately doubled the plasma concentration of alpha-tocopherol, increased that of vitamin C by one-third, and quadrupled that of beta-carotene. Primary outcomes were major coronary events (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (1446 [14.1%] vitamin-allocated vs 1389 [13.5%] placebo-allocated), or in deaths due to vascular (878 [8.6%] vs 840 [8.2%]) or non-vascular (568 [5.5%] vs 549 [5.3%]) causes. Nor were there any significant differences in the numbers of participants having non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (1063 [10.4%] vs 1047 [10.2%]), non-fatal or fatal stroke (511 [5.0%] vs 518 [5.0%]), or coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (1058 [10.3%] vs 1086 [10.6%]). For the first occurrence of any of these ""major vascular events"", there were no material differences either overall (2306 [22.5%] vs 2312 [22.5%]; event rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.94-1.06]) or in any of the various subcategories considered. There were no significant effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Among the high-risk individuals that were studied, these antioxidant vitamins appeared to be safe. But, although this regimen increased blood vitamin concentrations substantially, it did not produce any significant reductions in the 5-year mortality from, or incidence of, any type of vascular disease, cancer, or other major outcome.
Summary 1: A randomized, placebo-controlled study of simvastatin 40 mg and antioxidants (vitamin E 600 mg, vitamin C 250 mg, beta-carotene 20 mg) enrolled 20,536 adults aged 40 to 80 years with known coronary artery disease or high risk for CAD. No significant difference was found in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.04), major coronary events (RR, 1.02), any stroke (RR, 0.99), or any major vascular event (RR, 1.00). The investigators found no evidence of an adverse affect of the antioxidants on the substantial outcome benefits demonstrated with 40 mg daily of simvastatin.

Document 2: Antioxidants increase the resistance of low-density lipoprotein to oxidation and may thereby reduce risk for atherosclerosis. To determine whether intake of vitamin E, vitamin C, or carotenoids predict risk for total or ischemic stroke. Prospective observational study. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study. 43,738 men 40 to 75 years of age who did not have cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Repeated and validated dietary assessments were done by using a self-administered 131-item food-frequency questionnaire, which included questions on dose and duration of vitamin supplement use. The follow-up period was 8 years. A total of 328 strokes occurred: 210 ischemic, 70 hemorrhagic, and 48 unclassified. After adjustment for age, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, body mass index, physical activity, parental history of myocardial infarction, alcohol consumption, and total energy intake, the relative risk for ischemic stroke in the top quintile of vitamin E intake (median, 411 IU/d) compared with the bottom quintile (5.4 IU/d) was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.82). The relative risk for ischemic stroke in the top quintile of vitamin C intake (1167 mg/d) compared with the bottom quintile (95 mg/d) was 1.03 (CI, 0.66 to 1.59). Results for total stroke were similar. Associations of vitamin intake with hemorrhagic stroke were also nonsignificant, but the CIs were wide. Neither dose nor duration of vitamin E or vitamin C supplement use was related to risk for total or ischemic stroke. The relative risk for ischemic stroke was 1.16 (CI, 0.81 to 1.67) in men using 250 IU or more of vitamin E supplementation per day compared with men who used no vitamin E supplements and was 0.93 (CI, 0.60 to 1.45) in men using 700 mg or more of vitamin C supplementation per day compared with men who used no vitamin C supplements. A significant inverse relation between lutein intake and risk for ischemic stroke was seen but was not independent of other dietary factors. Vitamin E and vitamin C supplements and specific carotenoids did not seem to substantially reduce risk for stroke in this cohort. Modest effects, however, cannot be excluded.
Summary 2: Although prior observational studies have hinted at a link between antioxidants and improved cardiovascular outcomes, the recently published Health Professionals Follow-up Study found no benefit to vitamin C or E in preventing strokes, based on the dietary assessment of 43,738 men, aged 40 to 75 years, who were not known to have cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

Query 1: In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke?
Document 1: Observational data suggest that diets rich in fruits and vegetables and with high serum levels of antioxidants are associated with decreased incidence and mortality of stroke. We studied the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation. The incidence and mortality of stroke were examined in 28 519 male cigarette smokers aged 50 to 69 years without history of stroke who participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study). The daily supplementation was 50 mg alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg beta-carotene, both, or placebo. The median follow-up was 6.0 years. A total of 1057 men suffered from incident stroke: 85 men had subarachnoid hemorrhage; 112, intracerebral hemorrhage; 807, cerebral infarction; and 53, unspecified stroke. Deaths due to stroke within 3 months numbered 38, 50, 65, and 7, respectively (total 160). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage 50% (95% CI -3% to 132%, P=0.07) but decreased that of cerebral infarction 14% (95% CI -25% to -1%, P=0.03), whereas beta-carotene supplementation increased the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage 62% (95% CI 10% to 136%, P=0.01). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation also increased the risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage 181% (95% CI 37% to 479%, P=0.01). The overall net effects of either supplementation on the incidence and mortality from total stroke were nonsignificant. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increases the risk of fatal hemorrhagic strokes but prevents cerebral infarction. The effects may be due to the antiplatelet actions of alpha-tocopherol. beta-Carotene supplementation increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, but no obvious mechanism is available.
Summary 1: In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 29,133 Finnish male smokers, the overall net stroke morbidity and mortality with antioxidants was not significantly different from placebo. However, a trend toward higher rates of subarachnoid hemorrhages was found (relative risk [RR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.32; numbers needed to harm [NNH] = 833), while the cerebral infarction rate was decreased (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99; numbers needed to treat = 239) by vitamin E. Beta-carotene increased intracerebral hemorrhage (RR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.10-2.36; number needed to harm = 546).

Query: In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke?
Document: High serum or dietary levels of vitamin E and beta carotene appear to be associated with lower risk of stroke, but studies regarding their supplementation have not supported their use in stroke prevention. To determine if vitamin E (dl-alpha tocopherol) and beta carotene supplementations could be used in prevention of stroke in men at high risk for hemorrhagic or ischemic events. Population-based, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial design trial (the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study), conducted from April 1985 through April 30, 1993, with median follow-up of 6 years. Alpha tocopherol, 50 mg; beta carotene, 20 mg; both; or placebo. From the total male population aged 50 through 69 years in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406), 29,133 male smokers were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment regimens. We excluded 614 men because of previous stroke at baseline, leaving 28, 519. Incident and fatal subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and unspecified stroke. Stroke occurred in a total of 1057 men: 85 had subarachnoid and 112 had intracerebral hemorrhage, 807 had cerebral infarction, and 53 had unspecified stroke. Within 90 days from onset, 160 men died of stroke. Vitamin E supplementation increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (relative risk [RR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-5.55) and decreased risk of cerebral infarction (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89) in hypertensive men but had no effect among normotensive men. Furthermore, it decreased the risk of cerebral infarction, without elevating the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, among hypertensive men with concurrent diabetes (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78). Beta carotene supplementation appeared to increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and modestly decrease that of cerebral infarction among men with greater alcohol consumption. Vitamin E supplementation may prevent ischemic stroke in high-risk hypertensive patients, but further studies are needed. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1503-1509
Summary:","Subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in cerebral infarction (RR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78) without increasing subarachnoid hemorrhage in hypertensive, diabetic men taking vitamin E."

Query 1: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document 1: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.
Summary 1: nicotine replacement therapy reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by partially replacing nicotine in the blood. Abstinence rates are superior to placebo based on a Cochrane review (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.66-1.88; NNT=20; 95% CI, 17-23).

Query 2: How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk?
Document 2: To assess the short-term impact of smoking and smoking cessation measured by self-report and by serum cotinine on the risk of secondary cardiovascular disease events (CVD events). Cohort study among participants of an in-patient 3-week rehabilitation programme following an acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery revascularization. Smoking status at baseline was assessed by self-report (beginning of the rehabilitation programme, rehab) and serum cotinine (end of rehab). Active follow-up was conducted one year later. Subsequent CVD events were observed in 139 of the 967 patients. Both self-reported smoking status (odds ratio (OR) compared to continued smokers: recent quitters 0.96, former smokers 0.83, never smokers 0.54, p for trend 0.04) and serum cotinine (OR 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.97) for cotinine-negative compared to cotinine-positive subjects) were associated with the occurrence of a secondary CVD event. After reclassification of all cotinine-positive subjects to continued smokers and cotinine-negative self-reported smokers to recent quitters, this association became even stronger. The OR now reached 0.71 (95% CI interval 0.38-1.33) for recent quitters, 0.64 (0.36-1.11) for former smokers and 0.44 (0.24-0.81) for never smokers (p-value for trend=0.009). The benefits of non-smoking and smoking cessation in cardiac patients are beyond controversy and might even be larger than suggested by previous studies which exclusively relied on self-reported smoking status.
Summary 2: Smoking cessation has also been found to significantly affect morbidity among cardiac patients. Short-term benefits have been demonstrated in coronary heart disease patients after a myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization. Smoking status at 1-year follow-up was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent cardiac events (myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular event, revascularization, or death from CHD) when smokers who quit after an initial coronary heart disease event were compared with continuing smokers (odds ratio=0.71; 95% CI, 0.38-1.33).

Query: What interventions can help patients stop using chewing tobacco?
Document: There were two experiments on abstinence from smokeless tobacco. The purpose of the first experiment was to determine abstinence effects from smokeless tobacco. The purpose of the second experiment was to examine the effects of different doses of nicotine gum on smokeless tobacco abstinence effects. The subjects were male Copenhagen smokeless tobacco users who underwent 3 days of baseline measurement while continuing to use smokeless tobacco ad libitum, and 5 days of the experimental condition. In the first experiment, the subjects were assigned randomly to one of two groups and compared: continuous smokeless tobacco users (n = 10), and deprivation plus no nicotine gum (n = 10). In the second experiment, subjects were assigned randomly and in a double-blind fashion to one of three groups and compared: (1) deprivation plus 0 mg nicotine gum (n = 20); (2) deprivation plus 2 mg nicotine gum (n = 20); and (3) deprivation plus 4 mg nicotine gum (n = 20). The first experiment showed significant increases upon abstinence for the following variables: (1) craving; (2) difficulty concentrating; (3) restlessness; (4) excessive hunger; (5) eating; (6) reaction time; (7) variability of reaction time and (8) total withdrawal scores for both the self-rated and the observer-rated forms. The second experiment showed that nicotine gum failed to significantly reduce smokeless tobacco abstinence effects, although those with high cotinine levels may receive some benefit from nicotine gum.
Summary:","A small double-blind study randomized 79 male smokeless tobacco users to chew nicotine gum (0 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg) for 5 days. Sixty patients completed the study. No significant differences in withdrawal symptoms, including cravings, concentration, or restlessness, were noted among the 3 groups (P>.05). However, further analysis demonstrated that patients with high blood levels of cotinine who received nicotine gum 2 mg experienced decreased cravings compared with placebo (P<.001), and a trend towards decreased cravings with 4 mg gum was noted (P<.06). Limitations of this study: quit rates were not reported, participants did not have to be motivated to quit smokeless tobacco in order to enroll, and it is not known if patients were counseled about the appropriate ""chew and park"" technique for nicotine gum."

Query 1: In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke?
Document 1: Observational data suggest that diets rich in fruits and vegetables and with high serum levels of antioxidants are associated with decreased incidence and mortality of stroke. We studied the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation. The incidence and mortality of stroke were examined in 28 519 male cigarette smokers aged 50 to 69 years without history of stroke who participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study). The daily supplementation was 50 mg alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg beta-carotene, both, or placebo. The median follow-up was 6.0 years. A total of 1057 men suffered from incident stroke: 85 men had subarachnoid hemorrhage; 112, intracerebral hemorrhage; 807, cerebral infarction; and 53, unspecified stroke. Deaths due to stroke within 3 months numbered 38, 50, 65, and 7, respectively (total 160). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage 50% (95% CI -3% to 132%, P=0.07) but decreased that of cerebral infarction 14% (95% CI -25% to -1%, P=0.03), whereas beta-carotene supplementation increased the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage 62% (95% CI 10% to 136%, P=0.01). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation also increased the risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage 181% (95% CI 37% to 479%, P=0.01). The overall net effects of either supplementation on the incidence and mortality from total stroke were nonsignificant. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increases the risk of fatal hemorrhagic strokes but prevents cerebral infarction. The effects may be due to the antiplatelet actions of alpha-tocopherol. beta-Carotene supplementation increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, but no obvious mechanism is available.
Summary 1: In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 29,133 Finnish male smokers, the overall net stroke morbidity and mortality with antioxidants was not significantly different from placebo. However, a trend toward higher rates of subarachnoid hemorrhages was found (relative risk [RR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.32; numbers needed to harm [NNH] = 833), while the cerebral infarction rate was decreased (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99; numbers needed to treat = 239) by vitamin E. Beta-carotene increased intracerebral hemorrhage (RR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.10-2.36; number needed to harm = 546).

Query 2: Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease?
Document 2: It has been suggested that increased intake of various antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence rates of vascular disease, cancer, and other adverse outcomes. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive antioxidant vitamin supplementation (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or matching placebo. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcome were conducted between all vitamin-allocated and all placebo-allocated participants. An average of 83% of participants in each treatment group remained compliant during the scheduled 5-year treatment period. Allocation to this vitamin regimen approximately doubled the plasma concentration of alpha-tocopherol, increased that of vitamin C by one-third, and quadrupled that of beta-carotene. Primary outcomes were major coronary events (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (1446 [14.1%] vitamin-allocated vs 1389 [13.5%] placebo-allocated), or in deaths due to vascular (878 [8.6%] vs 840 [8.2%]) or non-vascular (568 [5.5%] vs 549 [5.3%]) causes. Nor were there any significant differences in the numbers of participants having non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (1063 [10.4%] vs 1047 [10.2%]), non-fatal or fatal stroke (511 [5.0%] vs 518 [5.0%]), or coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (1058 [10.3%] vs 1086 [10.6%]). For the first occurrence of any of these ""major vascular events"", there were no material differences either overall (2306 [22.5%] vs 2312 [22.5%]; event rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.94-1.06]) or in any of the various subcategories considered. There were no significant effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Among the high-risk individuals that were studied, these antioxidant vitamins appeared to be safe. But, although this regimen increased blood vitamin concentrations substantially, it did not produce any significant reductions in the 5-year mortality from, or incidence of, any type of vascular disease, cancer, or other major outcome.
Summary 2: A randomized, placebo-controlled study of simvastatin 40 mg and antioxidants (vitamin E 600 mg, vitamin C 250 mg, beta-carotene 20 mg) enrolled 20,536 adults aged 40 to 80 years with known coronary artery disease or high risk for CAD. No significant difference was found in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.04), major coronary events (RR, 1.02), any stroke (RR, 0.99), or any major vascular event (RR, 1.00). The investigators found no evidence of an adverse affect of the antioxidants on the substantial outcome benefits demonstrated with 40 mg daily of simvastatin.

Query: Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease?
Document: Epidemiological data suggest that the intake of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and beta-carotene has an inverse correlation with the incidence of coronary heart disease. The results from clinical trials of antioxidant supplementation in people with known coronary heart disease are inconclusive. We studied the frequency of major coronary events in 1862 men enrolled in the alpha-tocopherol beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study (smokers aged between 50 and 69 years) who had a previous myocardial infarction. In this randomised, double-blind. placebo-controlled study, men had received dietary supplements of alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day), beta-carotene (20 mg/day), both, or placebo. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. The endpoint of this substudy was the first major coronary event after randomisation. Analyses were by intention to treat. 424 major coronary events (non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease) occurred during follow-up. There were no significant differences in the number of major coronary events between any supplementation group and the placebo group (alpha-tocopherol 94/466; beta-carotene 113/461; alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene 123/497; placebo 94/438 [log-rank test, p = 0.25]). There were significantly more deaths from fatal coronary heart disease in the beta-carotene (74/461, multivariate-adjusted relative risk 1.75 [95% CI 1.16-2.64], p = 0.007) and combined alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene groups (67/497, relative risk 1.58 [1.05-2.40], p = 0.03) than in the placebo group (39/438), but there was no significant increase in the alpha-tocopherol supplementation group (54/466, relative risk 1.33 [0.86-2.05], p = 0.20). The proportion of major coronary events in men with a previous myocardial infarction who smoke was not decreased with either alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplements. In fact, the risk of fatal coronary heart disease increased in the groups that received either beta-carotene or the combination of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene; there was a non-significant trend of increased deaths in the alpha-tocopherol group. We do not recommend the use of alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplements in this group of patients.
Summary:","One double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events. In a subgroup analysis of this study, 1862 men with history of MI also had reduced risk of non-fatal MI (RR, 0.23)."

Query 1: Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease?
Document 1: Observational and experimental studies suggest that the amount of vitamin E ingested in food and in supplements is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. We enrolled a total of 2545 women and 6996 men 55 years of age or older who were at high risk for cardiovascular events because they had cardiovascular disease or diabetes in addition to one other risk factor. These patients were randomly assigned according to a two-by-two factorial design to receive either 400 IU of vitamin E daily from natural sources or matching placebo and either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ramipril) or matching placebo for a mean of 4.5 years (the results of the comparison of ramipril and placebo are reported in a companion article). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary outcomes included unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation, death from any cause, complications of diabetes, and cancer. A total of 772 of the 4761 patients assigned to vitamin E (16.2 percent) and 739 of the 4780 assigned to placebo (15.5 percent) had a primary outcome event (relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.16; P=0.33). There were no significant differences in the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular causes (342 of those assigned to vitamin E vs. 328 of those assigned to placebo; relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.22), myocardial infarction (532 vs. 524; relative risk, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.15), or stroke (209 vs. 180; relative risk, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.42). There were also no significant differences in the incidence of secondary cardiovascular outcomes or in death from any cause. There were no significant adverse effects of vitamin E. In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes.
Summary 1: One double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events.

Query 2: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 2: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 2: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query: Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease?
Document: Both lipid-modifying therapy and antioxidant vitamins are thought to have benefit in patients with coronary disease. We studied simvastatin-niacin and antioxidant-vitamin therapy, alone and together, for cardiovascular protection in patients with coronary disease and low plasma levels of HDL. In a three-year, double-blind trial, 160 patients with coronary disease, low HDL cholesterol levels and normal LDL cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens: simvastatin plus niacin, vitamins, simvastatin-niacin plus antioxidants; or placebos. The end points were arteriographic evidence of a change in coronary stenosis and the occurrence of a first cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization). The mean levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol were unaltered in the antioxidant group and the placebo group; these levels changed substantially (by -42 percent and +26 percent, respectively) in the simvastatin-niacin group. The protective increase in HDL2 with simvastatin plus niacin was attenuated by concurrent therapy with antioxidants. The average stenosis progressed by 3.9 percent with placebos, 1.8 percent with antioxidants (P=0.16 for the comparison with the placebo group), and 0.7 percent with simvastatin-niacin plus antioxidants (P=0.004) and regressed by 0.4 percent with simvastatin-niacin alone (P<0.001). The frequency of the clinical end point was 24 percent with placebos; 3 percent with simvastatin-niacin alone; 21 percent in the antioxidant-therapy group; and 14 percent in the simvastatin-niacin-plus-antioxidants group. Simvastatin plus niacin provides marked clinical and angiographically measurable benefits in patients with coronary disease and low HDL levels. The use of antioxidant vitamins in this setting must be questioned.
Summary:","A study suggests a negative interaction between simvastatin plus niacin and antioxidant supplementation (composed of vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and selenium)."

Query 1: What is the best way to evaluate secondary infertility?
Document 1: To clarify the role of a combined diagnostic approach using laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility in developing countries. In a prospective study, 612 consecutive infertile women underwent complete fertility evaluation at a tertiary university infertility clinic: 300 complained of primary infertility, 221 of secondary infertility, and 91 were requesting reversal of a previous tubal ligation. All the patients were examined by simultaneous combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as a part of their routine infertility evaluation. Focused hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction was attempted. Laparoscopy was successful in 608 and hysteroscopy in 597 patients. The most frequent pathologies detected hysteroscopically in the infertile group were adhesive in nature and believed to be post-traumatic and/or post-phlogistic. The number of intrauterine abnormalities found by hysteroscopy was significantly greater than by hysterosalpingography. The rate of diagnosis of significant lesions by laparoscopy of 64.3% rose to 76.6% when the hysteroscopic findings were included. A significant number of women with secondary infertility had abnormal hysteroscopic findings when compared to either women with primary infertility or those requesting sterilization reversal. Hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction revealed significant lesions believed to have caused infertility in comparison with those requesting sterilization reversal. The combined diagnostic approach of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy is recommended in the evaluation of female infertility in communities where the risk of pelvic infections is great.
Summary 1: One study demonstrated increased diagnostic yield with a combined approach of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, in communities where the risk of pelvic infection was great.

Query 2: What is the best way to evaluate secondary infertility?
Document 2: To investigate the impact of the postcoital test on the pregnancy rate among subfertile couples and on the number of other diagnostic tests and treatments. Randomised controlled study. A university and two non-university teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. New couples at infertility clinics, 1 March 1993 to 1 October 1995; randomisation to an intervention group (series of infertility investigations that include the postcoital test) or to a control group (series excluding the test). Cumulative pregnancy rate. Of 736 consecutive new couples, 444 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented to participate (intervention group, 227; control group, 217). Treatment was given more often in the intervention group than in the control group (54% v 41%; difference 13% (95% confidence interval 4% to 22%)). Yet cumulative pregnancy rates at 24 months in the intervention group (49% (42% to 55%)) and the control group (48% (42% to 55%)) were closely similar (difference 1% (-9.0% to 9.0%)). Routine use of the postcoital test in infertility investigations leads to more tests and treatments but has no significant effect on the pregnancy rate.
Summary 2: A randomized controlled trial compared 227 couples who received the postcoital test with 217 couples who did not. Routine use of the postcoital test led to more tests and more treatments but had no significant effect on the pregnancy rate.

Query 1: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 1: The purpose of this study, which involved two dermatology clinics and two podiatric medical clinics, was to determine whether a difference exists in patient-reported satisfaction and compliance between continuous terbinafine therapy and pulse-dose itraconazole therapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Patients in this multicenter, open-label, cross-sectional study had previously completed treatment with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Patients were interviewed by telephone to assess clinical outcomes, compliance, and satisfaction with treatment; clinical data were collected by medical chart review. Patients reported significantly greater ease and convenience of treatment and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine therapy compared with pulse-dose itraconazole therapy.
Summary 1: Terbinafine is well-tolerated by most patients. A telephone survey after treatment with daily terbinafine or pulse-dose itraconazole reported greater ease and convenience, and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine vs pulse-dose itraconazole.

Query 2: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 2: Toenail onychomycosis is a challenge for clinicians to treat, and this challenge is compounded by conflicting information in the medical literature concerning the efficacy of the two principal agents used in its treatment: terbinafine and itraconazole. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of terbinafinewith that of itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. A Medline search was performed for all English language publications from 1966 to June 1999 on the use of terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Included were randomized studies in which subjects received no less than 3 months (or cycles) and no more than 4 months (or cycles) of either terbinafine or itraconazole. Data were abstracted and statistical analyses (random effects model, fixed effects model, and Peto's method) were applied. Thirteen studies were included from the original literature review of 1636 total referenced reports; four studies did not fulfill our inclusion or exclusion criteria. The primary analysis of six studies directly comparing terbinafine to itraconazole resulted in an odds ratio ranging from 1.8 (95% CI = 1.8, 2.8) to 2.9 (1.9, 4.1). The secondary analysis of three studies comparing either itraconazole or terbinafine to placebo estimated an odds ratio of 1.1-1.7. The former shows that terbinafine is 80%-190% more likely to result in mycologic cure than is itraconazole; the latter demonstrates a 10%-70% greater likelihood. The difference between the relative efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Meta-analysis of the published worldwide literature finds that terbinafine is significantly more effective than itraconazole at achieving mycologic cure of toenail onychomycosis.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis of 6 studies comparing terbinafine with itraconazole reported odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8) to 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.1), indicating an 80% to 190% increased likelihood of clinical cure with terbinafine compared with itraconazole.

Query: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document: Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis. Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails. Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; P =.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; P =.007, RR =1.52 [95% CI, 1.11-2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; P =.02, RR=1.45 [95% CI, 1.04-2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; P =.03, RR =1.71 [95% CI, 1.05-2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (chi2 =1.63; P =.65). The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis. This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.
Summary:","A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial compared daily terbinafine with pulse-dose terbinafine. Daily terbinafine (250 mg for 3 months) had a 70.9% mycologic cure, while pulse-dose terbinafine (500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months) had only a 58.7% mycologic cure (relative risk [RR]=1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.43]; NNT=8.2). There was no significant difference in tolerability of the regimens."

Query 1: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 1: The purpose of this study, which involved two dermatology clinics and two podiatric medical clinics, was to determine whether a difference exists in patient-reported satisfaction and compliance between continuous terbinafine therapy and pulse-dose itraconazole therapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Patients in this multicenter, open-label, cross-sectional study had previously completed treatment with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Patients were interviewed by telephone to assess clinical outcomes, compliance, and satisfaction with treatment; clinical data were collected by medical chart review. Patients reported significantly greater ease and convenience of treatment and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine therapy compared with pulse-dose itraconazole therapy.
Summary 1: Terbinafine is well-tolerated by most patients. A telephone survey after treatment with daily terbinafine or pulse-dose itraconazole reported greater ease and convenience, and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine vs pulse-dose itraconazole.

Query 2: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document 2: Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole. A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent). There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 +/- 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 +/- 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 +/- 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 +/- 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 +/- 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 +/- 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 +/- 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 +/- 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 +/- 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 +/- 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 +/- 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 +/- 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 +/- 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 +/- 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 +/- 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 +/- 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001). The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.
Summary 2: A meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of terbinafine (Lamisil), pulse-dosed and continuous-dosed itraconazole (Sporanox), fluconazole (Diflucan), and griseofulvin showed mycological cure rates of varying degrees for each treatment.

Query: Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis?
Document: To examine long-term cure and relapse rates after treatment with continuous terbinafine and intermittent itraconazole in onychomycosis. Long-term prospective follow-up study. Three centers in Iceland. The study population comprised 151 patients aged 18 to 75 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. In a double-blind, double-dummy study, patients were randomized to receive either terbinafine (250 mg/d) for 12 or 16 weeks or itraconazole (400 mg/d) for 1 week in every 4 for 12 or 16 weeks (first intervention). Patients who did not achieve clinical cure at month 18 or experienced relapse or reinfection were offered an additional course of terbinafine (second intervention). The primary efficacy criterion was mycological cure, defined as negative results on microscopy and culture at the end of follow-up and no requirement of second intervention treatment. Secondary efficacy criteria included clinical cure without second intervention treatment and mycological and clinical relapse rates. Median duration of follow-up was 54 months. At the end of the study, mycological cure without second intervention treatment was found in 34 (46%) of the 74 terbinafine-treated subjects and 10 (13%) of the 77 itraconazole-treated subjects (P<.001). Mycological and clinical relapse rates were significantly higher in itraconazole vs terbinafine-treated patients (53% vs 23% and 48% vs 21%, respectively). Of the 72 patients who received subsequent terbinafine treatment, 63 (88%) achieved mycological cure and 55 (76%) achieved clinical cure. In the treatment of onychomycosis, continuous terbinafine provided superior long-term mycological and clinical efficacy and lower rates of mycological and clinical relapse compared with intermittent itraconazole.
Summary:",A 5-year blinded prospective study found long-term mycologic cures of 46% for terbinafine vs 13% for itraconazole (number needed to treat [NNT]=4.3). This study also showed a lower clinical relapse for terbinafine (21% vs 48%; NNT=3.7).

Query 1: Do angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetes without proteinuria?
Document 1: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate the decline in renal function in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. However, no data are available on the use of ACE inhibitors to prevent the decrease in renal function in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the effect of prolonged ACE inhibition on renal function and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 6-year follow-up. Eight outpatient clinics coordinated by a department of medicine in a university hospital. 156 patients in whom type 2 diabetes was diagnosed after 40 years of age who had a baseline mean blood pressure less than 107 mm Hg and albuminuria (albumin excretion < or = 30 mg/24 h). Enalapril, 10 mg/d, or placebo. Degree of albuminuria at 24 hours, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c values. Enalapril therapy decreased albumin excretion from a mean +/- SD of 11.6 +/- 7 mg/24 h to 9.7 +/- 6 mg/24 h at 2 years. This was followed by a gradual increase to 15.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h at 6 years. In the placebo group, albumin excretion increased from 10.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h to 26.5 +/- 10 mg/24 h at 6 years (P = 0.001 for enalapril compared with placebo). Transition to microalbuminuria occurred in 15 of 79 (19%) placebo recipients and 5 of 77 (6.5%) enalapril recipients. Enalapril treatment resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 12.5% (95% CI, 2% to 23%; P = 0.042) for development of microalbuminuria. After 6 years, creatinine clearance decreased from 1.78 +/- 0.13 mL/s to 1.63 +/- 0.12 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.025 mL/s per year) in enalapril recipients and from 1.81 +/- 0.15 mL/s to 1.57 +/- 0.17 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.04 mL/s per year) in placebo recipients (P = 0.040). Hemoglobin A1c values decreased modestly in both groups. Mean blood pressure remained normal (< 107 mm Hg) in all patients. Enalapril attenuated the decline in renal function and reduced the extent of albuminuria in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy.
Summary 1: A trial compared enalapril (Vasotec) 10 mg/d with placebo in 194 normotensive patients (aged 40-60) with type 2 diabetes and without microalbuminuria, defined as albumin excretion rate >30 mg/24 hr. Over the 6-year course of the study, the albumin excretion rate in the placebo group rose from 10.8 mg/24 hr to 26.5 mg/24 hr. The albumin excretion rate of the treatment group dropped from 11.6 mg/24 hr initially to 9.7 mg/24 hr at 2 years, then rose to 15.8 mg/24 hr at 6 years. Enalapril significantly slowed the rise in albumin excretion rate (RRR=0.4; P=.001). Nineteen percent of the placebo group developed microalbuminuria, compared with 6.5% of those taking enalapril (absolute risk reduction[ARR]=12.5%; number needed to treat=8; P=.042). While this study described a modest and statistically significant renal protective effect of enalapril, it did not use an intention-to-treat analysis.

Query 2: What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetes?
Document 2: Renal function declines progressively in patients who have diabetic nephropathy, and the decline may be slowed by antihypertensive drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether captopril has kidney-protecting properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy. We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing captopril with placebo in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom urinary protein excretion was > or = 500 mg per day and the serum creatinine concentration was < or = 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 mumol per liter). Blood-pressure goals were defined to achieve control during a median follow-up of three years. The primary end point was a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration. Two hundred seven patients received captopril, and 202 placebo. Serum creatinine concentrations doubled in 25 patients in the captopril group, as compared with 43 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.007). The associated reductions in risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration were 48 percent in the captopril group as a whole, 76 percent in the subgroup with a baseline serum creatinine concentration of 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mumol per liter), 55 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 mumol per liter), and 17 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.0 mg per deciliter (88.4 mumol per liter). The mean (+/- SD) rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 11 +/- 21 percent per year in the captopril group and 17 +/- 20 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.03). Among the patients whose base-line serum creatinine concentration was > or = 1.5 mg per deciliter, creatinine clearance declined at a rate of 23 +/- 25 percent per year in the captopril group and at a rate of 37 +/- 25 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Captopril treatment was associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of the combined end points of death, dialysis, and transplantation that was independent of the small disparity in blood pressure between the groups. Captopril protects against deterioration in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy and is significantly more effective than blood-pressure control alone.
Summary 2: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Query: Do ACE inhibitors prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetes without proteinuria?
Document: Renal disease in people with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) continues to pose a major health threat. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) slow the decline of renal function in advanced renal disease, but their effects at earlier stages are unclear, and the degree of albuminuria at which treatment should start is not known. We carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in 530 men and women with IDDM aged 20-59 years with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. Patients were recruited from 18 European centres, and were not on medication for hypertension. Resting blood pressure at entry was at least 75 and no more than 90 mm Hg diastolic, and no more than 155 mm Hg systolic. Urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) was centrally assessed by means of two overnight urine collections at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. There were no difference in baseline characteristics by treatment group; mean AER was 8.0 micrograms/min in both groups; and prevalence of microalbuminuria was 13% and 17% in the placebo and lisinopril groups, respectively. On intention-to-treat analysis at 2 years, AER was 2.2 micrograms/min lower in the lisinopril than in the placebo group, a percentage difference of 18.8% (95% CI 2.0-32.7, p = 0.03), adjusted for baseline AER and centre, absolute difference 2.2 micrograms/min. In people with normoalbuminuria, the treatment difference was 1.0 microgram/min (12.7% [-2.9 to 26.0], p = 0.1). In those with microalbuminuria, however, the treatment difference was 34.2 micrograms/min (49.7% [-14.5 to 77.9], p = 0.1; for interaction, p = 0.04). For patients who completed 24 months on the trial, the final treatment difference in AER was 38.5 micrograms/min in those with microalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.001), and 0.23 microgram/min in those with normoalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.6). There was no treatment difference in hypoglycaemic events or in metabolic control as assessed by glycated haemoglobin. Lisinopril slows the progression of renal disease in normotensive IDDM patients with little or no albuminuria, though greatest effect was in those with microalbuminuria (AER > or = 20 micrograms/min). Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM.
Summary:","There are 3 prospective randomized controlled trials studying the effect of ACE inhibitors on albumin excretion for patients with diabetes who do not have microalbuminuria. A 2-year randomized controlled trial compared lisinopril (Prinivil; Zestril) 10 mg/d with placebo in 530 normotensive adults (aged 20-59 years) with insulin-dependent diabetes, defined as those diagnosed with diabetes before age 36 and using continuous insulin therapy within 1 year of diagnosis. At the beginning of the study, 90 patients had microalbuminuria-defined as an albumin excretion rate (AER) >29 mg/24 hr-and 440 patients did not. When the results for all patients who had and did not have microalbuminuria were combined, there was a significantly smaller rise in the AER for the lisinopril group vs the placebo group (3.2 mg/24 hr lower; P=.03). However, for the patients without initial microalbuminuria, the reduction in the rise of AER with lisinopril was not significant (1.4 mg/24 hr lower; P=.10). The decreased rate of developing new microalbuminuria was also not significant (relative risk reduction [RRR]=12.7%; P=.10)."

Query 1: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document 1: To examine American beverage consumption trends and causes. Nationally representative data from the 1977-1978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, the 1989-1991 and 1994-1996 (also for children aged 2 to 9 years in 1998) Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII), and 1999-2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used in this study. The sample consisted of 73,345 individuals, aged >or=2 years. For each survey year, the percentage of total energy intake from meals and snacks was calculated separately for respondents aged 2 to 18 years, 19 to 39, 40 to 59, and >or=60. The percentage of energy intake by location (at home consumption or preparation, vending, store eaten out, restaurant/fast food, and school), as well as for specific beverages was computed separately for all age groups. The proportion consumed, mean portion size, and number of servings were calculated. For all age groups, sweetened beverage consumption increased and milk consumption decreased. Overall, energy intake from sweetened beverages increased 135% and was reduced by 38% from milk, with a 278 total calorie increase. These trends were associated with increased proportions of Americans consuming larger portions, more servings per day of sweetened beverage, and reductions in these same measures for milk. There is little research that has focused on the beneficial impacts of reduced soft drink and fruit drink intake. This would seem to be one of the simpler ways to reduce obesity in the United States.
Summary 1: Consumption of fruit drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages by American children has increased 135% since 1977; such drinks account for roughly 9% of daily energy intake.

Query 2: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document 2: To describe transitions and patterns in infants' and toddlers' beverage intakes, with focus on nonmilk beverages. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall of infants' and toddlers' food intakes, as reported by mothers or other primary caregivers. A nationwide sample of infants and toddlers (n=3,022) ages 4 to 24 months, who participated in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Beverages were categorized as total milks (ie, breast milk, infant formulas, cow's milk, soy milk, goat's milk), 100% juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and ""other."" Analyses included means +/- standard deviations, percentages, frequencies, nutrient densities, and linear regression. Beverages provided 84% of total daily food energy for infants 4 to 6 months of age, decreasing to 36% at ages 19 to 24 months. Apple juice and apple-flavored fruit drinks were the most frequently consumed beverages in the 100% juice and fruit drink categories, respectively. Juices, fruit drinks, and carbonated beverages appeared to displace milk in toddlers' diets (P<.0001). This research shows that beverages make important contributions to infants' and toddlers' energy and nutrient needs, but they must be wisely chosen. Registered dietitians should advise parents and caregivers that excessive intakes of any beverage, including milks and 100% juices, may displace other foods and beverages in the diet and/or contribute to excess food energy (kcal). Further research is needed to define excessive amounts in each beverage category, and such guidance could be very useful to parents and caregivers of infants and toddlers.
Summary 2: During the transition to table foods between 4 and 11 months of age, the top 3 nonmilk sources of carbohydrate in an infant's diet are infant cereal, 100% juice, and bananas.

Query: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document: To examine the relationship between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (eg, nondiet carbonated drinks and fruit drinks) and the prevalence of overweight among preschool-aged children living in Canada. Data come from the Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Québec (1998-2002). A representative sample (n=2,103) of children born in 1998 in Québec, Canada. A total of 1,944 children (still representative of the same-age children in this population) remaining at 4 to 5 years in 2002 participated in the nutrition study. Data were collected via 24-hour dietary recall interview. Frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals at age 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years was recorded and children's height and weight were measured. Multivariate regression analysis was done with Statistical Analysis System software. Weighted data were adjusted for within-child variability and significance level was set at 5%. Overall, 6.9% of children who were nonconsumers of sugar-sweetened beverages between meals between the ages of 2.5 to 4.5 years were overweight at 4.5 years, compared to 15.4% of regular consumers (four to six times or more per week) at ages 2.5 years, 3.5 years, and 4.5 years. According to multivariate analysis, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals more than doubles the odds of being overweight when other important factors are considered in multivariate analysis. Children from families with insufficient income who consume sugar-sweetened beverages regularly between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years are more than three times more likely to be overweight at age 4.5 years compared to nonconsuming children from sufficient income households. Regular sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals may put some young children at a greater risk for overweight. Parents should limit the quantity of sweetened beverages consumed during preschool years because it may increase propensity to gain weight.
Summary:",Cohort data show that children who regularly consume sugar-sweetened beverages are twice as likely to be overweight by 5 years of age as children who don't.

Query 1: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document 1: The obesity epidemic in the United States continues to increase. Because obesity tends to track over time, the increase in overweight among young children is of significant concern. A number of eating patterns have been associated with overweight among preschool-aged children. Recently, 100% fruit juice and sweetened fruit drinks have received considerable attention as potential sources of high-energy beverages that could be related to the prevalence of obesity among young children. Our aim was to evaluate the beverage intake among preschool children who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 and investigate associations between types and amounts of beverages consumed and weight status in preschool-aged children. We performed a secondary analysis of the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, which is a continuous, cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It included the collection of parent reported demographic descriptors, a 24-hour dietary recall, a measure of physical activity, and a standardized physical examination. The 24-hour dietary recall was obtained in person by a trained interviewer and reflected the foods and beverages that were consumed by the participant the previous day. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food groups were classified on the basis of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. We reviewed the main food descriptors used and classified all beverages listed. One hundred percent fruit juice was classified as only beverages that contained 100% fruit juice, without sweetener. Fruit drinks included any sweetened fruit juice, fruit-flavored drink (natural or artificial), or drink that contained fruit juice in part. Milk included any type of cow milk and then was subcategorized by percentage of milk fat. Any sweetened soft drink, caffeinated or uncaffeinated, was categorized as soda. Diet drinks included any fruit drink, tea, or soda that was sweetened by low-calorie sweetener. Several beverages were removed from the analysis because of low frequency of consumption among the sample. Water was not included in the analysis because it is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories. For the purposes of this analysis, the beverages were converted and reported as ounces, rather than grams, as reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to make it more clinically relevant. The child's BMI percentile for age and gender were calculated on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and used to identify children's weight status as underweight (< 5%), normal weight (5% to < 85%), at risk for overweight (85% to < 95%), or overweight (> or = 95%). Because of the small number of children in the underweight category, they were included in the normal-weight category for this analysis. Data were analyzed using SUDAAN 9.0.1 statistical software programs. SUDAAN allows for improved accuracy and validity of results by calculating test statistics for the stratified, multistage probability design of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sample weights were applied to all analyses to account for unequal probability of selection from oversampling low-income children and black and Mexican American children. Descriptive and chi2 analyses and analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, household income, energy intake, and physical activity, were conducted. All children who were aged 2 to 5 years were identified (N = 1572). Those with missing data were removed from additional analysis, resulting in a final sample of 1160 preschool children. Of the 1160 children analyzed, 579 (49.9%) were male. White children represented 35%, black children represented 28.3%, and Hispanic children represented 36.7% of the sample. Twenty-four percent of the children were overweight or at risk for overweight (BMI > or = 85%), and 10.7% were overweight (BMI > or = 95%). There were no statistically significant differences in BMI between boys and girls or among the ethnicities. Overweight children tended to be older (mean age: 3.83 years) compared with the normal-weight children (mean age: 3.48 years). Eighty-three percent of children drank milk, 48% drank 100% fruit juice, 44% drank fruit drink, and 39% drank soda. Whole milk was consumed by 46.5% of the children, and 3.1% and 5.5% of the children consumed skim milk and 1% milk, respectively. Preschool children consumed a mean total beverage volume of 26.93 oz/day, which included 12.32 oz of milk, 4.70 oz of 100% fruit juice, 4.98 oz of fruit drinks, and 3.25 oz of soda. Weight status of the child had no association with the amount of total beverages, milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. There was no clinically significant association between the types of milk (percentage of fat) consumed and weight status. In analysis of covariance, daily total energy intake increased with increased consumption of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drinks, and soda. However, there was not a statistically significant increase in BMI on the basis of quantity of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. On average, preschool children drank less milk than the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation of 16 oz/day. Only 8.6% drank low-fat or skim milk, as recommended for children who are older than 2 years. On average, preschool children drank < 6 oz/day 100% fruit juice. Increased beverage consumption was associated with an increase in the total energy intake of the children but not with their BMI. Prospectively studying preschool children beyond 2 to 5 years of age, through their adiposity rebound (approximately 5.5-6 years) to determine whether there is a trajectory increase in their BMI, may help to clarify the role of beverage consumption in total energy intake and weight status.
Summary 1: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that overweight children and adolescents consume more sugar-sweetened beverages than those who are not overweight.

Document 2: To examine American beverage consumption trends and causes. Nationally representative data from the 1977-1978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, the 1989-1991 and 1994-1996 (also for children aged 2 to 9 years in 1998) Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII), and 1999-2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used in this study. The sample consisted of 73,345 individuals, aged >or=2 years. For each survey year, the percentage of total energy intake from meals and snacks was calculated separately for respondents aged 2 to 18 years, 19 to 39, 40 to 59, and >or=60. The percentage of energy intake by location (at home consumption or preparation, vending, store eaten out, restaurant/fast food, and school), as well as for specific beverages was computed separately for all age groups. The proportion consumed, mean portion size, and number of servings were calculated. For all age groups, sweetened beverage consumption increased and milk consumption decreased. Overall, energy intake from sweetened beverages increased 135% and was reduced by 38% from milk, with a 278 total calorie increase. These trends were associated with increased proportions of Americans consuming larger portions, more servings per day of sweetened beverage, and reductions in these same measures for milk. There is little research that has focused on the beneficial impacts of reduced soft drink and fruit drink intake. This would seem to be one of the simpler ways to reduce obesity in the United States.
Summary 2: Consumption of fruit drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages by American children has increased 135% since 1977; such drinks account for roughly 9% of daily energy intake.

Query: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document: In a referral population of young children, excessive fruit juice consumption has been reported to be a contributing factor in nonorganic failure to thrive. To evaluate, in a population-based sample of healthy children, fruit juice consumption and its effects on growth parameters during early childhood. Cross-sectional study. General primary care health center in upstate New York. One hundred sixteen 2-year-old children and one hundred seven 5-year-old children, who were scheduled for a nonacute visit, and their primary care taker/parent were recruited over a 2-year period. For 168 children (ninety-four 2-year-old children and seventy-four 5-year-old children), mean dietary intake was calculated from 7 days of written dietary records, entered, and analyzed using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System. Height was measured using a Harpenden Stadiometer. Weight was measured using a standard balance beam scale. The 2-year-old and 5-year-old children consumed, on average, 5.9 and 5.0 fl oz/day of fruit juice and 9.8 and 11.0 fl oz/day of milk, respectively. Nineteen children (11%) consumed > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice. Forty-two percent of children consuming > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice had short stature (height less than 20th sex-specific percentile for age) vs 14% of children drinking less than 12 fl oz/day of juice. Obesity was more common among children drinking > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice compared with those drinking less juice: 53% vs 32% had a body mass index > or = 75th age- and sex-specific percentile; 32% vs 9% had a body mass index > or = 90th age- and sex-specific percentile; and 32% vs 5% had a ponderal index > or = 90th age-specific percentile. After adjustment for maternal height, child age, child sex, and child age-sex interaction, children consuming > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice, compared with those drinking less than 12 fl oz/day of juice, were shorter (86.5 vs 89.3 cm and 106.5 vs 111.2 cm for the 2-year-old and 5-year-old children, respectively) and more overweight (body mass index = 17.2 vs 16.3 kg/m2 and ponderal index = 18.4 vs 16.8 kg/m3). Consumption of > or = 12 fl oz/day of fruit juice by young children was associated with short stature and with obesity. Parents and care takers should limit young children's consumption of fruit juice to less than 12 fl oz/day.
Summary:","The role of fruit juice consumption in childhood obesity is controversial. In 1 group of 168 children 2 to 5 years of age, 9% of children who drank >12 oz of fruit juice per day were overweight, compared with 3% of those who drank <12 oz daily."

Document 1: To describe transitions and patterns in infants' and toddlers' beverage intakes, with focus on nonmilk beverages. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall of infants' and toddlers' food intakes, as reported by mothers or other primary caregivers. A nationwide sample of infants and toddlers (n=3,022) ages 4 to 24 months, who participated in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Beverages were categorized as total milks (ie, breast milk, infant formulas, cow's milk, soy milk, goat's milk), 100% juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and ""other."" Analyses included means +/- standard deviations, percentages, frequencies, nutrient densities, and linear regression. Beverages provided 84% of total daily food energy for infants 4 to 6 months of age, decreasing to 36% at ages 19 to 24 months. Apple juice and apple-flavored fruit drinks were the most frequently consumed beverages in the 100% juice and fruit drink categories, respectively. Juices, fruit drinks, and carbonated beverages appeared to displace milk in toddlers' diets (P<.0001). This research shows that beverages make important contributions to infants' and toddlers' energy and nutrient needs, but they must be wisely chosen. Registered dietitians should advise parents and caregivers that excessive intakes of any beverage, including milks and 100% juices, may displace other foods and beverages in the diet and/or contribute to excess food energy (kcal). Further research is needed to define excessive amounts in each beverage category, and such guidance could be very useful to parents and caregivers of infants and toddlers.
Summary 1: During the transition to table foods between 4 and 11 months of age, the top 3 nonmilk sources of carbohydrate in an infant's diet are infant cereal, 100% juice, and bananas.

Document 2: To assess adherence to infant feeding recommendations among a sample of infants and toddlers four to 24 months of age in the United States. Descriptive analysis of data collected in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) based on telephone interviews and 24-hour dietary recalls collected with the Nutrition Data System for Research of the University of Minnesota. A national random sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers age four to 24 months, including 2,024 infants age four to 11 months. Breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods, and adherence to infant feeding recommendations. Means and standard errors, percentile distributions, and percentages by age group (four to six months, seven to eight months, and nine to 11 months). About 76% of infants and toddlers were fully or partly breastfed at birth. This percentage declined to 30% at six months and 16% at 12 months-short of Healthy People 2010 goals of 50% and 25%, respectively. The average duration of breastfeeding was 5.5 months for all who initiated breastfeeding. About two-thirds of infants had been introduced to complementary foods between four and six months-the period recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); 17% consumed juice before the AAP recommended age of six months or later. Twenty-two percent of infants nine to 11 months consumed cow's milk on a daily basis before the recommended age of 12 months or later, and one in 10 consumed french fries and/or sweetened beverages on any given day. More parents and caregivers can benefit from guidance about the introduction of developmentally appropriate, micronutrient-rich first solid foods such as iron-rich infant cereals, iron-fortified grain products, meats, soft fruits, and cooked vegetables and the importance of breastfeeding through the first year of life. A smaller proportion of parents and caregivers require guidance on delaying the introduction of juices until six months of age and cow's milk other than formula until one year of age.
Summary 2: One in 5 infants routinely drinks juice before 6 months of age.

Summary:","Overweight children are more likely than normal-weight children to be overweight as adults; they're at significant risk for morbidity and mortality from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in adulthood. Establishing sound nutritional habits-including appropriate consumption of fruit juices, fruit drinks, and other sugar-sweetened beverages-early in life plays an important role in preventing overweight in later childhood and adulthood."

Query 1: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document 1: The obesity epidemic in the United States continues to increase. Because obesity tends to track over time, the increase in overweight among young children is of significant concern. A number of eating patterns have been associated with overweight among preschool-aged children. Recently, 100% fruit juice and sweetened fruit drinks have received considerable attention as potential sources of high-energy beverages that could be related to the prevalence of obesity among young children. Our aim was to evaluate the beverage intake among preschool children who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 and investigate associations between types and amounts of beverages consumed and weight status in preschool-aged children. We performed a secondary analysis of the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, which is a continuous, cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It included the collection of parent reported demographic descriptors, a 24-hour dietary recall, a measure of physical activity, and a standardized physical examination. The 24-hour dietary recall was obtained in person by a trained interviewer and reflected the foods and beverages that were consumed by the participant the previous day. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food groups were classified on the basis of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. We reviewed the main food descriptors used and classified all beverages listed. One hundred percent fruit juice was classified as only beverages that contained 100% fruit juice, without sweetener. Fruit drinks included any sweetened fruit juice, fruit-flavored drink (natural or artificial), or drink that contained fruit juice in part. Milk included any type of cow milk and then was subcategorized by percentage of milk fat. Any sweetened soft drink, caffeinated or uncaffeinated, was categorized as soda. Diet drinks included any fruit drink, tea, or soda that was sweetened by low-calorie sweetener. Several beverages were removed from the analysis because of low frequency of consumption among the sample. Water was not included in the analysis because it is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories. For the purposes of this analysis, the beverages were converted and reported as ounces, rather than grams, as reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to make it more clinically relevant. The child's BMI percentile for age and gender were calculated on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and used to identify children's weight status as underweight (< 5%), normal weight (5% to < 85%), at risk for overweight (85% to < 95%), or overweight (> or = 95%). Because of the small number of children in the underweight category, they were included in the normal-weight category for this analysis. Data were analyzed using SUDAAN 9.0.1 statistical software programs. SUDAAN allows for improved accuracy and validity of results by calculating test statistics for the stratified, multistage probability design of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sample weights were applied to all analyses to account for unequal probability of selection from oversampling low-income children and black and Mexican American children. Descriptive and chi2 analyses and analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, household income, energy intake, and physical activity, were conducted. All children who were aged 2 to 5 years were identified (N = 1572). Those with missing data were removed from additional analysis, resulting in a final sample of 1160 preschool children. Of the 1160 children analyzed, 579 (49.9%) were male. White children represented 35%, black children represented 28.3%, and Hispanic children represented 36.7% of the sample. Twenty-four percent of the children were overweight or at risk for overweight (BMI > or = 85%), and 10.7% were overweight (BMI > or = 95%). There were no statistically significant differences in BMI between boys and girls or among the ethnicities. Overweight children tended to be older (mean age: 3.83 years) compared with the normal-weight children (mean age: 3.48 years). Eighty-three percent of children drank milk, 48% drank 100% fruit juice, 44% drank fruit drink, and 39% drank soda. Whole milk was consumed by 46.5% of the children, and 3.1% and 5.5% of the children consumed skim milk and 1% milk, respectively. Preschool children consumed a mean total beverage volume of 26.93 oz/day, which included 12.32 oz of milk, 4.70 oz of 100% fruit juice, 4.98 oz of fruit drinks, and 3.25 oz of soda. Weight status of the child had no association with the amount of total beverages, milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. There was no clinically significant association between the types of milk (percentage of fat) consumed and weight status. In analysis of covariance, daily total energy intake increased with increased consumption of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drinks, and soda. However, there was not a statistically significant increase in BMI on the basis of quantity of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. On average, preschool children drank less milk than the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation of 16 oz/day. Only 8.6% drank low-fat or skim milk, as recommended for children who are older than 2 years. On average, preschool children drank < 6 oz/day 100% fruit juice.

Document: The prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults in the United States has increased over several decades. To provide current estimates of the prevalence and trends of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. Analysis of height and weight measurements from 3958 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years and 4431 adults aged 20 years or older obtained in 2003-2004 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2002 were compared with data from 2003-2004. Estimates of the prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. Overweight among children and adolescents was defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; extreme obesity was defined as a BMI of 40 or higher. In 2003-2004, 17.1% of US children and adolescents were overweight and 32.2% of adults were obese. Tests for trend were significant for male and female children and adolescents, indicating an increase in the prevalence of overweight in female children and adolescents from 13.8% in 1999-2000 to 16.0% in 2003-2004 and an increase in the prevalence of overweight in male children and adolescents from 14.0% to 18.2%. Among men, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly between 1999-2000 (27.5%) and 2003-2004 (31.1%). Among women, no significant increase in obesity was observed between 1999-2000 (33.4%) and 2003-2004 (33.2%). The prevalence of extreme obesity (body mass index > or =40) in 2003-2004 was 2.8% in men and 6.9% in women. In 2003-2004, significant differences in obesity prevalence remained by race/ethnicity and by age. Approximately 30% of non-Hispanic white adults were obese as were 45.0% of non-Hispanic black adults and 36.8% of Mexican Americans. Among adults aged 20 to 39 years, 28.5% were obese while 36.8% of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0% of those aged 60 years or older were obese in 2003-2004. The prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents and obesity among men increased significantly during the 6-year period from 1999 to 2004; among women, no overall increases in the prevalence of obesity were observed. These estimates were based on a 6-year period and suggest that the increases in body weight are continuing in men and in children and adolescents while they may be leveling off in women.
Summary:",One of every 6 American children is overweight or at risk of becoming overweight.

Query 1: When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice?
Document 1: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), particularly carbonated soft drinks, may be a key contributor to the epidemic of overweight and obesity, by virtue of these beverages' high added sugar content, low satiety, and incomplete compensation for total energy. Whether an association exists between SSB intake and weight gain is unclear. We searched English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through May 2005 for cross-sectional, prospective cohort, and experimental studies of the relation between SSBs and the risk of weight gain (ie, overweight, obesity, or both). Thirty publications (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective, and 5 experimental) were selected on the basis of relevance and quality of design and methods. Findings from large cross-sectional studies, in conjunction with those from well-powered prospective cohort studies with long periods of follow-up, show a positive association between greater intakes of SSBs and weight gain and obesity in both children and adults. Findings from short-term feeding trials in adults also support an induction of positive energy balance and weight gain by intake of sugar-sweetened sodas, but these trials are few. A school-based intervention found significantly less soft-drink consumption and prevalence of obese and overweight children in the intervention group than in control subjects after 12 mo, and a recent 25-week randomized controlled trial in adolescents found further evidence linking SSB intake to body weight. The weight of epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates that a greater consumption of SSBs is associated with weight gain and obesity. Although more research is needed, sufficient evidence exists for public health strategies to discourage consumption of sugary drinks as part of a healthy lifestyle.
Summary 1: A recent systematic review of 30 studies (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective cohort, and 5 experimental trials) supports a link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and childhood obesity.

Document: We assessed whether sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption increases fatness in British children. Data from a subsample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were analyzed. Diet was assessed at ages 5 y (n = 521) and 7 y (n = 682) using 3-d diet diaries. Beverages were categorized into SSB, low energy, fruit juice, milk, and water. Fat mass was measured at age 9 y using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The association between consumption of SSB at each age and fatness was examined using linear regression adjusted for potentially confounding variables. SSB accounted for 15% of all drinks consumed and 3% of total energy intake at both ages. There was no evidence of an association between SSB consumption at 5 or 7 y of age and fatness at age 9 y. There was a small positive correlation between low-energy drinks at age 5 and 7 y and fatness at 9 y (age 5 y, rho = 0.21, P < 0.001; age 7 y, rho = 0.16, P < 0.001), which was explained by existing overweight status at ages 5 and 7 y. In this cohort of British children there was no evidence of an association between SSB consumption at age 5 or 7 y and fatness at age 9 y. The positive relation between consumption of low-energy beverages and fatness at 9 y, which was explained by overweight status at 5 and 7 y, suggests that heavier children may consume low-energy beverages as part of an ineffective weight-control program.
Summary:",1 cohort of 521 children followed longitudinally from 5 to 9 years showed no association between sugar-sweetened beverage intake and body fat.

Query 1: Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers?
Document 1: To review the literature on nipple pain and to delineate effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of nipple pain in breastfeeding mothers. Computerized searches on MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Articles from indexed journals relevant to the objective were reviewed from January 1983 to April 2004. Preference was given to research-based studies in English. Data were extracted and organized under two headings: prevention of nipple pain or trauma and treatment of nipple pain or trauma. The Critical Appraisal Form by J. Briggs was used to extract the data from research-based articles. The health benefits of breastfeeding for mother and infant are well documented; however, nipple pain is a common reason reported by women for the early termination of breastfeeding. Several studies have compared various treatments for either the prevention of or treatment for nipple pain. These treatments include warm water compresses, tea bag compresses, heat, application of expressed mother's milk, lanolin, vitamin A, collagenase, dexpanthenol, hydrogel therapy, glycerin gel therapy, moist occlusive dressing, education regarding proper latch-on and positioning, and no treatment. No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.
Summary 1: Two studies of educational sessions, 1 antenatal (N=75) and 1 immediately postnatal (N=160), reported less nipple pain in the intervention groups (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.6 and 5.6, respectively). The antenatal education study demonstrated higher continuation of breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum in the intervention group (NNT=4.5), whereas the postnatal study showed no significant difference in continuation of breastfeeding in the intervention group at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.
Summary:",Breast shields were ineffective in 1 RCT.

Query 1: Does birth weight predict childhood obesity?
Document 1: Obesity increases risk of many adverse outcomes, but its early origins are obscure. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) reflects a metabolically altered fetal environment associated with high birth weight, itself associated with later obesity. Previous studies of GDM and offspring obesity, however, have been few and conflicting. The objectives of this study were to examine associations of birth weight and GDM with adolescent body mass index (BMI) and to determine the extent to which the effect of GDM is explained by its influence on birth weight or by maternal adiposity. We conducted a survey of 7981 girls and 6900 boys, 9 to 14 years of age, who are participants in the Growing Up Today Study, a US nationwide study of diet, activity, and growth. In 1996, participants reported height, weight, diet, activity, and other variables by self-administered mailed questionnaire. We linked these data with information reported by their mothers, participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, including GDM, height, current weight, and child's birth weight. We excluded births <34 weeks' gestation and mothers who had preexisting diabetes. We defined overweight as BMI (kg/m(2)) >95th percentile, and at risk for overweight as 85th to 95th percentile, for age and gender from US national data. Mean birth weight was 3.4 kg for girls and 3.6 kg for boys. Among the 465 subjects whose mothers had GDM, 17.1% were at risk for overweight and 9.7% were overweight in early adolescence. In the group without maternal diabetes, these estimates were 14.2% and 6.6%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, gender, and Tanner stage, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight for each 1-kg increment in birth weight was 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.6). Adjustment for physical activity, television watching, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, mother's BMI, and other maternal and family variables reduced the estimate to 1.3 (1.1-1.5). For offspring of mothers with GDM versus no diabetes, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (1.1-2.0), which was unchanged after controlling for energy balance and socioeconomic factors. Adjustment for birth weight slightly attenuated the estimate (1.3; 0.9-1.9); adjustment for maternal BMI reduced the odds ratio to 1.2 (0.8-1.7). Higher birth weight predicted increased risk of overweight in adolescence. Having been born to a mother with GDM was also associated with increased adolescent overweight. However, the effect of GDM on offspring obesity seemed only partially explained by its influence on birth weight, and adjustment for mother's own BMI attenuated the GDM associations. Our results only modestly support a causal role of altered maternal-fetal glucose metabolism in the genesis of obesity in the offspring. Alternatively, GDM may program risk for a postnatal insult leading to obesity, or it may merely be a risk marker, not in the causal pathway.
Summary 1: A retrospective cohort survey of 14,881 children born to mothers with gestational diabetes-and controlled for age, sex, and Tanner stage-found that the odds ratio (OR) for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6) for each 1-kg increment in birth weight. The correlation persisted (OR=1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) when other covariates were controlled (television viewing, physical activity, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, birth order, household income, mother's smoking, dietary restraint, and mother's current BMI).

Query 2: Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child?
Document 2: The association between early life factors and body mass index (BMI) in adulthood has been demonstrated in developed countries. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of early life factors (birth weight, gestational age, maternal smoking, and social class) on BMI in young adulthood with adjustment for adult socioeconomic position. A cohort study was carried out in 1978/79 with 6827 mother-child pairs from Ribeirão Preto city, located in the most developed economic area of the country. Biological, economic and social variables and newborn anthropometric measurements were obtained shortly after delivery. In 1996, 1189 males from this cohort, 34.3% of the original male population, were submitted to anthropometric measurements and were asked about their current schooling on the occasion of army recruitment. A multiple linear regression model was applied to determine variables associated with BMI. Mean BMI was 22.7 (95%CI = 22.5-23.0). After adjustment, BMI was 1.22 kg/m(2) higher among infants born with high birth weight ( > or = 4000 g), 1.21 kg/m(2) higher among individuals of low social class at birth and 0.69 kg/m(2) higher among individuals whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The association between social class at birth and BMI remained statistically significant (P < 0.05) even after adjustment for adult schooling. These findings suggest that early life social influences on BMI were more important and were not reversed by late socioeconomic position. Therefore, prevention of overweight and obesity should focus not only on changes in adult life styles but also on factors such as high birth weight.
Summary 2: A Brazilian study found that children born in the lowest socioeconomic group had body mass index measurements at 18 years of age that were an average of 1.21 kg/m2 higher than children in the highest socioeconomic group (P<.05). The study controlled for birth weight, maternal smoking, gestational age, and level of schooling eventually achieved by the child.

Query: Does birth weight predict childhood obesity?
Document: To identify factors in childhood which might influence the development of obesity in adulthood. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the UK and other developed countries, in adults and children. The adverse health consequences of adult obesity are well documented, but are less certain for childhood obesity. An association between fatness in adolescence and undesirable socio-economic consequences, such as lower educational attainment and income, has been observed, particularly for women. Childhood factors implicated in the development of adult obesity therefore have far-reaching implications for costs to the health-services and economy. In order to identify relevant studies, electronic databases--Medline, Embase, CAB abstracts, Psyclit and Sport Discus-were searched from the start date of the database to Spring 1998. The general search structure for electronic databases was (childhood or synonyms) AND (fatness or synonyms) AND (longitudinal or synonyms). Further studies were identified by citations in retrieved papers and by consultation with experts. Longitudinal observational studies of healthy children which included measurement of a risk factor in childhood (<18 y), and outcome measure at least 1 y later. Any measure of fatness, leanness or change in fatness or leanness was accepted. Measures of fat distribution were not included. Only studies with participants from an industrialized country were considered, and those concerning minority or special groups, e.g. Pima Indians or children born preterm, were excluded. Risk factors for obesity included parental fatness, social factors, birth weight, timing or rate of maturation, physical activity, dietary factors and other behavioural or psychological factors. Offspring of obese parent(s) were consistently seen to be at increased risk of fatness, although few studies have looked at this relationship over longer periods of childhood and into adulthood. The relative contributions of genes and inherited lifestyle factors to the parent-child fatness association remain largely unknown. No clear relationship is reported between socio-economic status (SES) in early life and childhood fatness. However, a strong consistent relationship is observed between low SES in early life and increased fatness in adulthood. Studies investigating SES were generally large but very few considered confounding by parental fatness. Women who change social class (social mobility) show the prevalence of obesity of the class they join, an association which is not present in men. The influence of other social factors such as family size, number of parents at home and childcare have been little researched. There is good evidence from large and reasonably long-term studies for an apparently clear relationship for increased fatness with higher birth weight, but in studies which attempted to address potential confounding by gestational age, parental fatness, or social group, the relationship was less consistent. The relationship between earlier maturation and greater subsequent fatness was investigated in predominantly smaller, but also a few large studies. Again, this relationship appeared to be consistent, but in general, the studies had not investigated whether there was confounding by other factors, including parental fatness, SES, earlier fatness in childhood, or dietary or activity behaviours. Studies investigating the role of diet or activity were generally small, and included diverse methods of risk factor measurement. There was almost no evidence for an influence of activity in infancy on later fatness, and inconsistent but suggestive evidence for a protective effect of activity in childhood on later fatness. No clear evidence for an effect of infant feeding on later fatness emerged, but follow-up to adulthood was rare, with only one study measuring fatness after 7y. Studies investigating diet in childhood were limited and inconc
Summary:","A systematic review of 19 longitudinal, observational studies comparing birth weight with later BMI indicates that the association between the 2 is positive and consistent in multiple cohorts. Eleven studies focused on outcomes in childhood; another 8 measured outcomes into adulthood. Fifteen of the 19 studies (79%), ranging in size from 1028 to 92,940 subjects, found a positive association between birth weight and later BMI. However, the data were too heterogeneous to combine into a single summary measure. One representative study quantified the relative risk (RR) for severe obesity (>95th percentile BMI) at 5 years of age as 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.9) for birth weights between the 85th and 94th percentiles and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-2.9) for birth weights greater than the 95th percentile. Studies that didn't find such an association had smaller sample sizes (137 to 432 subjects) and, therefore, may have lacked the power to detect an association."

Query 1: What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive?
Document 1: Failure to thrive is a common problem in infancy and childhood. It is most often multifactorial in origin. Inadequate nutrition and disturbed social interactions contribute to poor weight gain, delayed development, and abnormal behavior. The syndrome develops in a significant number of children as a consequence of child neglect. This clinical report is intended to focus the pediatrician on the consideration, evaluation, and management of failure to thrive when child neglect may be present. Child protective services agencies should be notified when the evaluation leads to a suspicion of abuse or neglect.
Summary 1: A detailed prenatal history (including birth weight and pregnancy complications) and medical history for both the child and parents can identify underlying metabolic, endocrine, or familial disorders. It is always important to look for signs of child abuse, because children with failure to thrive are more likely to be victims of abuse than normal-weight peers.

Query 2: What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive?
Document 2: To ascertain the long term outcomes in children diagnosed as having failure to thrive (FTT). Systematic review of cohort studies. Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane, and DARE databases were searched for potentially relevant studies. Inclusion criteria: cohort studies or randomised controlled trials in children <2 years old with failure to thrive defined as weight <10th centile or lower centile and/or weight velocity <10th centile, with growth, development, or behaviour measured at 3 years of age or older. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria; eight included a comparison group, of which five included children identified in community settings. Two were randomised controlled trials. Attrition rates were 10-30%. Data from population based studies with comparison groups and which reported comparable outcomes in an appropriate form were pooled in a random effects meta-analysis. Four studies report IQ scores at follow up and the pooled standardised mean difference was -0.22 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.03). Two studies reported growth data as standard deviation scores. Their pooled weighted mean difference for weight was -1.24 SDS (95% CI -2.00 to -0.48), and for height -0.87 SDS (95% CI -1.47 to -0.28). No studies corrected for parental height, but two reported that parents of index children were shorter. The IQ difference (equivalent to approximately 3 IQ points) is of questionable clinical significance. The height and weight differences are larger, but few children were below the 3rd centile at follow up. It is unclear to what extent observed differences reflect causal relations or confounding due to other variables. In the light of these results the aggressive approach to identification and management of failure to thrive needs reassessing.
Summary 2: failure to thrive occurs when nutritive intake is insufficient to meet demands for growth. It is usually manifested by failure to gain weight. In more severe cases, height and head circumference are affected. failure to thrive is also associated with lower developmental testing scores.

Query 1: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 1: Giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis are prevalent in many parts of the world. Application of a single drug for treatment of both giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis is highly desirable. One hundred children of both sexes, ranging from 7 to 12 years old with Giardia intestinalis cysts or trophozoites in their stool samples, were randomly separated into two groups of 50 individuals each. Each group received either mebendazole tablets 200 mg thrice daily for 5 days or metronidazole tablet 15 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, for 7 days. The results were evaluated by microscopic examination of stools on two successive occasions: 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment. Each occasion consisted of three stool examination on 3 successive days. The cure rate of mebendazole-treated children was 43 out of 50 (86 per cent), and for metronidazole it was 45 out of 50 (90 per cent) with no statistical difference between the two groups. No side-effects were observed in the mebendazole-treated group, whereas nausea, anorexia and metallic taste were observed in 4.9, 6 and 24 per cent of metronidazole-treated children, respectively. In conclusion, the use of mebendazole, which is less toxic with no side-effects, is available and effective on Giardia intestinalis as well as intestinal nematodes, is recommended especially in the areas where giardiasis and intestinal nematodiasis are prevalent and overlap.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials comparing 5 days of mebendazole with 7 days of metronidazole in 7- to 12-year-old Iranian children showed no statistical difference in microbiologic cure between the 2 regimens.

Query 2: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 2: There can be a high rate of recurrence of disease after initial drug treatment for giardiasis. These drugs also have a range of adverse effects. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of drug treatments for giardiasis. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, Current Contents, reference lists of articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of drug therapy for giardiasis compared with placebo or another drug. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Thirty-four trials were included. Only one trial was without serious methodological flaws. Compared with placebo, drug treatment was associated with an improved cure rate (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 58). Metronidazole treatment longer than three days had a better parasitological cure rate than other long treatment courses (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. Single dose therapy appeared equally effective as longer treatment courses (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.34). Within the single dose regimens, tinidazole had a comparable parasitological cure rate to other short therapies (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 12), but had a higher clinical cure rate (odds ratio 5.3, 95% 2.7-10.7). A single dose of tinidazole appears to give the highest clinical cure rate for giardiasis with relatively few adverse effects.
Summary 2: A 2006 Cochrane Review found no difference in clinical cure rate between short-term treatment (3 days) with metronidazole and longer therapy with metronidazole or other drugs. Subsequently, a single dose of metronidazole was found to be as effective as treatment for 5 days or longer (OR=0.33, 95% CI 0.08-1.34).

Document: A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide in the treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia intestinalis or Entamoeba histolytica and/or E. dispar in 89 adults and adolescents, 22 of whom were diagnosed with G. intestinalis, 53 with E. histolytica and/or E. dispar, and 14 with both G. intestinalis and E. histolytica and/or E. dispar. The study medication was administered as 1 nitazoxanide 500-mg tablet or a matching placebo twice daily for 3 days. Thirty-eight (81%) of 47 patients in the nitazoxanide treatment group resolved diarrhea within 7 days (median, 3 days) after initiation of treatment, versus 17 (40%) of 42 in the placebo group (P=.0002). With its efficacy in treating a broad spectrum of enteric protozoan pathogens, nitazoxanide could play an important role in the management of diarrhea caused by enteric protozoa, reducing morbidity and costs associated with these diarrheal illnesses.
Summary:",Two RCTs found nitazoxanide to be effective (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.82) compared to placebo in adolescents and adults.

Query 2: What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis?
Document 2: To compare the efficacy and safety of five days apostrophe therapy of mebendazole (MBZ) versus quinacrine (QC) on human giardiasis in children. A clinical trial was carried out in paediatric patients (aged 5-15 years) with confirmed symptomatic G. duodenalis mono-infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either MBZ [200 mg taken three times per day (TID) (n = 61)] or QC [2 mg/kg bodyweight tid (n = 61)], both for five days. Follow-up faecal samples were obtained at 3, 5 and 7 d after the end of the treatment. Although the frequency of cure was higher for QC (83.6%) than for MBZ (78.7%), the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Adverse events were reported more in the QC group (P < 0.05), all of them transient and self-limiting. Despite final cure rates ocurring lower than expected, the overall results of this study reconfirmed the efficacy of MBZ in giardiasis and also indicate that, although comparable to QC, at least in this setting the 5 d course of MBZ did not appear to improve the cure rates in this intestinal parasitic infection.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials in Cuban children 5 to 15 years of age found no difference in clinical cure rate between a 5-day course of mebendazole and more traditional therapy with quinacrine.

Document: Enteric infection by Giardia intestinalis is a common cause of diarrhoea world-wide and a significant cause of morbidity in children. To compare the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide and metronidazole in the treatment of diarrhoea caused by G. intestinalis in children. A total of 110 children presenting with diarrhoea caused by G. intestinalis were randomized to treatment with either a 3-day course of nitazoxanide (100 mg b.d., age range 2-3 years; 200 mg b.d., age range 4-11 years) or a 5-day course of metronidazole (125 mg b.d., age range 2-5 years; 250 mg b.d., age range 6-11 years). The patients were followed-up for a determination of clinical response 7 days after the initiation of treatment, and two subsequent stool samples were collected for parasitological examination. Diarrhoea had resolved in 47 children out of 55 (85%) in the nitazoxanide treatment group before the day 7 follow-up visit, compared to 44 out of 55 (80%) for metronidazole. Diarrhoea resolved within 4 days in most cases. Only mild, transient adverse events were reported. A 3-day course of nitazoxanide suspension is as efficacious as a standard 5-day course of metronidazole suspension in treating giardiasis in children.
Summary:","A 3-day course of nitazoxanide was as effective as 5 days of metronidazole (80% vs 85%, P=0.61) in resolving clinical giardiasis."

Query 1: How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics?
Document 1: Thirty-five patients with mild hypertension (WHO Class I) participated in a double-blind cross-over study involving two 8-week periods of treatment with cilazapril 2.5-5 mg once daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg once daily, in each case preceded by a 4-week placebo period. Thirty-two patients completed the study, the aim of which was to compare the effects of the drugs on serum electrolyte levels, left ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias, as assessed by echocardiography and 48-h Holter monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.01) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures (comparisons with placebo periods). Cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide had opposite effects on ventricular ectopic activity. The beneficial effect of cilazapril on ventricular extrasystole counts correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with the reduction of left ventricular mass index. Hydrochlorothiazide had no effects on left ventricular mass or diastolic function. Serum potassium values were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by hydrochlorothiazide but there was no correlation between changes in potassium levels and changes in ventricular ectopic activity. The results of the study suggest that hydrochlorothiazide and cilazapril were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, but only cilazapril reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and suppressed ventricular ectopic activity.
Summary 1: Recent studies have found that hydrochlorothiazide in doses above 12.5 to 25 mg do not result in significantly lower blood pressure and only lead to more electrolyte abnormalities.

Query 2: How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics?
Document 2: Among 54 patients attending a hospital hypertension clinic and receiving the fixed-combination diuretic Moduretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg, amiloride 5 mg), there was a 44.4% incidence of hypokalaemia. The mean drop in plasma potassium level was 0.69 mmol/L (P less than 0.0001), the mean low level being 2.81 mmol/L. Seventy-four per cent of falls occurred within 52 weeks of the start of therapy, 19.5 weeks being the average period between a normal and a low plasma potassium level. There was no difference in the fall in potassium level between male and female subjects, and beta-blockers were not obviously protective, although there was a statistically significant smaller fall in potassium level in females treated with them. The clinical significance of the unexpected hypokalaemia is uncertain; but even with fixed-combination diuretics, it remains necessary to monitor the plasma potassium level regularly in order to avoid complicating situations. The results of the present study would cast doubt on the efficacy of 5 mg of amiloride with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in fixed-combination form in preventing hypokalaemia in this clinical situation.
Summary 2: Penhall and coworkers found hypokalemia in 24 of 54 patients receiving a fixed-combination diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and potassium-sparing amiloride 5 mg). Note that the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was higher in this study than is generally used today.

Query: How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics?
Document: Nineteen men with mild to moderate hypertension and without a history of cardiac arrhythmias were randomized (double-blind) into groups to receive hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at a dose of 25 mg/day, HCTZ at 50 mg/day, or HCTZ (25 mg) plus triamterene (50 mg) for a six-month period after a three-week (single-blind) placebo period. Serum electrolyte values were determined at baseline and at frequent intervals thereafter. Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline and just before study termination. Mild hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in approximately half of the patients and was unrelated to treatment group. Serious arrhythmias were infrequent, though some patients had large numbers of extra beats. The incidence of arrhythmia appeared unrelated to serum potassium concentration. We conclude that mild hypokalemia associated with low-dose diuretic therapy for hypertension is not arrhythmogenic.
Summary:",The time period required to develop hypokalemia can be (1 week).

Query 1: What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction?
Document 1: The authors compared low-dose sustained-release bupropion with placebo for sexual dysfunction induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Thirty adults who had received SSRIs for at least 6 weeks, who were euthymic, and who had sexual dysfunction as determined by a total score greater than 19 out of a possible 30 on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale were randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg/day of sustained-release bupropion or placebo at 6:00 p.m. for 3 weeks. There were no significant differences between the sustained-release bupropion and placebo groups as measured by change in Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores or side effects. Future studies should compare higher doses of bupropion for treating sexual dysfunction and should include a greater number of subjects.
Summary 1: In a trial, adding bupropion or placebo showed equal improvement in sexual function.

Query 2: What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction?
Document 2: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether weekend drug holidays would improve sexual functioning in recovered depressed patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced sexual dysfunction. Thirty outpatients who reported worsening of sexual functioning during SSRI treatment were instructed to discontinue their SSRIs after the Thursday morning dose and to restart the SSRIs (at their previous dosage) on Sunday at 12:00 noon for four weekends. Significant improvement in sexual functioning was reported by the patients taking sertraline and paroxetine but not by those taking fluoxetine. There were no statistically significant increases in mean Hamilton depression scores after discontinuation of the SSRIs; two patients had increases in scores from the 4-8 range to the 10-14 range. For some patients taking sertraline and paroxetine who experience sexual dysfunction side effects, brief drug holidays may allow for significant improvement in sexual functioning without a significant return of depressive symptoms.
Summary 2: One open-label nonrandomized study of weekend ""drug holidays"" showed no benefit for fluoxetine and inconsistent results for paroxetine and sertraline.

Document: To evaluate the possible influence of buspirone on sexual dysfunction in depressed patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we analyzed data from a placebo-controlled trial designed to explore the efficacy of buspirone as add-on treatment for patients not responding to an SSRI alone. At baseline, all patients met the criteria for a major depressive episode according to DSM-IV and had received citalopram or paroxetine during a minimum of 4 weeks without responding to the treatment. Buspirone (flexible dosage, 20-60 mg/day) or placebo was added to the SSRI for 4 weeks; the mean daily dose of buspirone at endpoint was 48.5 mg (SD = 1.0). Sexual dysfunction was evaluated using a structured interview. Before starting medication with buspirone or placebo, 40% (47 of 117) reported at least one kind of sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction). During the 4 weeks of treatment, approximately 58% of subjects treated with buspirone reported an improvement with respect to sexual function; in the placebo group, the response rate was 30%. The difference between placebo and active drug treatment was more pronounced in women than in men. The response was obvious during the first week, with no further improvement during the course of the study. It is suggested that the effect of buspirone on sexual dysfunction is a result of a reversal of SSRI-induced sexual side effects rather than of an antidepressant effect of the drug.
Summary:","In on augmentation therapy, buspirone augmentation resulted in a statistical improvement in sexual functioning at weeks 2 and 3 of therapy, but not at weeks 1 and 4 (mean dose 48.5 mg per day)."

Query 1: What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome?
Document 1: Studies of antidepressants and psychological treatments in functional bowel disorders (FBD) are methodologically limited. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) against education (EDU) and desipramine (DES) against placebo (PLA) in female patients with moderate to severe FBD (irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, painful constipation, and unspecified FBD). We also evaluated the amenability of clinically meaningful subgroups to these treatments. This randomized, comparator-controlled, multicenter trial enrolled 431 adults from the University of North Carolina and the University of Toronto with moderate to severe symptoms of FBD. Participants received psychological (CBT vs. EDU) or antidepressant (DES vs. PLA) treatment for 12 weeks. Clinical, physiologic, and psychosocial assessments were performed before and at the end of treatment. The intention-to-treat analysis showed CBT as significantly more effective than EDU (P = 0.0001; responder rate, 70% CBT vs. 37% EDU; number needed to treat [NNT ], 3.1). DES did not show significant benefit over PLA in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.16; responder rate, 60% DES vs. 47% PLA; NNT, 8.1) but did show a statistically significant benefit in the per-protocol analysis (P = 0.01; responder rate, 73% DES vs. 49% PLA; NNT, 5.2), especially when participants with nondetectable blood levels of DES were excluded (P = 0.002). Improvement was best gauged by satisfaction with treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that DES was beneficial over PLA for moderate more than severe symptoms, abuse history, no depression, and diarrhea-predominant symptoms; CBT was beneficial over EDU for all subgroups except for depression. For female patients with moderate to severe FBD, CBT is effective and DES may be effective when taken adequately. Certain clinical subgroups are more or less amenable to these treatments.
Summary 1: A single-blinded study comparing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with patient education alone found cognitive-behavioral treatment more effective. The effect size was 0.50 (defined as moderate; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Analysis of response rates found that 73% responded to cognitive-behavioral treatment vs 41.3% in the education group (NNT=3.2).

Query 2: What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction?
Document 2: Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are common symptoms associated with depression. Optimal antidepressant treatment should result in remission of the symptoms of the underlying illness and minimize the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are frequently persistent or worsen with the use of some antidepressant medications; this sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction can have negative impact on adherence to treatment, quality of life, and the possibility of relapse. Successful management of sexual complaints during antidepressant treatment should begin with a systematic approach to determine the type of sexual dysfunction, potential contributing factors, and finally management strategies that should be tailored to the individual patient. The basic physiologic mechanisms of the normal sexual phases of libido, arousal, and orgasm and how these mechanisms may be interrupted by some antidepressants provide a framework for the clinician to utilize in order to minimize sexual complaints when initiating and continuing antidepressant treatment. This article provides guidelines, based upon this type of model, for the assessment, management, and prevention of sexual side effects associated with antidepressant treatment.
Summary 2: Data suggest that bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine have little to no effect on sexual functioning. Changing from SSRIs to one of these agents may alleviate SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.

Query: What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction?
Document: Few controlled trials of pharmacologic intervention in women with antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction have been reported, and there is uncertainty about the usefulness of putative treatments and the assessment methodologies. The authors evaluated the efficacy of buspirone and amantadine in the treatment of sexual dysfunction associated with fluoxetine administration. Women who had been successfully treated with fluoxetine for at least 8 weeks and who had reported a deterioration in sexual function not present before the initiation of fluoxetine entered a 4-week assessment period. After assessment they were randomly assigned to an 8-week treatment trial with buspirone (N=19), amantadine (N=18), or placebo (N=20). Outcomes were assessed by using a patient-rated daily diary and a clinician-rated structured interview. While the amantadine-treated women did report significantly greater improvements in energy levels than women in the placebo group, all treatment groups experienced improvement in overall sexual function as well as in most individual measures. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups. Neither buspirone nor amantadine was more effective than placebo in ameliorating antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction. All groups experienced marked nonspecific improvement during treatment, which suggests the importance of placebo-controlled trials for this condition.
Summary:","In a trial, adding buspirone 20 to 30 mg per day, amantadine 50 to 100 mg per day, or placebo resulted in equal improvement in women's sexual function."

Query 1: What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated?
Document 1: Dentists play a major role as part of an allied health team in providing oral care to patients with diabetes. As such, they may detect undiagnosed cases of diabetes and refer patients to physicians for further evaluation. The author describes new concepts in metabolic control for diabetes and the relationship of oral complications to diabetes mellitus. The treatment of acute oral infections and the dentist's role in supporting patients in smoking-cessation programs are approaches that may reduce morbidity from diabetes mellitus. In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist may need to modify the treatment plan where systemic complications are present. Working with the physician, nutritionist and dental hygienist, the dentist can maintain the patient's oral health and possibly improve the patient's metabolic control of diabetes. In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist can discuss the indications and contraindications of medications for the treatment of oral complications in patients with systemic complications resulting from diabetes. Using a glucometer may avert emergencies related to diabetes. The dental team can improve the metabolic control of a patient's diabetes by maintaining optimal oral health. The dentist also can reduce comorbidity factors by supporting patients in tobacco-use cessation programs. Dentists can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes by maintaining their patients' oral health and by referring patients with signs and symptoms of oral complications suggestive of diabetes to physicians for further evaluation.
Summary 1: The American Dental Association does mention topical antifungal creams for the treatment of angular cheilitis when discussing oral health and diabetes.

Query 2: Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing?
Document 2: This paper is one of a series of eight systematic reviews that aim to identify effective interventions for chronic wounds. Here, antimicrobial agents are evaluated. Electronic databases and other relevant sources were accessed to identify published and unpublished material. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used concurrent controls, recruited participants with chronic wounds, evaluated an intervention designed to prevent or treat chronic wounds, and incorporated an objective assessment of wound healing. All included studies were assessed against a comprehensive checklist for methodological quality. A narrative overview was conducted. Thirty trials were included, 25 of randomized design. Small sample size and other methodological problems meant that findings were often difficult to interpret. Results do not support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for leg ulcers or diabetic foot ulcers without acute infection, but they may be useful as an adjunct to surgery for pilonidal sinuses. Several topical preparations may be helpful, including dimethyl sulphoxide, silver sulphadiazine, benzoyl peroxide, oxyquinoline and gentamicin. Most of this research requires replication in larger, well designed studies to establish both clinical and cost effectiveness.
Summary 2: A systematic review of the treatment of chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, found 30 trials, including 25 RCTs, mostly of low quality. Little evidence supports the routine use of systemic antibiotics for patients with chronic wounds; however, some topical antiseptic and antimicrobial agents may hasten the healing of these wounds. Topical preparations that may be helpful include dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50), silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene), benzoyl peroxide (Benzac, Brevoxyl, Desquam, Triaz, ZoDerm), oxyquinoline (Trimo-san Vaginal Jelly), and gentamicin (Garamycin).

Query: What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated?
Document: This prospective study evaluated the significance of microbial analysis and antimicrobial treatment for the cure of angular cheilitis. Furthermore, various etiologic factors were investigated for their relative effect on the healing process. The study included 1) an open trial with 50 patients infected by Candida albicans and/or Staphylococcus aureus, and 2) an intraindividual comparison of eight patients with bilateral lesions infected by Candida albicans as the only detected pathogen. After a base-line examination the patients received ointments containing nystatin and/or fusidic acid, on the basis of the outcome of an initial microbial analysis. The patients were evaluated clinically, photographed, and examined for microorganisms at different time intervals. Ninety-six per cent of the patients who participated in the open trial had no sign of infection after 42 days of treatment. Lesions in the double-blind study, treated with nystatin, were healed after 28 days, whereas lesions that received placebo persisted throughout the treatment period. Increasing age, dry skin, and extended skinfolds at the corner of the mouth were factors closely related to the length of the healing process.
Summary:","A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 8 patients compared the efficacy of nystatin with placebo ointment. These patients were referred to a Department of Oral Diagnosis for sore lips with detected Candida albicans lesions located bilaterally. All of the patients were instructed to use one ointment on the right side and the other on the left side. Contamination was prevented by the use of gloves changed between applications. All 8 patients demonstrated complete healing after 1 to 4 weeks of treatment by nystatin, whereas only 1 patient had complete healing after the placebo, giving a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.14 (P<.001)."

Query 1: Is DEET safe for children?
Document 1: Reducing the risk of mosquito bites is currently the only way to reduce the risk of West Nile virus infection. Methods for avoiding mosquito bites include limiting the time spent outdoors at dawn and dusk, wearing protective clothing and using an insect repellent. Repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, also known as N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are the most effective and most widely used. However, concerns have been raised over the risk of adverse toxic effects, especially in young children and pregnant and lactating women. In this article, we review the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of DEET-based products. The evidence does not support increased risk in young children.
Summary 1: A review found that DEET posed essentially no risk in children.

Query 2: Is DEET safe for children?
Document 2: This study analyzed 9,086 human exposures involving N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide--containing insect repellents that were reported to Poison Control Centers from 1985-1989. Nearly two-thirds of those exposed had no adverse effects or only experienced minor symptoms that resolved rapidly. Symptoms were more likely to occur after ocular or inhalation exposures and least likely to occur if the product was ingested. The only reported death occurred in a patient who suicidally ingested 8 oz of an insect repellent containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. Five patients may have experienced a serious or potentially life-threatening effect but the poison center record did not provide unequivocal substantiation of the effect or clearly establish N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide as the causative agent. From the analysis of those patients calling Poison Control Centers, it appears the risk of serious medical effects with the labeled use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide-containing insect repellents is low in comparison with its reported annual use by about 30% of Americans. For patients contacting Poison Control Centers, the occurrence of adverse effects appears to be related to the route of exposure rather than age or gender of the patient or the concentration of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in the product.
Summary 2: A case series collected poison control center reports during the 1980s. The report concluded that DEET exposure rarely led to adverse effects and that the route of administration (ie, ingestion) was more closely linked to toxicity than age or gender. There were 5 major adverse reactions reported from 9086 exposures to DEET (0.05%); these included hypotension, hypotonic reaction, and syncope, and 1 death (a suicide ingestion).

Query: Is DEET safe for children?
Document: N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide, an effective tick repellent, when applied to the skin, is the major component of essentially all of the products marketed for this purpose. It is used by about 30% of the US population, and by 23-29% of children in this population. Reports of neurologic adversity and death are rare and primarily involve children, but the dose relationship between N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide exposure and the symptoms reported in the clinical literature is difficult to establish. Animal toxicology studies, clinical reports of neurological adversities in children and adults, and the available Poison Control Center records have been reviewed in an effort to understand the relationship between the N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide exposure and reported adverse events. Based on (1) the animal toxicology database on N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, (2) the reports of adverse events in humans, and (3) the possible alternate etiologies for the symptoms reported in most patients, the risk of adversity from label-directed use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide appears low. Future efforts should focus on the prospective collection of adversity data with special attention paid to the documentation of clinical effects.
Summary:","A review was sponsored by SC Johnson and Company, the makers of OFF! brand insect repellent. It assessed animal studies, epidemiologic data, and case reports, and supported the safety of DEET in children."

Query 2: Is DEET safe for children?
Document 2: The worldwide threat of arthropod-transmitted diseases, with their associated morbidity and mortality, underscores the need for effective insect repellents. Multiple chemical, botanical, and ""alternative"" repellent products are marketed to consumers. We sought to determine which products available in the United States provide reliable and prolonged complete protection from mosquito bites. We conducted studies involving 15 volunteers to test the relative efficacy of seven botanical insect repellents; four products containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, now called N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET); a repellent containing IR3535 (ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate); three repellent-impregnated wristbands; and a moisturizer that is commonly claimed to have repellent effects. These products were tested in a controlled laboratory environment in which the species of the mosquitoes, their age, their degree of hunger, the humidity, the temperature, and the light-dark cycle were all kept constant. DEET-based products provided complete protection for the longest duration. Higher concentrations of DEET provided longer-lasting protection. A formulation containing 23.8 percent DEET had a mean complete-protection time of 301.5 minutes. A soybean-oil-based repellent protected against mosquito bites for an average of 94.6 minutes. The IR3535-based repellent protected for an average of 22.9 minutes. All other botanical repellents we tested provided protection for a mean duration of less than 20 minutes. Repellent-impregnated wristbands offered no protection. Currently available non-DEET repellents do not provide protection for durations similar to those of DEET-based repellents and cannot be relied on to provide prolonged protection in environments where mosquito-borne diseases are a substantial threat.
Summary 2: Increasing the concentration of DEET does not improve protection but does provide longer duration. Concentrations of 6.65% protect for about 2 hours while 23.8% DEET can last about 5 hours.

Query: Is DEET safe for children?
Document: Toxicology studies are typically performed on single compounds, which we hypothesized would miss adverse synergies from chemical mixtures. This hypothesis was tested using an insect repellant and sunscreens because both groups include known permeation enhancers, with prior pediatric reports of toxicity from highly concentrated DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Using real-time mass spectroscopy in a hairless mouse skin model, we confirmed substantial penetration of a 20% DEET standard. Despite a lower (10%) DEET content, a commercially marketed sunscreen formulation had a 6-fold more rapid detection (5 versus 30 min) and 3.4-fold greater penetration at steady state. We also tested the efficacy of DEET microemulsion products and confirmed that one successfully slowed the onset of absorption, but not the steady-state permeation. Risks from mixtures of potential toxins are worthy of routine testing, which can be accomplished by simple assays, and are of utmost importance for pediatric applications.
Summary:","Some studies have uncovered dangerous interactions with military and industrial chemicals, but such exposures are unlikely in most children. The most practical concern regards sun-screen. One study reported that use of sun-screen increased the penetration of DEET."

Query 1: Do endovascular filters prevent pulmonary embolism  as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis?
Document 1: Pulmonary emboli can have potentially fatal consequences. Inferior vena caval filters are metal alloy devices that mechanically trap fragmented thromboemboli from the deep leg veins en route to the pulmonary circulation. Filters in current clinical use are designed to be introduced (and in the case of retrievable filters, removed) percutaneously. Although their deployment seems of theoretical benefit, their clinical efficacy and adverse event profile is unclear. To examine evidence for the effectiveness of vena caval filters in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary outcomes were mortality, distal (to filter) thrombosis, and filter-related complications. We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register (last searched August 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3, MEDLINE (1966 to August 2007), and EMBASE (1966 to August 2007). Filter manufacturers and clinicians interested in filters were contacted for information. Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy of filters in preventing PE were selected. Three authors extracted information independently. Incidence figures were extracted from survival tables. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed as hazard ratio estimates. One RCT was included. The PREPIC (Prévention du Risque d'Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave) trial was an open RCT of 400 participants with documented proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE and who received concurrent anticoagulation. Permanent caval filters prevented PE at eight years (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.79, in favour of the filter). No reduction in mortality was seen, but this reflected an older study population (mean age 73 years); the majority of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular causes. There was an increased incidence of DVT in the filter group (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.27). No details were recorded of adverse events of filters. Limited generalisability prevents any conclusions to be drawn from the PREPIC trial in that permanent filters were used and the study lacked statistical power to detect a reduction in PE over shorter and more clinically significant time periods. However, the PREPIC trial demonstrated that permanent caval filters were associated with an increased risk of long term lower limb DVT. There is a marked paucity of caval filter outcomes evidence when used within their currently approved indications. There is also a lack of retrievable filter trials. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter safety and effectiveness.
Summary 1: The study lacked statistical power to draw any conclusion about the efficacy of IVCFs in preventing pulmonary embolism  over shorter time periods or in reducing PE-related or overall mortality.

Query 2: Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity?
Document 2: To investigate the effect of compression and immediate ambulation in the acute stage of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the development of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Design: follow-up study of patients who previously have been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Setting: outpatient department of a municipial hospital. Subjects and interventions: a follow-up was performed 2 years after 53 patients with acute proximal DVT had been enrolled into a randomized controlled trial, comparing bed rest and no compression (n=17), Unna boot bandages plus walking (n=18) and compression stockings plus walking (n=18). Telephone interviews could be conducted with 11 patients, 37 patients could be reinvestigated by independent observers (11 from the bed-rest group, 13 from the bandage group and 13 from the stocking group). Compression stockings up to the time of the follow-up were worn by 8/11 (73%) of the bed-rest patients and by 13/26 (50%) of the mobile patients. Main outcome measures: clinical and venous duplex investigation, pain assessment using visual analogue scale and Lowenberg test, leg circumference, clinical ''PTS-score'' combining 5 subjective symptoms with 6 objective signs (Villalta-Prandoni-scale). Duplex investigation of the deep veins and pain assessment by visual analogue scale showed no significant differences between the groups. Nine out of 11 patients after bed rest, but only 16/26 in the mobile groups showed a larger calf circumference on the diseased leg (n.s.). Judged by the Villalta-Prandoni-scale a significantly better outcome could be found in the mobile group (mean score 5.1) than in the bed-rest group (mean score 8.2), (p<0.01). (''Mild PTS'' = score 5-14, ''severe PTS'' score = or > 15). Eighteen out of 26 mobile patients, but only 2/11 bed-rest patients had a score = or < 5 (''no PTS''). Immediate mobilisation with compression in the acute stage of DVT reduces the incidence and the severity of PTS.
Summary 2: The difference between ambulation with leg compression, compared with bed rest without compression, was detectable 2 years after DVT.

Query: Do endovascular filters prevent PE as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with DVT?
Document: The bird's nest inferior vena cava filter, in clinical trial since 1982, has been placed in 568 patients at risk for pulmonary embolism. Of the 481 patients in whom the filter had been in place for 6 months or more, 440 were followed up clinically. The prevalence of clinically suspected recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism was 2.7% (12 patients) and that of inferior vena cava filter occlusion was 2.9% (13 patients). With the initial filter design, filter migration occurred in five patients. No migrations have occurred in the 147 patients treated with the filter after its modification to improve the anchoring system for greater stability. The bird's nest filter has proved safe and effective in the prevention of pulmonary embolism.
Summary:","A prospective cohort study followed 481 patients who received an IVCF because of either a contraindication to anticoagulation or sustained recurrent embolization despite adequate anticoagulation. Of the patients who had a filter for 6 months or longer, 2% had clinically suspected PE, but PE was confirmed in only 0.5%."

Query 1: Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain?
Document 1: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disorder worldwide and is associated with significant pain and disability. To assess the effects of viscosupplementation in the treatment of OA of the knee. The products were hyaluronan and hylan derivatives (Adant, Arthrum H, Artz (Artzal, Supartz), BioHy (Arthrease, Euflexxa, Nuflexxa), Durolane, Fermathron, Go-On, Hyalgan, Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Hylan G-F 20), Hyruan, NRD-101 (Suvenyl), Orthovisc, Ostenil, Replasyn, SLM-10, Suplasyn, Synject and Zeel compositum). MEDLINE (up to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents up to July 2003, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Specialised journals and reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pertinent review articles up to December 2005 were handsearched. RCTs of viscosupplementation for the treatment of people with a diagnosis of OA of the knee were eligible. Single and double-blinded studies, placebo-based and comparative studies were eligible. At least one of the four OMERACT III core set outcome measures had to be reported (Bellamy 1997). Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers for its methodological quality using a validated tool. All data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer . Continuous outcome measures were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, where different scales were used to measure the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by relative risk (RR). Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention. In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids. In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products. The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA class and particularly positive for some products with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection. In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events. In other analyses HA products had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids. Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.
Summary 1: The comprehensive 2006 Cochrane meta-analysis reviewed single- and double-blinded RCTs that evaluated the effect of 12 HA products on osteoarthritis of the knee.3 Studies compared HA products with placebo (40), intra-articular steroids (10), NSAIDs (6), physical therapy (3), exercise (2), and each other (15). Efficacy data for different products could not be combined because the studies measured different sets of outcomes at different time points. Overall, the authors concluded that HA injections effectively reduced pain scores, with the largest benefit occurring within 5 to 13 weeks. The authors also noted that the reductions in pain with HA injections, although generally small, were comparable to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs therapy and intra-articular corticosteroids. The trials reported few adverse events.

Query 2: Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain?
Document 2: To compare the efficacy and safety of intraarticular hylan and 2 hyaluronic acids (HAs) in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. This was a multicenter, patient-blind, randomized controlled trial in 660 patients with symptomatic knee OA. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 cycle of 3 intraarticular injections per knee of 1 of 3 preparations: a high molecular weight cross-linked hylan, a non-cross-linked medium molecular weight HA of avian origin, or a non-cross-linked low molecular weight HA of bacterial origin. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included local adverse events (effusions or flares) in injected knees. During months 7-12, patients were offered a second cycle of viscosupplementation. Pain relief was similar in all 3 groups. The difference in changes between baseline and 6 months between hylan and the combined HAs was 0.1 on the WOMAC pain score (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.2, 0.3). No relevant differences were observed in any of the secondary efficacy outcomes, and stratified analyses provided no evidence for differences in effects across different patient groups. There was a trend toward more local adverse events in the hylan group than in the HA groups during the first cycle (difference 2.2% [95% CI -2.4, 6.7]), and this trend became more pronounced during the second cycle (difference 6.4% [95% CI 0.6, 12.2]). We found no evidence for a difference in efficacy between hylan and HAs. In view of its higher costs and potential for more local adverse events, we see no rationale for the continued use of hylan in patients with knee OA.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review determined that not enough evidence existed to evaluate HA products against each other. An RCTs compared HA products and found no differences in efficacy. The study compared Synvisc, Orthovisc, and Ostenil therapy in 660 patients over 6 months.

Query: Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain?
Document: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disorder worldwide and is associated with significant pain and disability. To assess the effects of viscosupplementation in the treatment of OA of the knee. The products were hyaluronan and hylan derivatives (Adant, Arthrum H, Artz (Artzal, Supartz), BioHy (Arthrease, Euflexxa, Nuflexxa), Durolane, Fermathron, Go-On, Hyalgan, Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Hylan G-F 20), Hyruan, NRD-101 (Suvenyl), Orthovisc, Ostenil, Replasyn, SLM-10, Suplasyn, Synject and Zeel compositum). MEDLINE (up to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents up to July 2003, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Specialised journals and reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pertinent review articles up to December 2005 were handsearched. RCTs of viscosupplementation for the treatment of people with a diagnosis of OA of the knee were eligible. Single and double-blinded studies, placebo-based and comparative studies were eligible. At least one of the four OMERACT III core set outcome measures had to be reported (Bellamy 1997). Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers for its methodological quality using a validated tool. All data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer . Continuous outcome measures were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, where different scales were used to measure the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by relative risk (RR). Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention. In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids. In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products. The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA class and particularly positive for some products with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection. In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events. In other analyses HA products had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids. Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.

Query 1: Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain?
Document 1: To compare the safety and effectiveness of a high molecular weight hyaluronan produced by biological fermentation (Bio-HA) with those of avian-derived hyaluronan that uses cross-linking to achieve high molecular weight (CL-HA). This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating patients with confirmed osteoarthritis of the knee. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC Index) pain subscale was the primary effectiveness measure (visual analog scale). Both products were administered via three weekly injections, with follow-up evaluations at weeks 3, 6 and 12. Acetaminophen was permitted as rescue medication and quantitated by pill counts. Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population, defined as all patients receiving at least one injection. Of the 321 patients randomized to treatment, 314 patients (98%) completed the final study assessment. Improvement in the average WOMAC Index pain score was 29.8mm (-61.6%) for Bio-HA and 28.8mm (-54.9%) for CL-HA, meeting the prospective criteria for non-inferiority. For the secondary outcome measures, statistically significant differences favored Bio-HA for the number of patients requiring acetaminophen (P=0.013) and patient global satisfaction evaluations (P=0.03). Local reactions differed between the products in that 15 effusions were reported in 13 CL-HA patients (8.1%) after injection, compared to one effusion (0.6%) after Bio-HA injection (P=0.0015). The effectiveness of Bio-HA was not inferior to that of CL-HA. The significantly higher incidence of post-injection effusion in the CL-HA group provides a safety advantage for Bio-HA. These data suggest that Bio-HA has an improved benefit-risk profile compared with CL-HA.
Summary 1: A Cochrane review determined that not enough evidence existed to evaluate HA products against each other. An RCTs compared HA products and found no differences in efficacy. The study compared Synvisc with Euflexxa in 321 patients over 3 months. Notably, 8% of patients in this study who used Synvisc developed an effusion, compared with 0.6% of patients who used Euflexxa (P=.0015).

Query 2: Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee?
Document 2: To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat. Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors. Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained. In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16-24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients. Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16-24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16-24 weeks.
Summary 2: Two studies using higher-dose steroids (prednisone equivalent dose of 37.5 to 80 mg), with or without joint lavage, assessed improvement at 16 to 24 weeks. Although neither individual study showed statistically significant differences, the pooled data from the 2 studies favored symptom improvement at 16 to 24 weeks (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7; NNT=4.4).

Query: Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain?
Document: Osteoarthritis of the knee affects up to 10% of the elderly population. The condition is frequently treated by intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of this treatment. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register from inception until April 2004 using a combination of search terms for knee osteoarthritis and hyaluronic acid and a filter for randomized controlled trials. We extracted data on pain at rest, pain during or immediately after movement, joint function and adverse events. Twenty-two trials that reported usable quantitative information on any of the predefined end points were identified and included in the systematic review. Even though pain at rest may be improved by hyaluronic acid, the data available from these studies did not allow an appropriate assessment of this end point. Patients who received the intervention experienced a reduction in pain during movement: the mean difference on a 100-mm visual analogue scale was -3.8 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] -9.1 to 1.4 mm) after 2-6 weeks, -4.3 mm (95% CI -7.6 to -0.9 mm) after 10-14 weeks and -7.1 mm (95% CI -11.8 to -2.4 mm) after 22-30 weeks. However, this effect was not compatible with a clinically meaningful difference (expected to be about 15 mm on the visual analogue scale). Furthermore, the effect was exaggerated by trials not reporting an intention-to-treat analysis. No improvement in knee function was observed at any time point. Even so, the effect of hyaluronic acid on knee function was more favourable when allocation was not concealed. Adverse events occurred slightly more often among patients who received the intervention (relative risk 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15). Only 4 trials explicitly reported allocation concealment, had blinded outcome assessment and presented intention-to-treat data. According to the currently available evidence, intra-articular hyaluronic acid has not been proven clinically effective and may be associated with a greater risk of adverse events. Large trials with clinically relevant and uniform end points are necessary to clarify the benefit-risk ratio.
Summary:","A 2005 meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of HA injections for osteoarthritis of the knee compared with saline placebo. Researchers identified 22 studies of 8 HA products that used the common end point of pain with movement. A decrease in pain of 15% was deemed clinically meaningful. Compared with placebo, the mean difference in pain scores with HA products was -4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -9% to 1%) after 2 to 6 weeks; -4% (95% CI, -8% to -1%) after 10 to 14 weeks; and -7% (95% CI, -12% to -2%) after 22 to 30 weeks. The authors note that the small measured effect of HA was magnified by trials that didn't report intention-to-treat results. The effect of HA was also larger in studies that didn't conceal allocation. A weakness of the analysis was its inability to assess potential differences between HA products. In this 2005 meta-analysis, HA injection didn't improve knee function in any time interval."

Query 1: Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema?
Document 1: The incidence of refractory atopic dermatitis has increased in teenagers and young adults. The purpose of this study was to control the skin symptoms of such patients in daily life. Seventy patients repeatedly took a 10-min 42 degrees C acidic hot-spring bath twice daily. The skin symptoms were improved in 76% of cases. In 30 of 42 responders examined Staphylococcus aureus, detected on the skin surface, disappeared or decreased through balneotherapy. In contrast, S. aureus remained unchanged in 8 of 10 non-responders examined. Thus, the balneotherapy using acidic hot-spring water may be useful for controlling the skin symptoms of acute flares of refractory cases of atopic dermatitis.
Summary 1: In a case control study of 70 patients (ages 12-80 years, mean 23 years,) bathing in acidic hot spring water (42º C) helped control edema, erythema, exudation, and excoriation in refractory cases of eczema.

Document 2: In a double-blind, randomized, paired trial lasting 14 days in 72 patients with moderately severe atopic eczema, hamamelis distillate cream (5.35 g hamamelis distillate with 0.64 mg ketone/100 g) was compared with the corresponding drug-free vehicle and 0.5% hydrocortisone cream, and reductions of the basic criteria of severe atopic eczema (delta values of the sum scores), i.e. itching, erythema and scaling, were evaluated. Thirty-six patients in each group were treated, which allowed the detection of a 10% difference between verum and control (confirmatory study). Effects were compared using Wilcoxon's test. The mean sum scores of the basic criteria of the test areas were 5.3-5.5. All treatment regimens significantly reduced itching, erythema and scaling after 1 week. Hydrocortisone proved superior to hamamelis distillate. The basic criteria scores decreased by 2.7 and 1.6, respectively. The delta values of the minor criteria and the global rating of efficacy were also used to indicate the difference between these preparations. Hamamelis distillate cream, however, did not differ from the vehicle. Mean delta values of basic criteria were 1.8 and 2.0, respectively. All preparations were well tolerated. Unwanted cutaneous reactions occurred in six patients, although due to their inflammatory nature and their confinement to vehicle-treated patients, they may not represent true adverse effects but rather a lack of efficacy. The results prove the superiority of low-dose hydrocortisone cream over hamamelis distillate cream, and the therapeutic outcome following this preparation was no better than following the base preparation. The mild, yet unmistakable anti-inflammatory effect of hamamelis cream in experimental models of inflammatory skin disease was thus not reflected by an efficacy in patients with atopic eczema greater than that obtained from the base preparation.
Summary 2: Hamamelis (witch hazel) distillate cream was inferior to steroid creams.

Query: Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema?
Document: Thirty patients with mild to moderate bilateral atopic eczema were treated on one side of the body with a new purified coal tar cream (Clinitar) and on the other side with 1% hydrocortisone cream, for 4 weeks. The degree of infiltration of the skin erythema, lichenification, excoriations and dryness were assessed. Both treatments were equally effective in reducing symptoms and there was also no difference in patient preference and cosmetic acceptability.
Summary:",Only 1 study has evaluated the use of tar: a comparison of 30 patients (mean age 11.8 years) who were treated with tar on one side of the body and 1% hydrocortisone on the other. Both treatments produced comparable results and were well tolerated. But compliance can be a problem with tar products because they smell unpleasant and stain clothing.

Query 2: What is the role of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis?
Document 2: To compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adult and pediatric patients with mild to very severe atopic dermatitis (AD). One thousand and sixty-five patients were randomized to treatment in 3 multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week studies. Based on the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study in adults (54.1% vs. 34.9%, respectively; P < .0001), in children with moderate/severe disease (67.2% vs. 56.4%, respectively; P = .04), in the combined analysis (52.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively; P < .0001), and at week 1 in children with mild disease (39.2% vs. 31.2%, respectively; P = .04). Tacrolimus was also more effective than pimecrolimus based on the Investigator Global AD Assessment (IGADA), improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected, and improvement in itch scores (P < or = .05), with a faster onset of action. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including application site reactions in the 2 studies involving 650 children. Adults treated with tacrolimus experienced a greater number of local application site reactions on day 1; both groups reported a similar incidence of application site reactions thereafter. More pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P < or = .03) or adverse events (P = .002; pediatric mild). Tacrolimus ointment is more effective and has a faster onset of action than pimecrolimus cream in adults and children with AD; their safety profiles are similar.
Summary 2: In a meta-analysis of 3 randomized studies of head-to-head comparison of pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% among children and adults, tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study for adults (P<.0001), for children with moderate-to-severe disease (P=.04), in the combined analysis (P<.0001), and at week 1 for children with mild disease (P=.04). No significant difference was seen in the incidence of adverse effects, although more pimecrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P≤.03) or adverse events (P=.002; pediatric mild).

Document: To examine the efficacy and safety of MAS063DP (Atopiclair) cream in the management of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in infants and children. One hundred forty-two patients aged 6 months to 12 years were administered MAS063DP (n = 72) or vehicle (n = 70) cream 3 times per day to affected areas and sites prone to develop atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the Investigator's Global Assessment at day 22. Secondary endpoints included Investigator's Global Assessment at other time-points, patient's/caregiver's assessment of pruritus, onset, duration of itch relief, Eczema Area and Severity Index, subject's/caregiver's assessment of global response, and need for rescue medication in the event of an atopic dermatitis flare. MAS063DP cream was statistically more effective (P < .0001) than vehicle cream for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. Treatment discontinuation as a result of an adverse event occurred in 9.9% of patients using MAS063DP cream and 16% of patients using vehicle cream. MAS063DP cream is effective and safe as monotherapy for the treatment of symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in infants and children.
Summary:","MAS063DP is a nonsteroidal, hydrolipidic cream containing glycyrrhetinic acid (GrA), vitis vinifera (grapevine extract), and telmestine. A recent multicenter RCT of 142 children compared MAS063DP to vehicle cream alone. The primary outcome was treatment success defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment score of ≤1 (range 0-5), measured on day 22. Therapy was successful in 77% of the treatment group vs 0% of the vehicle-only group (number needed to treat=1)."

Query 1: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document 1: There are obvious gaps in research surrounding issues specific to women who suffer from bipolar disorder, including gender differences and their implications for management, the impact of the reproductive cycle, and evidence based treatment guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period. Gender differences have not been reported for the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, mixed mania, and antidepressant-induced manias. This may affect response to treatment, which has been found, in some cases, to differ in men and women. In addition, side effects in response to treatments may well differ in men and women, especially with regard to lithium and valproate prescription. The course of bipolar disorder in women may be influenced by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause, although many issues require further clarification. Treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postmenopausal period requires careful consideration, as does treatment during the childbearing years, as some mood stabilizers influence the metabolism of oral contraceptives. This review article has attempted to evaluate existing literature regarding women with bipolar disorder in a comprehensive and critical way, and to consolidate into a single source the gender-specific aspects of the disorder that may have treatment implications for women.
Summary 1: Monitor the levels of lithium and anticonvulsants monthly through the second trimester, then weekly during the third trimester because of blood volume changes.

Query 1: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document 1: The chronic, complex, and episodic course of bipolar mood disorder presents a particularly formidable challenge to the clinician making a treatment plan for the onset or recurrence of the illness during pregnancy and lactation. Women treated with anti-manic drugs who become pregnant are commonly considered to be at high risk for fetal complications during the pregnancy or during lactation. The risks of antimanic drug use during pregnancy include teratogenic effects, direct neonatal toxicity, and the potential for longer-term neurobehavioral sequela. The use of medications during pregnancy and lactation requires critical attention to the timing of exposure, dosage, duration of use, and fetal susceptibility. The postnatal period is a time of increased onset and relapse of mental illness. No antimanic drug can be proven completely safe. Prescribing antimanic medications with a long safety record, avoiding exposure in the first trimester; avoiding multidrug regimens, and prescribing the lowest dose for the shortest duration will minimize the fetal risk. This review considers treatment with lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. It assesses the risk to the fetus, the perinatal risks for the infant, the risks associated with treatment during the puerperium and breast-feeding, and the risks to the later development of the child.
Summary 1: The most common complication, occurring in 1.5% of cases, were fetal arrhythmias. Avoiding atropine, maintaining oxygenation, avoiding excessive hyperventilation, and elevating the right hip can decrease the risk of fetal arrhythmias during electroconvulsive therapy.

Query 2: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document 2: Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years and the need may arise to start or continue a pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In the last few years several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone. A number of studies, which examined the use of oxcarbazepine, point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A computerized search carried out from 1980 to April 5, 2006 led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.) Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal. Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms. On the other hand, classic antiepileptic drugs are well-known human teratogens, whereas data on lithium are partially ambiguous. The safety of emerging mood stabilizers in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been examined extensively. Therefore, when approaching bipolar disorder, if possible, each episode must be considered separately.
Summary 2: Antiseizure medications, including carbamazepine and valproic acid, are considered human teratogens in the first trimester. If a woman has an unplanned pregnancy and presents late in the first trimester or in the second trimester, discontinuation of these medication in stable patients is not recommended. Valproate and carbamazepine are both compatible with breastfeeding.

Query: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document: Mood disorders in pregnancy may have a negative effect on self care and pregnancy outcome that affects the mother directly and the child indirectly. Thus, some women may require pharmacological treatment. Pharmacotherapy of mood disorders during pregnancy implies specific considerations. This paper presents an updated review of available studies on the treatment of mood disorders and present knowledge on teratogenicity, neonatal effects and long-term neurobehavioural effects for the different psychotropic drugs, including treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, carbamazepine/valproic acid, lamotrigine and novel antipsychotics. However, the existing knowledge on the use of antidepressants and mood stabilising agents during pregnancy is hampered by a lack of results from randomised controlled trials.SSRIs and TCAs have not been associated with an increased risk of major malformations, but poor neonatal adaptation has been described. Benzodiazepines used in the first trimester have been associated with orofacial clefts. Mood stabilisers such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations. Both benzodiazepines and lithium may cause adaptation problems in the newborn. In utero exposure to novel antipsychotics has not been associated with congenital malformations; however, the data are still limited. The knowledge about long-term neurobehavioural effects in the offspring is still limited for all agents and requires further investigation. Possible adverse effects of fetal exposure must be balanced against the adverse effects of an untreated maternal mood disorder.
Summary:","Atypical antipsychotics have not been well studied, but there is no conclusive evidence that they cause fetal malformations."

The postnatal period is a time of increased onset and relapse of mental illness. No antimanic drug can be proven completely safe. Prescribing antimanic medications with a long safety record, avoiding exposure in the first trimester; avoiding multidrug regimens, and prescribing the lowest dose for the shortest duration will minimize the fetal risk. This review considers treatment with lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. It assesses the risk to the fetus, the perinatal risks for the infant, the risks associated with treatment during the puerperium and breast-feeding, and the risks to the later development of the child.
Summary 1: The most common complication, occurring in 1.5% of cases, were fetal arrhythmias. Avoiding atropine, maintaining oxygenation, avoiding excessive hyperventilation, and elevating the right hip can decrease the risk of fetal arrhythmias during electroconvulsive therapy.

Query 2: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document 2: Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years and the need may arise to start or continue a pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In the last few years several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone. A number of studies, which examined the use of oxcarbazepine, point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A computerized search carried out from 1980 to April 5, 2006 led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.) Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal. Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms. On the other hand, classic antiepileptic drugs are well-known human teratogens, whereas data on lithium are partially ambiguous. The safety of emerging mood stabilizers in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been examined extensively. Therefore, when approaching bipolar disorder, if possible, each episode must be considered separately.
Summary 2: Antiseizure medications, including carbamazepine and valproic acid, are considered human teratogens in the first trimester. If a woman has an unplanned pregnancy and presents late in the first trimester or in the second trimester, discontinuation of these medication in stable patients is not recommended. Valproate and carbamazepine are both compatible with breastfeeding.

Query: What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy?
Document: Mood disorders in pregnancy may have a negative effect on self care and pregnancy outcome that affects the mother directly and the child indirectly. Thus, some women may require pharmacological treatment. Pharmacotherapy of mood disorders during pregnancy implies specific considerations. This paper presents an updated review of available studies on the treatment of mood disorders and present knowledge on teratogenicity, neonatal effects and long-term neurobehavioural effects for the different psychotropic drugs, including treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, carbamazepine/valproic acid, lamotrigine and novel antipsychotics. However, the existing knowledge on the use of antidepressants and mood stabilising agents during pregnancy is hampered by a lack of results from randomised controlled trials.SSRIs and TCAs have not been associated with an increased risk of major malformations, but poor neonatal adaptation has been described. Benzodiazepines used in the first trimester have been associated with orofacial clefts. Mood stabilisers such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations. Both benzodiazepines and lithium may cause adaptation problems in the newborn. In utero exposure to novel antipsychotics has not been associated with congenital malformations; however, the data are still limited. The knowledge about long-term neurobehavioural effects in the offspring is still limited for all agents and requires further investigation. Possible adverse effects of fetal exposure must be balanced against the adverse effects of an untreated maternal mood disorder.
Summary:",Data on the treatment of bipolar disease among fertile women are limited to case-control studies and drug registries because of a lack of RCTs in this population.

Query 1: What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy?
Document 1: In a retrospective study to compare the drug consumption during pregnancy of mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities and of those without, over 97% of 1,369 mothers took prescribed drugs and 65% self-administered drugs. Significantly more mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities took aspirin, antacids, dextroamphetamine, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal, other barbiturates, cough medicines, iron, sulphonamides, and nicotinamide than mothers in the control group. However, most mothers taking analgesics, antacids, appetite suppressants, barbiturates, cough medicines, iron, sulphonamides, and vitamins produced normal infants. Any teratogenic effect of these drugs is therefore one of low potency. On the other hand, deficiencies such as those of ascorbic acid and folic acid may have a teratogenic effect. There is need for caution in presuming teratogenic effects on the basis of the associations shown here. During pregnancy, however, it would appear wise to avoid the administration of any drug which carries a suspicion of teratogenicity unless that drug is specifically indicated, and self-medication with common household remedies such as aspirin and antacids should be avoided. These recommendations would also apply to any woman of childbearing age in whom conception is likely.
Summary 1: A single case-control study found a higher rate of congenital anomalies in children of women who took antacids in the first trimester (unadjusted odds ratio calculated from data=2.36; P <.05). This association was not detected when studied over the entire pregnancy. The rate of malformations was not different for magnesium, aluminum, and bicarbonate. The association could well be due to recall bias or other systematic biases inherent in case-control methodology.

Query 2: Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy?
Document 2: We investigated if selected maternal illnesses or medications used during the periconceptional period increased risk of having neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancies. We used a population-based case-control study of fetuses and liveborn infants with NTDs among 1989-1991 California births. In-person interviews were conducted with mothers of 538 (88% of eligible) NTD cases and 539 (88%) nonmalformed controls, usually within 5 months of delivery. A maternal fever or febrile illness episode in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk for having a NTD-affected pregnancy, odds ratio (OR) = 1.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.72) for fever and OR = 2.02 (1.20-3.43) for febrile illness. Risk estimates were not substantially altered after adjustment for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, vitamin use, and body mass index. Other reported illnesses were generally not associated with risks of 1.5 or greater, or were too infrequent to adequately estimate risk. An OR of 1.5 or greater was observed for maternal use of guaifenesin, OR = 2.04 (0.79-5.28), and an OR of 0.5 or less was observed for maternal use of calcium-containing medicines, OR = 0.38 (0.14-1.03). Our findings are consistent with previous reports that suggested elevated NTD risks from maternal fever. We could not discriminate, however, whether the increased risks observed for maternal fever were indicative of a causal relation or due to reporting bias. Our findings suggest that many of the illnesses common to reproductive-aged women and the medications commonly used to treat them during pregnancy, except, perhaps, for those illnesses that are febrile-related, do not appear to substantially contribute to the occurrence of NTDs in the population.
Summary 2: Guaifenesin use in pregnancy may also be associated with neural tube defects. In a case-control study, researchers identified 538 fetuses and live-born infants with neural tube defects between 1989 and 1991. Twelve patients with neural tube defects were exposed to guaifenesin during gestation; 6 in the control group reported exposure. The authors reported a trend towards increased risk of neural tube defects in offspring of guaifenesin-exposed mothers (odds ratio=2.04; 95% CI, 0.79-5.28). However, since the results were not statistically significant, the authors concluded that guaifenesin had not contributed to the occurrence of neural tube defects.

Query: Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy?
Document: The authors determined the prevalence of certain major congenital disorders among live-born infants of 6509 mothers in a prepaid health plan for the 30-month period of January 1, 1980 through June 30, 1982 who used a wide variety of drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The results were similar to those obtained in this population in a prior 30-month study. No strong associations between any of the commonly used drugs and the congenital disorders studied were present.
Summary:","In a study evaluating 6509 women whose pregnancies resulted in live births, 241 women reported first-trimester exposure to guaifenesin. Five of the guaifenesin-exposed infants (2.1%) had 1 of the birth defects studied (types of disorders not reported). The calculated RR of birth defect after in utero guaifenesin exposure was 1.3 (no CIs or P values reported); the authors concluded that there was no strong association between guaifenesin and the malformations studied."

Query 1: Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document 1: To assess and compare the effects of candesartan or lisinopril, or both, on blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in patients with microalbuminuria, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Prospective, randomised, parallel group, double blind study with four week placebo run in period and 12 weeks' monotherapy with candesartan or lisinopril followed by 12 weeks' monotherapy or combination treatment. Tertiary hospitals and primary care centres in four countries (37 centres). 199 patients aged 30-75 years. Candesartan 16 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily. Blood pressure and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio. At 12 weeks mean (95% confidence interval) reductions in diastolic blood pressure were 9.5 mm Hg (7.7 mm Hg to 11.2 mm Hg, P<0.001) and 9.7 mm Hg (7.9 mm Hg to 11.5 mm Hg, P<0.001), respectively, and in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were 30% (15% to 42%, P<0.001) and 46% (35% to 56%, P<0.001) for candesartan and lisinopril, respectively. At 24 weeks the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure with combination treatment (16.3 mm Hg, 13.6 mm Hg to 18.9 mm Hg, P<0. 001) was significantly greater than that with candesartan (10.4 mm Hg, 7.7 mm Hg to 13.1 mm Hg, P<0.001) or lisinopril (mean 10.7 mm Hg, 8.0 mm Hg to 13.5 mm Hg, P<0.001). Furthermore, the reduction in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio with combination treatment (50%, 36% to 61%, P<0.001) was greater than with candesartan (24%, 0% to 43%, P=0.05) and lisinopril (39%, 20% to 54%, P<0.001). All treatments were generally well tolerated. Candesartan 16 mg once daily is as effective as lisinopril 20 mg once daily in reducing blood pressure and microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Combination treatment is well tolerated and more effective in reducing blood pressure.
Summary 1: The CALM study included 199 patients with hypertension, micro-albuminuria, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and demonstrated significantly greater attenuation of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and significantly improved blood pressure control with combination therapy compared with either therapy alone.

Query 2: Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document 2: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P<0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.
Summary 2: In ValHeFT, 5010 patients with systolic dysfunction were randomized to the ARB valsartan or placebo in addition to background therapy, which included an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor in 93% of subjects. The primary endpoints were mortality and combined mortality and morbidity. An increase in mortality was found among patients on the triple therapy combination of valsartan, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a beta-blocker (relative risk [RR]=1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.9). Among those not on beta-blockers, adding valsartan to baseline therapy of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor resulted in a modest improvement in the combined endpoint (RR=0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), but no change in mortality alone was found.

Query: Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity among patients with myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure, or both. In a double-blind trial, we compared the effect of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan, the ACE inhibitor captopril, and the combination of the two on mortality in this population of patients. Patients receiving conventional therapy were randomly assigned, 0.5 to 10 days after acute myocardial infarction, to additional therapy with valsartan (4909 patients), valsartan plus captopril (4885 patients), or captopril (4909 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause. During a median follow-up of 24.7 months, 979 patients in the valsartan group died, as did 941 patients in the valsartan-and-captopril group and 958 patients in the captopril group (hazard ratio in the valsartan group as compared with the captopril group, 1.00; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.11; P=0.98; hazard ratio in the valsartan-and-captopril group as compared with the captopril group, 0.98; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.09; P=0.73). The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5 percent confidence interval for the comparison of the valsartan group with the captopril group was within the prespecified margin for noninferiority with regard to mortality (P=0.004) and with regard to the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (P<0.001). The valsartan-and-captopril group had the most drug-related adverse events. With monotherapy, hypotension and renal dysfunction were more common in the valsartan group, and cough, rash, and taste disturbance were more common in the captopril group. Valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. Combining valsartan with captopril increased the rate of adverse events without improving survival.
Summary:",The VALIANT demonstrated the safety but the lack of incremental efficacy in adding valsartan to ACE inhibitors for patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction.

Query 1: Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document 1: Additive hemodynamic effects of combined blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II antagonist have been observed in sodium-depleted normotensive volunteers and in patients with congestive heart failure. To investigate whether the same additive hemodynamic effects occur in patients with hypertension and to verify the safety of such an approach. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, pilot study. 177 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 95-115 mmHg after a 4-week placebo run-in period] were included in the study. Combination therapy consisting of 50 mg losartan daily and 10 mg enalapril daily was administered for 6 weeks. The effects of this therapeutic regimen was compared with similar groups of patients who received either 50 mg losartan daily or 10 mg enalapril daily. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP and clinic DBP measured at trough after 6 weeks of treatment. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP did not significantly differ between treatment groups although the combination tended to lower BP more. The combination therapy was more effective on clinic DBP measured at trough than was losartan by 3.2 mmHg [confidence interval (95%, CI) 0.7-5.7 mmHg, P = 0.012], and more effective than enalapril by 4.0 mmHg (95% CI, 1.5-6.4 mmHg, P = 0.002). In a subgroup of 28 patients, higher plasma active renin and angiotensin I levels during blockade by the combination therapy were observed. This finding confirmed that the combination of the two agents inhibited the renin-angiotensin system to a greater extent than did either agent alone. A combination of 10 mg enalapril daily and 50 mg losartan daily safely induces a supplementary, although modest, fall in clinic DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.
Summary 1: One trial of 177 patients found no significant difference in 24-hour ambulatory mean diastolic blood pressure with combination therapy vs angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or ARB monotherapy, but did show a decrease in clinic diastolic blood pressure.

Query: Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document: Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have favourable effects on haemodynamic measurements, neurohumoral activity, and left-ventricular remodelling when added to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We aimed to find out whether these drugs improve clinical outcome. Between March, 1999, and November, 1999, we enrolled 2548 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40% or lower, and who were being treated with ACE inhibitors. We randomly assigned patients candesartan (n=1276, target dose 32 mg once daily) or placebo (n=1272). At baseline, 55% of patients were also treated with beta blockers and 17% with spironolactone. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat. The median follow-up was 41 months. 483 (38%) patients in the candesartan group and 538 (42%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.85 [95% CI 0.75-0.96], p=0.011; covariate adjusted p=0.010). Candesartan reduced each of the components of the primary outcome significantly, as well as the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. The benefits of candesartan were similar in all predefined subgroups, including patients receiving baseline beta blocker treatment. The addition of candesartan to ACE inhibitor and other treatment leads to a further clinically important reduction in relevant cardiovascular events in patients with CHF and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction.
Summary:","In CHARM, candesartan was added to baseline therapy among patients with heart failure. Baseline therapy included diuretics (90%), beta blockers (55%), spironolactone (17%), and other cardiovascular medications as necessary. In this study, those in the treatment arm had a decrease in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death plus congestive heart failure admission (RR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96), but no difference was seen in overall mortality. Of note, no adverse interaction was demonstrated for those on the triple combination of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta-blockers."

Query: Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful?
Document: Present angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor treatment fails to prevent progression of non-diabetic renal disease. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker, and monotherapy of each drug at its maximum dose, in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. 336 patients with non-diabetic renal disease were enrolled from one renal outpatient department in Japan. After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomly assigned angiotensin-II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses. Survival analysis was done to compare the effects of each regimen on the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease. Analysis was by intention to treat. Seven patients discontinued or were otherwise lost to follow-up. Ten (11%) of 85 patients on combination treatment reached the combined primary endpoint compared with 20 (23%) of 85 on trandolapril alone (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.63, p=0.018) and 20 (23%) of 86 on losartan alone (0.40, 0.17-0.69, p=0.016). Covariates affecting renal survival were combination treatment (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.63, p=0.011), age (1.30, 1.03-2.29, p=0.009), baseline renal function (1.80, 1.02-2.99, p=0.021), change in daily urinary protein excretion rate (0.58, 0.24-0.88, p=0.022), use of diuretics (0.80, 0.30-0.94, p=0.043), and antiproteinuric response to trandolapril (0.81, 0.21-0.91, p=0.039). Frequency of side-effects with combination treatment was the same as with trandolapril alone. Combination treatment safely retards progression of non-diabetic renal disease compared with monotherapy. However, since some patients reached the combined primary endpoint on combined treatment, further strategies for complete management of progressive non-diabetic renal disease need to be researched.
Summary:",The COOPERATE trial was conducted in Japan and included 336 patients with nondiabetic renal disease. The investigators found that significantly fewer patients receiving combination therapy reached the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease compared with patients receiving monotherapy.

Query 1: Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk?
Document 1: Population-based longitudinal studies of hypertension have usually shown a continuous and positive relationship between blood pressure and mortality. However, several studies in hypertensive patients receiving treatment have described this relationship as J-shaped, with an increased risk for events in patients with low blood pressure. To assess the evidence for a J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and mortality and its relation to treatment. Meta-analysis of individual-patient data. Seven randomized clinical trials from the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention) database. 40 233 persons with hypertension (mean follow-up, 3.9 years). Primarily beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics versus placebo or no treatment. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure and number of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and all-cause deaths in yearly periods of follow-up. The analysis included data on 1655 deaths (56% cardiovascular). A J-shaped relationship between diastolic blood pressure and risk for death was observed for total and cardiovascular mortality in treated patients (nadir, 84 and 80 mm Hg, respectively) and untreated patients (nadir, 90 and 85 mm Hg, respectively). For noncardiovascular deaths, the relationship was J-shaped in the treated group (nadir, 84 mm Hg) and negative in the control group. Similar results were observed for systolic blood pressure. The presence of patients with wide pulse pressure did not explain these findings. The increased risk for events observed in patients with low blood pressure was not related to antihypertensive treatment and was not specific to blood pressure-related events. Poor health conditions leading to low blood pressure and an increased risk for death probably explain the J-shaped curve.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials involving 40,233 hypertensive patients used statistical modeling to determine the shape of the ""mortality curve"" over a range of diastolic blood pressure categories, defined in 10-mm Hg increments from 65 to 106. The subjects received mainly beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics; controls received placebo or no treatment. Both groups demonstrated increased risk for cardiovascular and all-cause death at the lowest diastolic blood pressure levels. Among treated patients, overall death rate was lowest with a diastolic blood pressure in the range of 76 to 85 mm Hg; among controls the nadir was 86 to 95 mm Hg.

Query 2: How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension?
Document 2: Many randomised trials assessing the effect of salt reduction on blood pressure show reduction in blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure. However, there is controversy about the magnitude and the clinical significance of the fall in blood pressure in individuals with normal blood pressure. Several meta-analyses of randomised salt reduction trials have been published in the last few years. However, most of these included trials of very short duration (e.g. 5 days) and included trials with salt loading followed by salt deprivation (e.g. from 20 to 1 g/day) over only a few days. These short-term experiments are not appropriate to inform public health policy which is for a modest reduction in salt intake over a prolonged period of time. A meta-analysis by Hooper et al is an important attempt to look at whether advice to achieve a long-term salt reduction (i.e. more than 6 months) in randomised trials causes a fall in blood pressure. However, most trials included in this meta-analysis achieved a small reduction in salt intake; on average, salt intake was reduced by 2 g/day. It is, therefore, not surprising that this analysis showed a small fall in blood pressure, and that a dose-response to salt reduction was not demonstrable. To assess the effect of the currently recommended modest reduction in salt intake (WHO 2003; SACN 2003; Whelton 2002), on blood pressure in individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. To assess whether the magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure is dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in salt intake. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, and reference list of original and review articles. We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and a duration of 4 or more weeks. Data were extracted independently by two persons. Mean effect sizes were calculated using both fixed and random effect models using Review Manager 4.2.1 software. Weighted linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the change in urinary sodium and the change in blood pressure. We used funnel plots to detect publication and other biases in the meta-analysis. Seventeen trials in individuals with elevated blood pressure (n=734) and 11 trials in individuals with normal blood pressure (n=2220) were included. In individuals with elevated blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 78 mmol (4.6 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -4.97 mmHg (95%CI:-5.76 to -4.18), and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -2.74 mmHg (95% CI:-3.22 to -2.26). In individuals with normal blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 74 mmol (4.4 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -2.03 mmHg (95% CI: -2.56 to -1.50) mmHg, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -0.99 mmHg (-1.40 to -0.57). Weighted linear regression analyses showed a correlation between the reduction in urinary sodium and the reduction in blood pressure. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake for a duration of 4 or more weeks has a significant and, from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in both individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. These results support other evidence suggesting that a modest and long-term reduction in population salt intake could reduce strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure. Furthermore, our meta-analysis demonstrates a correlation between the magnitude of salt reduction and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Within the daily intake range of 3 to 12 g/day, the lower the salt intake achieved, the lower the blood pressure.
Summary 2: A Cochrane review of 17 trials with 734 participants concluded that for individuals with hypertension, a reduced-salt diet results in a mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 5 mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, respectively.

Query: Does lowering diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk?
Document: There are 14 unconfounded randomised trials of antihypertensive drugs (chiefly diuretics or beta-blockers): total 37,000 individuals, mean treatment duration 5 years, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) difference 5-6 mm Hg. In prospective observational studies, a long-term difference of 5-6 mm Hg in usual DBP is associated with about 35-40% less stroke and 20-25% less coronary heart disease (CHD). For those dying in the trials, the DBP difference had persisted only 2-3 years, yet an overview showed that vascular mortality was significantly reduced (2p less than 0.0002); non-vascular mortality appeared unchanged. Stroke was reduced by 42% SD 6 (95% confidence interval 35-50%; 289 vs 484 events, 2p less than 0.0001), suggesting that virtually all the epidemiologically expected stroke reduction appears rapidly. CHD was reduced by 14% SD 5 (95% CI 4-22%; 671 vs 771 events, 2p less than 0.01), suggesting that just over half the epidemiologically expected CHD reduction appears rapidly. Although this significant CHD reduction could well be worthwhile, its size remains indefinite for most circumstances (though beta-blockers after myocardial infarction are of substantial benefit). At present, therefore, a sufficiently high risk of stroke (perhaps because of age, blood pressure, or, in particular, history of cerebrovascular disease) may be the clearest indication for antihypertensive treatment.
Summary:","The concept of a continuous graded relationship between DBP and cardiovascular risk is supported by a meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials showing that lowering DBP by 6 mm Hg reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-22%; P<.01; NNT=200). Throughout the range of DBP in study subjects, 70-115 mm Hg, a lower DBP was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease."

Query 1: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 1: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 1: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query 2: Do statins reduce the risk of stroke?
Document 2: Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first ""major vascular event"" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, ""intention-to-treat""), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.
Summary 2: The Heart Protection Study followed 20,536 patients in the United Kingdom (aged 40-80 years), 3280 with a history of cerebrovascular disease (defined as nondisabling stroke, transient cerebral ischemic attack, or carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty) and 17,256 with other occlusive arterial disease, coronary artery disease, or diabetes. Patients were randomized to receive either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for an average of 5 years. The endpoint was major vascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke of any type, and revascularization procedure. Simvastatin reduced the combined risk of non-fatal or fatal ischemic stroke for patients with no history of cerebrovascular disease (3.2% for simvastatin vs 4.8% with placebo; relative risk reduction=33%, number needed to treat [NNT]=63; P=.0001).

Query: Do statins reduce the risk of stroke?
Document: The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome. No study, however, has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic. Of 19342 hypertensive patients (aged 40-79 years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, 10305 with non-fasting total cholesterol concentrations 6.5 mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study. We planned follow-up for an average of 5 years, the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Data were analysed by intention to treat. Treatment was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, 100 primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with 154 events in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.83], p=0.0005). This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Fatal and non-fatal stroke (89 atorvastatin vs 121 placebo, 0.73 [0.56-0.96], p=0.024), total cardiovascular events (389 vs 486, 0.79 [0.69-0.90], p=0.0005), and total coronary events (178 vs 247, 0.71 [0.59-0.86], p=0.0005) were also significantly lowered. There were 185 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 212 in the placebo group (0.87 [0.71-1.06], p=0.16). Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about 1.3 mmol/L compared with placebo at 12 months, and by 1.1 mmol/L after 3 years of follow-up. The reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large, given the short follow-up time. These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines.
Summary:","The ASCOT-LLA study compared atorvastatin with placebo in 10,305 hypertensive Caucasian patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and a total nonfasting cholesterol of 250 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) or less. Patients were aged 40 to 79 years and had at least 3 other cardiovascular risk factors (left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal electrocardiogram, type 2 diabetes, peripheral artery disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, male sex, age >55 years, proteinuria or microalbuminuria, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease). The study was stopped early at a median of 3.3 years because atorvastatin significantly reduced cardiac events. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced ischemic strokes when compared with placebo (relative risk [RR]=0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.96; P=.024). This study did not differentiate between first or second stroke. The NNT was 155."

Query 1: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document 1: Adjusted-dose warfarin is effective for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), but the risk of bleeding is high, especially among the elderly. Fixed minidose warfarin is effective in preventing venous thromboembolism with low risk of bleeding and no need for frequent clinical monitoring. Patients > 60 years with nonrheumatic AF were randomized in an open-labeled trial to receive fixed minidose warfarin (1.25 mg/day) or standard adjusted-dose warfarin (International Normalized Ratio [INR] between 2.0 and 3.0). Primary outcome events were ischemic stroke, peripheral or visceral embolism, cerebral or fatal bleeding, and vascular death. Secondary end points were major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death. This study was discontinued before completion in light of publication of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III trial, which indicated that low-intensity fixed-dose warfarin treatment (i.e., INR < 1.5) was insufficient for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with nonrheumatic AF. From a total of 1,209 considered patients, 303 were randomized to be studied (150 in the minidose group and 153 in the adjusted-dose group). Mean follow-up was 14.5 months. The rate of cumulative primary events was 11.1% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 4.0 to 18.2) in the fixed minidose group and 6.1% (95% CI 1.1 to 11.1) in the adjusted-dose group (p = 0.29). The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the minidose group (3.7% vs 0% per year, p = 0.025). Major bleedings were more frequent in standard treatment group (2.6% vs 1% per year, p = 0.19). Most thromboembolic complications occurred at INRs < 1.2, whereas the majority of hemorrhages occurred at INRs > 3.0. No significant difference in primary outcome events was observed in the abbreviated study. However, the significantly increased occurrence of ischemic stroke in the fixed minidose warfarin group suggests that this regimen does not protect patients with nonrheumatic AF.
Summary 1: Pengo et al randomized patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation aged >60 years to fixed-dose (1.25 mg/d) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR=2.0-3.0) to evaluate ischemic stroke rates and major bleeding. This trial enrolled 303 patients who were followed up for 14.5 months before discontinuation of the trial. The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the fixed-dose warfarin group compared with the adjusted warfarin group (3.7% vs 0% per year; NNT=27). Major bleeds were more frequent in the adjusted warfarin group (2.6% vs 1% per year, number needed to harm=63). While the combined primary endpoint did not show a significant benefit for adjusted-dose warfarin, this study suggests that fixed-dose warfarin does not protect against ischemic stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.

Query 2: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document 2: Adjusted-dose warfarin is highly efficacious for prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this treatment carries a risk of bleeding and the need for frequent medical monitoring. We sought an alternative that would be safer and easier to administer to patients with AF who are at high-risk of thromboembolism. 1044 patients with AF and with at least one thromboembolic risk factor (congestive heart failure or left ventricular fractional shortening < or = 25%, previous thromboembolism, systolic blood pressure of more than 160 mm Hg at study enrollment, or being a woman aged over 75 years) were randomly assigned either a combination of low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin (international normalised ratio [INR] 1.2-1.5 for initial dose adjustment) and aspirin (325 mg/day) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Drugs were given open-labelled. The mean INR during follow-up of patients taking combination therapy (n = 521) was 1.3, compared with 2.4 for those taking adjusted-dose warfarin (n = 523). During follow-up, 54% of INRs in patients taking combination therapy were 1.2-1.5 and 34% were less than 1.2. The trial was stopped after a mean, follow-up of 1.1 years when the rate of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events) in patients given combination therapy (7.9% per year) was significantly higher than in those given adjusted-dose warfarin (1.9% per year) at an interim analysis (p < 0.0001), an absolute reduction of 6.0% per year (95% Cl 3.4, 8.6) by adjusted-dose warfarin. The annual rates of disabling stroke (5.6% vs 1.7%, p = 0.0007) and of primary event or vascular death (11.8% vs 6.4%, p = 0.002), were also higher with combination therapy. The rates of major bleeding were similar in both treatment groups. Low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in this regimen is insufficient for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF at high-risk for thromboembolism; adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) importantly reduces stroke for high-risk patients.
Summary 2: The stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation III investigators further compared adjusted-dose warfarin with low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in high-risk patients with NVAF. An interim analysis at 1.1 years revealed superiority in the reduction of ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms with adjusted-dose warfarin 7.9% vs 1.9% per year, respectively; NNT=16, which led to the trial's termination. Rates of major hemorrhage did not differ between treatment groups 2.4% per year with combination vs 2.1% per year with warfarin.

Query: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document: The incidence of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is greatly reduced by oral anticoagulation, with the full effect seen at international normalized ratio (INR) values of 2.0 or greater. The effect of the intensity of oral anticoagulation on the severity of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is not known but is central to the choice of the target INR. We studied incident ischemic strokes in a cohort of 13,559 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Strokes were identified through hospitalization data bases and validated on the basis of medical records, which also provided information on the use of warfarin or aspirin, the INR at admission, and coexisting illnesses. The severity of stroke was graded according to a modified Rankin scale. Thirty-day mortality was ascertained from hospitalization and mortality files. Of 596 ischemic strokes, 32 percent occurred during warfarin therapy, 27 percent during aspirin therapy, and 42 percent during neither type of therapy. Among patients who were taking warfarin, an INR of less than 2.0 at admission, as compared with an INR of 2.0 or greater, independently increased the odds of a severe stroke in a proportional-odds logistic-regression model (odds ratio, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.4) across three severity categories and the risk of death within 30 days (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 10.1). An INR of 1.5 to 1.9 at admission was associated with a mortality rate similar to that for an INR of less than 1.5 (18 percent and 15 percent, respectively). The 30-day mortality rate among patients who were taking aspirin at the time of the stroke was similar to that among patients who were taking warfarin and who had an INR of less than 2.0. Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation that results in an INR of 2.0 or greater reduces not only the frequency of ischemic stroke but also its severity and the risk of death from stroke. Our findings provide further evidence against the use of lower INR target levels in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Summary:","The intensity of warfarin therapy and stroke severity has recently been studied for patients with NVAF. A subtherapeutic INR (<2.0) on the day of admission was independently associated with severe stroke (odds ratio=1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.4), and risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.1) compared with an INR of 2.0 or greater. Furthermore, an admission INR of 1.5-1.9 had a similar mortality rate (18%) as an INR of <1.5 (15%), and for those patients on aspirin (15%)."

The trial was stopped after a mean, follow-up of 1.1 years when the rate of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events) in patients given combination therapy (7.9% per year) was significantly higher than in those given adjusted-dose warfarin (1.9% per year) at an interim analysis (p < 0.0001), an absolute reduction of 6.0% per year (95% Cl 3.4, 8.6) by adjusted-dose warfarin. The annual rates of disabling stroke (5.6% vs 1.7%, p = 0.0007) and of primary event or vascular death (11.8% vs 6.4%, p = 0.002), were also higher with combination therapy. The rates of major bleeding were similar in both treatment groups. Low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in this regimen is insufficient for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF at high-risk for thromboembolism; adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) importantly reduces stroke for high-risk patients.
Summary 1: The stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation III investigators further compared adjusted-dose warfarin with low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in high-risk patients with NVAF. An interim analysis at 1.1 years revealed superiority in the reduction of ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms with adjusted-dose warfarin 7.9% vs 1.9% per year, respectively; NNT=16, which led to the trial's termination. Rates of major hemorrhage did not differ between treatment groups 2.4% per year with combination vs 2.1% per year with warfarin.

Query 2: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document 2: Adjusted-dose warfarin is effective for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), but the risk of bleeding is high, especially among the elderly. Fixed minidose warfarin is effective in preventing venous thromboembolism with low risk of bleeding and no need for frequent clinical monitoring. Patients > 60 years with nonrheumatic AF were randomized in an open-labeled trial to receive fixed minidose warfarin (1.25 mg/day) or standard adjusted-dose warfarin (International Normalized Ratio [INR] between 2.0 and 3.0). Primary outcome events were ischemic stroke, peripheral or visceral embolism, cerebral or fatal bleeding, and vascular death. Secondary end points were major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death. This study was discontinued before completion in light of publication of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III trial, which indicated that low-intensity fixed-dose warfarin treatment (i.e., INR < 1.5) was insufficient for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with nonrheumatic AF. From a total of 1,209 considered patients, 303 were randomized to be studied (150 in the minidose group and 153 in the adjusted-dose group). Mean follow-up was 14.5 months. The rate of cumulative primary events was 11.1% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 4.0 to 18.2) in the fixed minidose group and 6.1% (95% CI 1.1 to 11.1) in the adjusted-dose group (p = 0.29). The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the minidose group (3.7% vs 0% per year, p = 0.025). Major bleedings were more frequent in standard treatment group (2.6% vs 1% per year, p = 0.19). Most thromboembolic complications occurred at INRs < 1.2, whereas the majority of hemorrhages occurred at INRs > 3.0. No significant difference in primary outcome events was observed in the abbreviated study. However, the significantly increased occurrence of ischemic stroke in the fixed minidose warfarin group suggests that this regimen does not protect patients with nonrheumatic AF.
Summary 2: Pengo et al randomized patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation aged >60 years to fixed-dose (1.25 mg/d) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR=2.0-3.0) to evaluate ischemic stroke rates and major bleeding. This trial enrolled 303 patients who were followed up for 14.5 months before discontinuation of the trial. The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the fixed-dose warfarin group compared with the adjusted warfarin group (3.7% vs 0% per year; NNT=27). Major bleeds were more frequent in the adjusted warfarin group (2.6% vs 1% per year, number needed to harm=63). While the combined primary endpoint did not show a significant benefit for adjusted-dose warfarin, this study suggests that fixed-dose warfarin does not protect against ischemic stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.

Query: Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
Document: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Six randomized studies of the use of oral anticoagulation therapy have demonstrated that the relative risk of stroke is decreased by approximately 68%. Three of these studies also compared aspirin with placebo use in a double-blind design. We pooled individual patient data from these 3 studies. To determine if there were subgroups of patients who were particularly responsive to aspirin use and to determine the efficacy of aspirin compared with placebo use in the broad spectrum of patients with AF. There were 1985 patient-years assigned to the aspirin and 1867 patient-years assigned to the placebo groups in the analysis. The daily dose of aspirin was 75 mg in the Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, Anticoagulation Study, 325 mg in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation 1 Study, and 300 mg in the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial. The European Atrial Fibrillation Trial was a secondary prevention trial, while the other 2 were primary prevention studies. The primary end point in this analysis was ischemic stroke. At the time of randomization, the patients' mean age was 70 years and the mean blood pressure was 145/83 mm Hg. Sixty-two percent of patients were male, 46% had a history of hypertension, 35% had a previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, and 19% had intermittent AF. Although aspirin use seemed particularly effective in younger patients and in those with hypertension in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation 1 Study, this was not the case in the other studies. No other subgroups particularly responsive to aspirin therapy were identified. When patients from all the studies were combined, the relative risk reduction with aspirin therapy was 21% (95% confidence interval, 0%-38%; P = .05). A subgroup of patients with AF that has a particularly large reduction in stroke incidence from aspirin therapy was not convincingly identified. The data from the combined analysis of these 3 randomized trials suggest a small effect of aspirin use in preventing stroke in patients with AF.
Summary:","Combined data from the Atrial Fibrillation Aspirin Anticoagulation Study (AFASAK-1), the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial, and the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) I studies revealed a small but statistically significant reduction in stroke rates (relative risk reduction [RRR]=21%; 8.1% vs 6.3% annual stroke rate; NNT=55), with no increase in major bleeding risk."

Query 1: What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection?
Document 1: To investigate the prevalence and clinical importance of urological abnormalities in men with community-acquired febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). In this prospective study, 85 men (median age 63 years, range 18--86) were followed for 1 year after an episode of febrile UTI. They were investigated by excretory urography, cysto-urethroscopy, uroflowmetry, digital rectal examination and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume by abdominal ultrasonography. The radiological examination of the upper urinary tract in 83 patients revealed 22 abnormal findings in 19 men. Relevant clinical abnormalities leading to surgical intervention were found in only one patient who had renal calyceal stones. The lower urinary tract investigation disclosed 46 findings in 35 men. In all, surgically correctable disorders were found in 20 patients, of whom 15 had previously unrecognized abnormalities. All patients who required surgery were identified either by a history of voiding difficulties, acute urinary retention at the time of infection, the presence of microscopic haematuria at follow-up after one month, or early recurrent symptomatic UTI. Routine imaging studies of the upper urinary tract seem dispensable in men with febrile UTI. To reveal abnormalities of clinical importance, any urological evaluation should primarily be focused on the lower urinary tract.
Summary 1: A small prospective study of 85 men, 18 to 86 years of age, with febrile UTI, concluded that routine imaging of the upper urinary tract was unnecessary, and that, if indicated, further workup should focus on the lower urinary tract. Abnormalities in this group were suggested by a history of voiding problems, hematuria, or recurrent infection. One limitation of this study was the incomplete urodynamic and endoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary tract.

Query 2: What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection?
Document 2: To determine in a prospective study whether urinary tract infection (UTI) in men younger than 45 years of age is associated with anomalies of the genitourinary tract that necessitate additional urologic evaluation. UTI in young men is uncommon. In these patients, it is customary to follow the same policy as that for children or older men and to routinely perform urologic investigations. Twenty-nine consecutive, otherwise healthy, male patients aged 16 to 45 years (mean 30.5) were hospitalized for a first event of acute UTI. All patients underwent an imaging evaluation, including ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Those with macroscopic hematuria underwent cystoscopy. Uroflowmetry was performed at least 1 month after recovery, and patients with a maximal flow rate of less than 15 mL/s underwent a pressure flow study. Significant urethral stricture was excluded in all patients. Twenty-seven patients (93%) had a postvoid residual urine volume of less than 20 mL, and only two had values of 120 and 200 mL. The imaging and cystoscopic evaluation demonstrated a normal urinary tract in all patients. The maximal urinary flow rate was greater than 15 mL/s in 22 patients (76%) and lower than 15 mL/s in 7 patients (24%). In the latter group, urodynamic investigations, including free flowmetry and/or pressure flow study, revealed normal lower urinary tract function in 6 patients and a bladder outflow obstruction in 1 (3%). A first event of UTI in men younger than 45 years is usually not associated with significant structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. Therefore, no radiologic, endoscopic, or urodynamic investigation is required.
Summary 2: The incidence in elderly men is high, often attributable to a bladder outflow obstruction. (For this review, the definition of urinary tract infection is limited to bacterial infections of the kidney, ureter, or bladder, and does not include urethritis, epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis.)

Query: What is the recommended workup for a man with a first UTI?
Document: Bacteriologic criteria for diagnosing urinary tract infections in men have not been well defined. For determination of the bacterial colony count in voided specimens that most accurately reflects bladder bacteriuria, culture results were compared for voided urine and bladder urine (obtained by suprapubic aspiration and urethral catheterization) from men with various genitourinary problems. Bladder bacteriuria was found in 36 (47.3%) of 76 sets of specimens from 66 individuals. Culture results of bladder specimens showed excellent agreement with those of clean-catch midstream-void and uncleansed first-void specimens (weighted kappa = 0.924 and 0.906, respectively). The criterion for clean-catch midstream-void specimens that best differentiated sterile from infected bladder urine was growth of greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu of one predominant species/ml; this definition had a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. Uncleansed first-void specimens were equally sensitive (0.97) but less specific (0.91-0.92) in detection of bacteriuria. Pyuria (greater than or equal to leukocytes/mm3) and irritative genitourinary symptoms showed modest correlations with bladder bacteriuria.
Summary:","A cohort of 66 men (mean age, 66±13 years) presenting to a VA urology clinic for procedures, dysuria, or bacteriuria had urine samples taken while voiding, as well as directly from the bladder, either via suprapubic aspiration or urethral catheterization. Using bladder cultures as a gold standard, midstream urine culture had a specificity and sensitivity of >97% at a threshold of 1000 CFU/mL."

Query 1: What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children?
Document 1: A prospective study was carried out by the Department of Ophthalmology and the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (CT) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for surgical drainage. Between February 1985 and January 1988, 23 patients with true orbital cellulitis were admitted. CT scans were ordered routinely at the time of admission. The scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. CT showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. Three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. The results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. CT should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.
Summary 1: In a prospective study to evaluate medical management (n=23), 87% of patients responded to intravenous antibiotics.

Document 2: The authors sought to determine whether the microbiologic spectrum of preseptal and orbital cellulitis had changed over the past decade. A retrospective chart review of all inpatient and outpatient children with an ICD-9 diagnosis of preseptal or orbital cellulitis seen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type-B (HiB) vaccine (1986-1996). Blood and abscess cultures from children with preseptal and orbital cellulitis were tabulated. During this period, 70 cases of preseptal cellulitis were seen. Blood cultures were obtained in 59 cases; only 6 were positive. Five cultures grew Streptococcus species. The one positive H. influenzae culture occurred in 1987 in a child who did not receive the HiB vaccine. There have been no new patients with preseptal cellulitis and H. influenzae bacteremia at Vanderbilt for 10 years. There were ten cases of orbital cellulitis, of which blood or abscess or both were cultured in eight. Six cases had positive cultures. Four cultures grew Streptococcus species. The other two grew H. influenzae and mixed H. influenzae/gram-positive cocci. The incidence of hemophilus-associated bacteremia in patients with preseptal cellulitis has decreased dramatically over the past 10 years. Streptococcus species now are the predominant cause. Orbital cellulitis due to H. influenzae may still occur, but it is much less likely. A more conservative approach to the diagnosis and management of preseptal and orbital cellulitis may be warranted.
Summary 2: A retrospective case series from Vanderbilt (n=80) found streptococci as the most common cause, based on blood and wound cultures in the Hib vaccination era; however, only 12 wounds returned positive cultures.

Query: What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children?
Document: Subperiosteal abscess may accompany orbital cellulitis secondary to sinusitis. Common surgical principles include incision and drainage of all abscesses. Previous evidence suggests that some orbital abscesses may be treatable with intravenous antibiotics, especially in young children. Children's hospital records were reviewed to determine which abscesses may be treated medically. Records of patients admitted for orbital cellulitis from 1993 to 1996 were reviewed. Patients with subperiosteal abscess on CT scan were included. Clinical outcomes for initial surgical versus medical management of medial abscesses were compared. Differences in age, hospital stay, and intracranial involvement were analyzed for medial versus nonmedial abscesses. All patients had abscesses adjacent to infected sinuses. Eighteen young children had medial abscesses. Twelve of 13 were cured by initial medical treatment; 4 of 5 underwent successful initial drainage. Outcomes were not statistically different (P > .490). Seven children with nonmedial abscesses were older (P < .001) and had more complicated courses than those with medial abscess. Three of 6 children with superior orbital abscess also had intracranial abscess. Intracranial complication was more likely with superior versus medial orbital abscess (P < .01). Medial subperiosteal orbital abscesses secondary to sinusitis in children 6 years of age and younger are highly amenable to treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Older children and children with nonmedial abscesses may have more complicated infections. Children with superior orbital abscesses are at higher risk for intracranial abscess.
Summary:",No statistically significant long-term difference in subperiosteal abscesses (as a complication of orbital cellulitis) was found in a retrospective study comparing medical to surgical management.

Document 2: Preseptal and orbital cellulitis range in severity from minor to potentially severe complications. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical features of patients with preseptal or orbital cellulitis in one medical center in Taiwan, and to assess the effectiveness of treatments and the complications. Patients admitted between 1996 and 2005 to Taipei Veterans General Hospital under the diagnosis of preseptal or orbital cellulitis were retrospectively reviewed. The demographics, administrative history, past history, clinical presentations, treatments, and complications were analyzed. In total, 94 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for preseptal or orbital cellulitis were identified (67 had preseptal cellulitis, 27 had orbital cellulitis). While paranasal sinus disease was the most common predisposing cause in orbital cases, skin lesions in children and dacryocystitis in adults were the most common in preseptal cases. Microbiologic investigations showed variable results, but the most common pathogen isolated was Staphylococcus aureus. Cultures from eye swabs and local abscesses gave the highest positive yield. Blood cultures were taken in some patients, but the positive rate was extremely low. Treatments included intravenous antibiotics alone, or intravenous antibiotics combined with surgical drainage. Only one case had permanent ocular motility impairment after removal of the orbital foreign body. Despite the past history of potential morbidity and even mortality from orbital cellulitis, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with proper antibiotics and/or surgical intervention can achieve a good prognosis.
Summary 2: A retrospective case series of 94 patients of all ages in China implicated Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal species based on cultures taken from eye purulence and abscesses.

Query: What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children?
Document: To determine the appropriate early management of orbital cellulitis and the current bacterial etiology and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of orbital computed tomographic imaging for this infection, a prospective study of orbital cellulitis was conducted during a 2-year period, 1999 to 2000, after the introduction of a conservative medical management plan designed by our pediatric infectious diseases, ophthalmology and otolaryngology services. Basically patients did not have surgical intervention unless progressive involvement of the optic nerve occurred after 24 to 36 h of intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Nine patients had orbital cellulitis and subperiosteal abscesses; only one required surgical drainage because of progressive disease, this case being culture-negative. One had a blood culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae; conjunctival cultures showed moderate to heavy growth for S. pneumoniae from this and two other patients, but otherwise bacterial etiology could not be defined. Haemophilus influenzae was not recovered from any of their blood or conjunctival cultures. This experience, during the computed tomography scan and Haemophilus vaccine era, supports an initial medical management approach for most patients with subperiosteal or retrobulbar abscesses resulting in orbital cellulitis.
Summary:","A small case series (n=9) found 21 children admitted to hospital for preseptal cellulitis, of whom 4 later were diagnosed with orbital cellulitis. There was a total of 9 cases of orbital cellulitis; however, only 1 required operative management of orbital cellulitis."

Query 1: What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders?
Document 1: Many case-finding instruments are available to help primary care physicians (PCPs) diagnose depression, but they are not widely used. Physicians often consider these instruments too time consuming or feel they do not provide sufficient diagnostic information. Our study examined the validity and utility of the Quick PsychoDiagnostics (QPD) Panel, an automated mental health test designed to meet the special needs of PCPs. The test screens for 9 common psychiatric disorders and requires no physician time to administer or score. We evaluated criterion validity relative to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and evaluated convergent validity by correlating QPD Panel scores with established mental health measures. Sensitivity to change was examined by readministering the test to patients pretreatment and posttreatment. Utility was evaluated through physician and patient satisfaction surveys. For major depression, sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 96%, respectively. For other disorders, sensitivities ranged from 69% to 98%, and specificities ranged from 90% to 97%. The depression severity score correlated highly with the Beck, Hamilton, Zung, and CES-D depression scales, and the anxiety score correlated highly with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90 (Ps <.001). The test was sensitive to change. All PCPs agreed or strongly agreed that the QPD Panel ""is convenient and easy to use,"" ""can be used immediately by any physician,"" and ""helps provide better patient care."" Patients also rated the test favorably. The QPD Panel is a valid mental health assessment tool that can diagnose a range of common psychiatric disorders and is practical for routine use in primary care.
Summary 1: The QPD reports an excellent positive likelihood ratio and good negative likelihood ratio for panic disorder. As mentioned above, these results are limited by the quality of its sample size and the expense.

Query 2: What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders?
Document 2: The research literature is replete with evidence of and concerns about the prevalence and undertreatment of mental disorders in primary care. Although screening, on its own, may not directly affect clinical outcomes, it is still the most efficient and effective way to identify psychologically distressed patients for either research purposes or to provide patients with or refer patients to appropriate care. The current study sought to establish the utility of the MHI-5 for the detection of patients suffering from major depression or panic disorder, two of the most common psychiatric conditions seen in primary care settings. This study was conducted in a family medicine clinic and 246 adult outpatients participated. Patients completed the Mental Health Index-5 (MHI-5) as the screening measure and the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) as the diagnostic instrument. ROC analyses indicated that a cut-off score of 23 on the MHI-5 yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 58% for predicting provisional diagnoses of major depression or panic disorder from the PHQ. Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of major depression yielded a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 62% and a second question had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 63% for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder. These results indicate that it is possible to use a small number of items to efficiently and effectively screen for mental disorders affecting a significant portion of primary care patients.
Summary 2: The MHI-5 screens for panic disorder with a single item taken from a larger questionnaire for panic disorder and depression. It has 100% sensitivity but a poor positive likelihood ratio. The sample size was very small-only 9 persons with panic disorder were tested.

Query 1: In menopausal women, does fatigue indicate disease?
Document 1: Data remain sparse on women's prodromal symptoms before acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study describes prodromal and AMI symptoms in women. Participants were 515 women diagnosed with AMI from 5 sites. Using the McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey, we surveyed them 4 to 6 months after discharge, asking about symptoms, comorbidities, and demographic characteristics. Women were predominantly white (93%), high school educated (54.8%), and older (mean age, 66+/-12), with 95% (n=489) reporting prodromal symptoms. The most frequent prodromal symptoms experienced more than 1 month before AMI were unusual fatigue (70.7%), sleep disturbance (47.8%), and shortness of breath (42.1%). Only 29.7% reported chest discomfort, a hallmark symptom in men. The most frequent acute symptoms were shortness of breath (57.9%), weakness (54.8%), and fatigue (42.9%). Acute chest pain was absent in 43%. Women had more acute (mean, 7.3+/-4.8; range, 0 to 29) than prodromal (mean, 5.71+/-4.36; range, 0 to 25) symptoms. The average prodromal score, symptom weighted by frequency and intensity, was 58.5+/-52.7, whereas the average acute score, symptom weighted by intensity, was 16.5+/-12.1. These 2 scores were correlated (r=0.61, P<0.001). Women with more prodromal symptoms experienced more acute symptoms. After controlling for risk factors, prodromal scores accounted for 33.2% of acute symptomatology. Most women have prodromal symptoms before AMI. It remains unknown whether prodromal symptoms are predictive of future events.
Summary 1: A retrospective study of 515 women 4 to 6 months after a myocardial infarction explored self-reported symptoms. The mean age was 66±12 years and 93% were white. Unusual fatigue was the most frequent prodromal symptom experienced by 70.7% of women 1 month before a myocardial infarction, with 42.9% reporting fatigue in the acute setting. Though this retrospective study is limited both by its methodological quality and by the narrow population studied, the results suggest a gender difference between men and women in their report of symptoms of coronary artery disease.

Query 2: Does tamoxifen prevent breast cancer?
Document 2: Tamoxifen, a drug with antioestrogenic effects, is predicted to prevent the occurrence of breast cancer. We have undertaken a trial of tamoxifen in healthy women who are at increased risk of breast cancer because of family history. We report a planned interim analysis. Between October, 1986, and April, 1996, we accrued 2494 healthy women aged between 30 and 70 with a family history of breast cancer. They have been randomised (double blind) to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally or placebo for up to 8 years. Follow-up included clinical assessment, annual mammography, and assessment of toxicity and compliance. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of breast cancer, which was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a survival curve. With a median follow-up of 70 months, 2471 women (tamoxifen 1238, placebo 1233) were suitable for analysis. The groups were evenly matched at baseline, and compliance was good. The overall frequency of breast cancer is the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen 34, placebo 36, relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.7-1.7], p=0.8). Participants who were already on hormone-replacement therapy when they entered the study had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-users. Those participants who started such therapy while on trial had a significantly reduced risk. The safety profile of tamoxifen was as expected. We have been unable to show any effect of tamoxifen on breast-cancer incidence in healthy women, contrary to the report from the NSABP-P1 study showing a 45% reduction in healthy women given tamoxifen versus placebo. Differences in the study populations for the two trials may underlie these conflicting findings: eligibility in our trial was based predominantly on a strong family history of breast cancer whereas in the NSABP trial was mostly based on non-genetic risk factors. The importance of oestrogen promotion may vary between such populations.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials reported no benefit from tamoxifen in young women with at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer. hormone replacement therapy was allowed, and the study had 90% power to detect a reduction of 50% in breast cancer incidence. Authors estimated that 36% of participants and 60% of women who developed breast cancer had a greater than 80% chance of having a breast cancer predisposition gene. Breast cancers in women with the Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) are more likely to be extended-release negative.

Query: What is the best way to diagnose menopause?
Document: To assess whether menstrual variability predicts time to menopause. Analyses drew on 326 menstruating women, aged 44 to 56, who were followed until they reached menopause or the study ended. The women provided data on their menstrual characteristics at intake. We evaluated the utility of six definitions of menstrual variability for predicting time to ascertained menopause (final menstrual period + 12 months): (1) more than 90 days since the most recent menstrual period (n = 20); (2) 60 or more days of amenorrhea during the previous year (n = 71); (3) cycle lengths that varied by 19 or more days (n = 106); (4) cycle lengths too variable to report a usual length (n = 29); (5) cycles less regular than they had been at age 40 (n = 107); and (6) change in the duration or heaviness of menstrual flow compared with age 40 (n = 255). In addition, we evaluated hot flashes or night sweats during the previous week (n = 50) and age 50 or more years (n = 60) as predictors. Definitions 1 to 5 predicted time to menopause; definition 6 did not. Definition 1 had the highest positive predictive value for ascertained menopause within 2 years and within 4 years; definitions 2 and 4 had low to moderate positive predictive values for ascertained menopause within 2 years but good positive predictive values for ascertained menopause within 4 years. For ascertained menopause within 2 years, definition 2 showed the best balance of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (91%). Simple questions about menstrual variability elicit information that is informative about proximity to menopause.
Summary:",Change in the amount of flow is more sensitive but less specific (sensitivity=0.81; specificity=0.30; LR+=1.15; LR-=0.65).

Query 1: Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer?
Document 1: Pooled analyses of cohort studies show no relation between fat intake and breast-cancer risk. However, food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) methods used in these studies are prone to measurement error. We assessed diet with an FFQ and a detailed 7-day food diary in 13070 women between 1993 and 1997. We compared 168 breast-cancer cases incident by 2000 with four matched controls. Risk of breast cancer was associated with saturated-fat intake measured with the food diary (hazard ratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.06-1.40], p=0.005, per quintile increase in energy-adjusted fat intake), but not with saturated fat measured with the FFQ (1.10 [0.94-1.29], p=0.23). Dietary measurement error might explain the absence of a significant association between dietary fat and breast-cancer risk in cohort studies.
Summary 1: Case-control studies have shown some minimally increased risk related to dietary fat consumption, but there is concern about recall bias in these studies.

Query 2: Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults?
Document 2: Obesity in the United States has increased dramatically during the past several decades. There is debate about optimum calorie balance for prevention of weight gain, and proponents of some low-carbohydrate diet regimens have suggested that the increasing obesity may be attributed, in part, to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. To report data on body weight in a long-term, low-fat diet trial for which the primary end points were breast and colorectal cancer and to examine the relationships between weight changes and changes in dietary components. Randomized intervention trial of 48,835 postmenopausal women in the United States who were of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities and participated in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial; 40% (19,541) were randomized to the intervention and 60% (29,294) to a control group. Study enrollment was between 1993 and 1998, and this analysis includes a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (through August 31, 2004). The intervention included group and individual sessions to promote a decrease in fat intake and increases in vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption and did not include weight loss or caloric restriction goals. The control group received diet-related education materials. Change in body weight from baseline to follow-up. Women in the intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg, P<.001) and maintained lower weight than control women during an average 7.5 years of follow-up (difference, 1.9 kg, P<.001 at 1 year and 0.4 kg, P = .01 at 7.5 years). No tendency toward weight gain was observed in intervention group women overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index. Weight loss was greatest among women in either group who decreased their percentage of energy from fat. A similar but lesser trend was observed with increases in vegetable and fruit servings, and a nonsignificant trend toward weight loss occurred with increasing intake of fiber. A low-fat eating pattern does not result in weight gain in postmenopausal women. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00000611.
Summary 2: The Women's Health Initiative studied 46,808 postmenopausal women between 50 and 79 years of age who were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received intensive group and individual counseling from dieticians aimed at reducing fat intake to 20%, increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits to 5 or more servings per day, and increasing consumption of grains to 6 or more servings per day. The control group received dietary education materials. Neither group had weight loss or calorie restriction goals or differences in physical activity. The intervention group had a mean decrease in weight 1.9 kg greater than the controls at 1 year (P<.001) and 0.4 kg at 7.5 years (P<.01). Weight loss was greater in women who consumed more fruits and vegetables and greatest among women who decreased energy intake from fat.

Query: Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer?
Document: Animal experiments and human ecological studies suggest that dietary fat intake is associated with a risk of breast cancer, but individual-based studies have given contradictory results. We have carried out a meta-analysis of this association to include all papers published up to July 2003. Case-control and cohort studies that examined the association of dietary fat, or fat-containing foods, with risk of breast cancer were identified. A total of 45 risk estimates for total fat intake were obtained. Descriptive data from each study were extracted with an estimate of relative risk and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI), and were analysed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. The summary relative risk, comparing the highest and lowest levels of intake of total fat, was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03-1.25). Cohort studies (N=14) had a summary relative risk of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.99-1.25) and case-control studies (N=31) had a relative risk of 1.14 (95% CI 0.99-1.32). Significant summary relative risks were also found for saturated fat (RR, 1.19; 95% CI: 1.06-1.35) and meat intake (RR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.29). Combined estimates of risk for total and saturated fat intake, and for meat intake, all indicate an association between higher intakes and an increased risk of breast cancer. Case-control and cohort studies gave similar results.
Summary:","The meta-analysis performed by Boyd et al did find a statistically significant difference, with relative risks ranging from 1.11 for overall to 1.19 for high-saturated-fat diets. The upper limit of all confidence intervals was no higher than 1.35, however, suggesting a lack of clinical significance."

Query: Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer?
Document: Preclinical and observational studies suggest a relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer, but the association remains controversial. We carried out a randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial to test the effect of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake in women with resected, early-stage breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. A total of 2437 women were randomly assigned between February 1994 and January 2001 in a ratio of 40:60 to dietary intervention (n = 975) or control (n = 1462) groups. An interim analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 60 months when funding for the intervention ceased. Mean differences between dietary intervention and control groups in nutrient intakes and anthropometric variables were compared with t tests. Relapse-free survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, stratified log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests were two-sided. Dietary fat intake was lower in the intervention than in the control group (fat grams/day at 12 months, 33.3 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 32.2 to 34.5] versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 to 52.7], respectively; P<.001), corresponding to a statistically significant (P = .005), 6-pound lower mean body weight in the intervention group. A total of 277 relapse events (local, regional, distant, or ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral breast cancer) have been reported in 96 of 975 (9.8%) women in the dietary group and 181 of 1462 (12.4%) women in the control group. The hazard ratio of relapse events in the intervention group compared with the control group was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98, P = .077 for stratified log rank and P = .034 for adjusted Cox model analysis). Exploratory analyses suggested a differential effect of the dietary intervention based on hormonal receptor status. A lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, with modest influence on body weight, may improve relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients receiving conventional cancer management. Longer, ongoing nonintervention follow-up will address original protocol design plans, which called for 3 years of follow-up after completion of recruitment.
Summary:","Recently, a nested study within the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study did show that women with breast cancer who decreased their fat intake to a median of 33 g/day had a hazard ratio of 0.76 for relapse over 60 months (compared with controls who ate a median of 51 g/day)."

Query 1: What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?
Document 1: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres including the Epley manoeuvre. To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2001), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1974 onwards), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was June 2001. Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: - Epley manoeuvre versus placebo. - Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls. Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment. Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a ""positive"" Dix-Hallpike test to a ""negative"" Dix-Hallpike test Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Eleven trials were identified but nine studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving two trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. Both studies included in the review (Lynn 1995, Froehling 2000) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. ~bullet~There is some evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, although this is based on the results of only two small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. ~bullet~There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long term resolution of symptoms. ~bullet~There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.
Summary 1: Pooled data yielded odds ratios in favor of treatment for both objective testing (OR=5.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21-14.56) and symptom resolution (OR=4.92; 95% CI, 1.84-13.16), with no adverse outcomes reported.

Query 2: What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?
Document 2: Animal studies indicate that diazepam suppresses resting activity in the vestibular system. Despite lack of clinical studies, diazepam and lorazepam have been used empirically for relief of vertigo. However, drug use with benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is controversial which led to this study to evaluate the value of diazepam and lorazepam for relief of BPV. Twenty-five BPV patients were given diazepam, lorazepam, or a placebo over four weeks using a double-blind technique. Each patient rated his dizziness after each week, and the patient's nystagmus was rated before and after treatment. The result showed a gradual decline in symptoms in all treatment groups with no additional relief with the drugs. The latter was attributed to the fact that BPV represents a dynamic state whereas diazepam provides symptom relief due to action on the system in its static state.
Summary 2: Lorazepam and diazepam had no effect in 1 small randomized controlled trial. In this study, 25 benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients from specialty clinics were randomized to placebo, diazepam 5 mg, or lorazepam 1 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Patients reported dizziness on a 10-point scale at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy. Nystagmus severity was also assessed using a 10-point scale at baseline and within 2 days following completion of treatment. The authors found no significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms; however, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically significant difference.

Query 1: What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly?
Document 1: Patients with insomnia may experience one or more of the following problems: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning and nonrefreshing sleep. In addition, daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and irritability are often present. Approximately 10 percent of adults experience persistent insomnia, although most patients do not mention it during routine office visits. Asking sleep-related questions during the general review of systems and asking patients with sleep complaints to keep a sleep diary are helpful approaches in detecting insomnia. Behavior and pharmacologic therapies are used in treating insomnia. Behavior approaches take a few weeks to improve sleep but continue to provide relief even after training sessions have ended. Hypnotic medications are safe and effective in inducing, maintaining and consolidating sleep. Effective treatment of insomnia may improve the quality of life for many patients.
Summary 1: Most over-the-counter sleep aids contain diphen-hydramine, a long-acting antihistamine that is considered less effective than benzodiazepines. The anticholinergic properties of antihistamines can result in cognitive changes and urinary retention in the elderly

Query 1: What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly?
Document 1: Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.
Summary 1: They have been shown to decrease sleep latency, increase total sleep time, and increase sleep efficiency without disturbing sleep architecture or adversely affecting memory.

Query 1: Do statins cause myopathy?
Document 1: To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.
Summary 1: A tabular analysis of 74 published case reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis from a MEDLINE search covering 1985 to 2000 reported that in most cases the statin was safely restarted after stopping presumed interactive drugs (exact numbers not reported).

Query 2: Do statins cause myopathy?
Document 2: Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002 and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified via a PubMed search through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin. Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications. Medications such as the fibrate gemfibrozil alter statin metabolism and increase statin plasma concentration. How statins injure skeletal muscle is not clear, although recent evidence suggests that statins reduce the production of small regulatory proteins that are important for myocyte maintenance.
Summary 2: A pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials found similar myopathy rates in patients taking statins and placebo. Summarized myopathy data from 30 statin trials analyzed in a recent systematic review, shows similar myopathy rates in statin and placebo patients. There may be a lower myopathy rate in these trials than in routine clinical practice because of stricter exclusion criteria and more intense monitoring.

Query 1: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 1: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 1: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query 2: Do statins reduce the risk of stroke?
Document 2: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
Summary 2: The Heart Protection Study showed no difference in the number of hemorrhagic strokes between treatment and placebo groups. There were 3500 subjects with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dL; lowering low density lipoprotein to 65 mg/dL reduced major vascular event risk by about 25%.

Query: Do statins cause myopathy?
Document: This study presents the long-term safety data from AFCAPS/TexCAPS, the first primary prevention trial to demonstrate that men and women with average levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and below average levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) can significantly benefit from long-term treatment to lower LDL-C; lovastatin 20 to 40 mg/day reduced the risk of a first acute major coronary event (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden death) by 37% (p = 0.00008). This double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, in 6,605 generally healthy middle-aged and older men and women, had prespecified end point and cancer analyses. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Safety monitoring included history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (including hepatic transaminases and creatine phosphokinase [CPK]). All participants, even those who discontinued treatment, were contacted annually for vital status, cardiovascular events, and cancer history. After an average of 5.2 years of follow-up, there were 157 deaths (80 receiving lovastatin and 77 receiving placebo; relative risk [RR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.42; p = 0.82); of which 115 were noncardiovascular (RR 1.21; CI 0.84 to 1.74; p = 0.31), and of these, 82 were due to cancer (RR 1.41; CI 0.91 to 2.19; p = 0.13). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in overall cancer rates, discontinuations for noncardiovascular adverse experiences, or clinically important elevations of hepatic transaminases or CPK. Among those who used cytochrome P450 isoform (CYP3A4) inhibitors, there were no treatment group differences in the frequency of clinically important muscle-related adverse events. Treatment with lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for primary prevention of coronary heart disease was well tolerated and reduced the risk of first acute coronary events without increasing the risk of either noncardiovascular mortality or cancer.
Summary:","In the AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial, 20 of 21 statin patients (out of a study population of 3304) who had elevated creatine kinase (>10 times the upper limits of normal) recovered with continued lovastatin treatment, while the other patient resumed treatment after a brief interruption without further elevations."

Query 1: Should you use steroids to treat infectious mononucleosis?
Document 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of dexamethasone for pain relief in acute exudative pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pediatric emergency department-based clinical trial. Patients aged between 8 and 18 years with a sore throat from clinically suspected infectious mononucleosis were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg (maximum, 15 mg) of dexamethasone or a placebo. Patients completed a diary of symptoms and rated their pain on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 mm at 0 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and on day 7. An improvement of 20 mm from baseline on the visual analog scale was evaluated as the primary end point. Twenty patients were recruited in each group; mean +/- SD age was 13.5 +/- 2.8 years. In comparison with the placebo group, a significantly greater proportion of patients given dexamethasone achieved pain relief within the first 12 hours (12/20 vs 5/19; P =.03). On further follow-up, the proportions achieving pain relief were similar between groups: 11 of 20 vs 6 of 20 at 24 hours (P =.10); 11 of 20 vs 11 of 20 at 48 hours (P>.99); 15 of 20 vs 15 of 19 at 72 hours (P =.93); and 18 of 19 vs 19 of 20 at day 7 (P>.99), with dexamethasone vs placebo, respectively. The short-lived relief of pain in acute exudative pharyngitis in children with suspected infectious mononucleosis may suggest that a single oral dose of dexamethasone may not be sufficient and that additional doses may be necessary for ensuring lasting relief.
Summary 1: In an randomized controlled trials of 40 patients, 1 dose of dexamethasone reduced throat pain at 12 hours in 60% of the treatment group, compared with placebo. However, no significant differences were noted at 1 and 7 days.

Query 2: Should you use steroids to treat infectious mononucleosis?
Document 2: Ninety-four patients with infectious mononucleosis and symptoms < or = 7 days were randomized to treatment with oral acyclovir (800 mg 5 times/day) and prednisolone (0.7 mg/kg for the first 4 days, which was reduced by 0.1 mg/kg on consecutive days for another 6 days; n = 48), or placebo (n = 46) for 10 days. Oropharyngeal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) shedding was significantly inhibited during the treatment period (P = .02, Mann-Whitney rank test). No significant effect was observed for duration of general illness, sore throat, weight loss, or absence from school or work. The frequency of latent EBV-infected B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the HLA-restricted EBV-specific cellular immunity, measured 6 months after onset of disease, was not affected by treatment. Thus, acyclovir combined with prednisolone inhibited oropharyngeal EBV replication without affecting duration of clinical symptoms or development of EBV-specific cellular immunity.
Summary 2: A trial of combined therapy with acyclovir and prednisolone in 94 patients found no differences in resolution of sore throat, weight loss, and absence from school or work in the treatment group.

Query 1: When should we treat isolated high triglycerides?
Document 1: Coronary heart disease patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, high triglyceride levels, or both are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the clinical impact of raising HDL-C or decreasing triglycerides remains to be confirmed. In a double-blind trial, 3090 patients with a previous myocardial infarction or stable angina, total cholesterol of 180 to 250 mg/dL, HDL-C < or =45 mg/dL, triglycerides < or =300 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < or =180 mg/dL were randomized to receive either 400 mg of bezafibrate per day or a placebo; they were followed for a mean of 6.2 years. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or sudden death. Bezafibrate increased HDL-C by 18% and reduced triglycerides by 21%. The frequency of the primary end point was 13. 6% on bezafibrate versus 15.0% on placebo (P=0.26). After 6.2 years, the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point was 7.3%, (P=0.24). In a post hoc analysis in the subgroup with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL), the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point by bezafibrate was 39.5% (P=0.02). Total and noncardiac mortality rates were similar, and adverse events and cancer were equally distributed. Bezafibrate was safe and effective in elevating HDL-C levels and lowering triglycerides. An overall trend in a reduction of the incidence of primary end points was observed. The reduction in the primary end point in patients with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL) requires further confirmation.
Summary 1: In 3 large-scale prospective, placebo-controlled trials (the Helsinki Heart Study, a primary prevention study, and the VA-HIT and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trials, both secondary prevention studies), lowering triglycerides and raising high density lipoprotein concurrently improved outcomes. Successful dietary and medical interventions, especially with statins and fibrates, improved overall lipid profiles-not just triglyceride levels.

Query 2: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document 2: Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
Summary 2: Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

Query: What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention?
Document: In a randomized, double-blind five-year trial, we tested the efficacy of simultaneously elevating serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lowering levels of non-HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in 4081 asymptomatic middle-aged men (40 to 55 years of age) with primary dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg per deciliter [5.2 mmol per liter] in two consecutive pretreatment measurements). One group (2051 men) received 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily, and the other (2030 men) received placebo. Gemfibrozil caused a marked increase in HDL cholesterol and persistent reductions in serum levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. There were minimal changes in serum lipid levels in the placebo group. The cumulative rate of cardiac end points at five years was 27.3 per 1,000 in the gemfibrozil group and 41.4 per 1,000 in the placebo group--a reduction of 34.0 percent in the incidence of coronary heart disease (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2 to 52.6; P less than 0.02; two-tailed test). The decline in incidence in the gemfibrozil group became evident in the second year and continued throughout the study. There was no difference between the groups in the total death rate, nor did the treatment influence the cancer rates. The results are in accord with two previous trials with different pharmacologic agents and indicate that modification of lipoprotein levels with gemfibrozil reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease in men with dyslipidemia.
Summary:",Results of studies of the fibric acid derivatives are mixed. Subjects taking gemfibrozil 1200 mg per day in the 5-year Helsinki Heart Study had fewer coronary events compared with those taking a placebo (NNT = 71).

Query 1: What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy?
Document 1: Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury, especially among athletes involved in activities that include running and jumping. Often an initial period of rest from the pain-provoking activity is recommended. To prospectively evaluate if continued running and jumping during treatment with an Achilles tendon-loading strengthening program has an effect on the outcome. Randomized clinical control trial; Level of evidence, 1. Thirty-eight patients with Achilles tendinopathy were randomly allocated to 2 different treatment groups. The exercise training group (n = 19) was allowed, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, to continue Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, whereas the active rest group (n = 19) had to stop such activities during the first 6 weeks. All patients were rehabilitated according to an identical rehabilitation program. The primary outcome measures were the Swedish version of the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A-S) and the pain level during tendon-loading activity. No significant differences in the rate of improvements were found between the groups. Both groups showed, however, significant (P < .01) improvements, compared with baseline, on the primary outcome measure at all the evaluations. The exercise training group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.8) at baseline and 85 (12.7) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). The active rest group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.7) at baseline and 91 (8.2) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). No negative effects could be demonstrated from continuing Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, during treatment. Our treatment protocol for patients with Achilles tendinopathy, which gradually increases the load on the Achilles tendon and calf muscle, demonstrated significant improvements. A training regimen of continued, pain-monitored, tendon-loading physical activity might therefore represent a valuable option for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
Summary 1: During an eccentric calf-muscle training program, patients may be able to continue activity without exacerbating Achilles tendonopathy. An randomized controlled trials of 38 patients compared rest with eccentric training and continued activity and eccentric training for 12 weeks to 6 months using a pain-monitored model. Both groups showed similar improvement in pain and function when measured with the Swedish version of the Achilles assessment questionnaire (VISA-A-S 100-point scale: 0=worst function, 100=completely recovered). The baseline mean VISA-A-S scores were 57 for both groups; the mean scores after 12 months were 85 for the exercise group and 91 for the rest group.

Query: What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy?
Document: Achilles tendinitis is one of the most common of all sports injuries. There is no consensus on treatment. To assess the effectiveness of various treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults. The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2000), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2001 wk 04), CINAHL (1982 to December 2000), and reference lists of identified trials were searched. Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults. Studies focusing on pathological tendinitis were excluded. Excluded were those trials that compared different dosages of the same drug or drugs within the same class of drugs, for example different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality, by use of a ten item check list, and extracted data. Requests were sent for separate data for Achilles tendinitis patients in studies within trials of mixed patient populations. Where possible, quantitative analysis and limited pooling of data were undertaken. Nine trials, involving 697 patients, met the inclusion criteria of the review. Methodological quality was adequate in most of the trials with regards to blinding but the assessment of outcome was incomplete and short-term. There was weak but not robust evidence from three trials of a modest benefit of NSAIDs for the alleviation of acute symptoms. There was some weak evidence of no difference compared with no treatment of low dose heparin, heel pads, topical laser therapy and peritendonous steroid injection, but this could not be fully evaluated from the reports of four trials. The results of an experimental preparation of a calf-derived deproteinized haemodialysate, Actovegin, were promising but the severity of patient symptoms was questionable in the single small trial testing this comparison. The results of a comparison of glycosaminoglycan sulfate with a NSAID were inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for the treatment of acute or chronic Achilles tendinitis. Further research is warranted.
Summary:","A Cochrane review of treatments for acute Achilles tendonopathy included 9 randomized trials with a total of 697 patients. Two RCTs showed evidence that NSAIDs alleviate acute symptoms. In 1 trial of 212 patients who received an oral NSAID or placebo for 14 days, significantly fewer patients in the placebo group achieved a good or excellent symptom relief (relative risk [RR]=0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.86). A second RCT of 243 patients compared treatment with a topical NSAID to placebo for 21 days; significantly fewer participants who took placebo returned to their pre-injury level of activity (RR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). Low-dose heparin injection, heel pads, topical laser therapy, and peritendinous steroid injection produced no significant decrease in pain compared with placebo."

Query: What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy?
Document: To report the outcome of surgery for chronic recalcitrant Achilles tendinopathy in nonathletic and athletic subjects. Case-control study. University teaching hospitals. We matched each of the 61 nonathletic patients with a diagnosis of tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon with an athletic patient with tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon of the same sex and age (+/-2 years). A match was possible for 56 patients (23 males and 33 females). Forty-eight nonathletic subjects and 45 athletic subjects agreed to participate. Open surgery for Achilles tendinopathy. Outcome of surgery, return to sport, complication rate. Nonathletic patients were shorter and heavier than athletic patients. They had greater body mass index, calf circumference, side-to-side calf circumference differences, and subcutaneous body fat than athletic patients. Of the 48 nonathletic patients, 9 underwent further surgery during the study period, and only 25 reported an excellent or good result. Of the 45 athletic subjects, 4 underwent further surgery during the study period, and 36 reported an excellent or good result. The remaining patients could not return to their normal levels of activity. In all of them, pain significantly interfered with daily activities. Nonathletic subjects experience more prolonged recovery, more complications, and a greater risk of further surgery than athletic subjects with recalcitrant Achilles tendinopathy.
Summary:","Athletes responded significantly better to surgery than nonathletic patients, returning to full activity in 4.5 months compared with 7.1 months for nonathletes (P<0.03). Fewer athletes had surgical complications (9% compared with 19% of nonathletes)."

Query 1: How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient?
Document 1: In the United States, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have few or no symptoms. The need for parathyroidectomy to treat all patients with this disorder has therefore been questioned. We studied the clinical course and development of complications for periods of up to 10 years in 121 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (83 percent) of whom were asymptomatic. There were 30 men and 91 women (age range, 20 to 79 years). During the study, 61 patients (50 percent) underwent parathyroidectomy, and 60 patients were followed without surgery. Parathyroidectomy in patients with or without symptoms led to normalization of serum calcium concentrations and a mean (+/-SE) increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 8+/-2 percent after 1 year (P=0.005) and 12+/-3 percent after 10 years (P=0.03). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck increased 6+/-1 percent after 1 year (P=0.002) and 14+/-4 percent after 10 years (P=0.002). Bone mineral density of the radius did not change significantly. The 52 asymptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery had no change in serum calcium concentration, urinary calcium excretion, or bone mineral density. However, 14 of these 52 patients (27 percent) had progression of disease, defined as the development of at least one new indication for parathyroidectomy. All 20 patients with symptoms had kidney stones. None of the 12 who underwent parathyroidectomy had recurrent kidney stones, whereas 6 of the 8 patients who did not undergo surgery did have a recurrence. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy results in the normalization of biochemical values and increased bone mineral density. Most asymptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery did not have progression of disease, but approximately one quarter of them did have some progression.
Summary 1: A 10-year prospective cohort study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism found that 21% of asymptomatic patients developed decreased bone density at one or more sites. None acquired kidney stones, but hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria did worsen in 10 of 52 patients.

Query 2: What is the best workup for hypocalcemia?
Document 2: Postoperative hypocalcemia is a common and most often transient event after extensive thyroid surgery. It may reveal iatrogenic injury to the parathyroid glands and permanent hypoparathyroidism. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of hypocalcemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism following total or subtotal thyroidectomy in 1071 consecutive patients operated during 1990-1991. We then determined in a cross-sectional study which early clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients experiencing postoperative hypocalcemia correlated with the long-term outcome. Postoperative calcemia under 2 mmol/l was observed in 58 patients (5. 4%). In 40 patients hypocalcemia was considered severe (confirmed for more than 2 days, symptomatic or both). At 1 year after surgery five patients (0.5%) had persistent hypocalcemia. We found that patients carried a high risk for permanent hypoparathyroidism if fewer than three parathyroid glands were preserved in situ during surgery or the early serum parathyroid hormone level was </= 12 pg/ml, the delayed serum calcium levels </= 8 mg/dl, or the delayed serum phosphorus level >/= 4 mg/dl under oral calcium therapy. When one or more of these criteria are present, long-term follow-up should be enforced to check for chronic hypocalcemia and to avoid its severe complications by appropriate supplement therapy.
Summary 2: The usual cause of critically low serum calcium (<7 mg/dL ""corrected"" or <3.2 mg/dL ionized) is parathyroidectomy or acute renal failure. Hypocalcemia resulting from partial parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy (with inadvertent parathyroidectomy) occurs in approximately 5% of these surgeries; 99.5% of cases resolve completely within a year.

Query: How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient?
Document: Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.
Summary:","To determine the level, use the equation [4.0 - (plasma albumin)] x 0.8 + (serum calcium) or measure serum ionized calcium. Normal levels of serum ionized calcium for adults older than 19 years are 1.13 to 1.32 mmol/L, although the exact range can vary from laboratory to laboratory. Elevated physiologically active calcium indicates true hypercalcemia."

Query 2: Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures?
Document 2: Hypovitaminosis D and a low calcium intake contribute to increased parathyroid function in elderly persons. Calcium and vitamin D supplements reduce this secondary hyperparathyroidism, but whether such supplements reduce the risk of hip fractures among elderly people is not known. We studied the effects of supplementation with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and calcium on the frequency of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures, identified radiologically, in 3270 healthy ambulatory women (mean [+/- SD] age, 84 +/- 6 years). Each day for 18 months, 1634 women received tricalcium phosphate (containing 1.2 g of elemental calcium) and 20 micrograms (800 IU) of vitamin D3, and 1636 women received a double placebo. We measured serial serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 142 women and determined the femoral bone mineral density at base line and after 18 months in 56 women. Among the women who completed the 18-month study, the number of hip fractures was 43 percent lower (P = 0.043) and the total number of nonvertebral fractures was 32 percent lower (P = 0.015) among the women treated with vitamin D3 and calcium than among those who received placebo. The results of analyses according to active treatment and according to intention to treat were similar. In the vitamin D3-calcium group, the mean serum parathyroid hormone concentration had decreased by 44 percent from the base-line value at 18 months (P < 0.001) and the serum 25(OH)D concentration had increased by 162 percent over the base-line value (P < 0.001). The bone density of the proximal femur increased 2.7 percent in the vitamin D3-calcium group and decreased 4.6 percent in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium reduces the risk of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures among elderly women.
Summary 2: A randomized controlled trial of elderly ambulatory women showed that supplementation with 1200 mg calcium and 800 international units vitamin D per day for 18 months decreased hip fractures (RR=0.26; 95% CI, 0.03-0.44; NNT=48) and other nonvertebral fractures (RR=0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; NNT=26).

Query: How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient?
Document: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is the predominant cause of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. However, its prognostic utility is unclear. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of serum PTHrP levels in patients who had hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. In this prospective case series, we evaluated 76 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and hypercalcemia (serum calcium level >/=10.3 mg/dL on at least two occasions). PTHrP levels >/=1 pmol/L were considered elevated. We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with mortality. Fifty patients (66%) died during follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, higher pretreatment calcium levels and elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality, with effects of PTHrP varying by age (P = 0.03). Survival was associated with pretreatment calcium levels both in patients over 65 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] per mg/dL = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 1.8; P <0.001) and in patients aged 65 years or less (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5; P = 0.003). Adjusted for pretreatment calcium levels, elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality in patients aged </=65 years (HR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.6 to 8.8; P = 0.002), but not in older patients (HR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.9; P = 0.51). PTHrP is a useful prognostic factor in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, at least in patients aged </=65 years.
Summary:","In a prospective case series of patients with hypercalcemia and malignancy, 54% had elevated PTHrP levels. The authors found that an elevated PTHrP in patients younger than 65 years of age doubles the risk of death from malignancy compared to patients the same age with normal PTHrP (hazard ratio=1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4)."

Query 1: Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities?
Document 1: The aim, in conservative management of vesico-ureteric reflux by antimicrobial prophylaxis, is to prevent recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and consequent renal scarring. However, the effects of this prophylactic strategy are difficult to evaluate, since the required studies comparing children on prophylaxis with controls (without prophylaxis but under careful supervision) are lacking. Furthermore, the optimal length of prophylaxis needs to be defined. Since risk of renal scarring is believed to occur more frequently in young people, and since recurrent urinary infections mainly affect girls, the age and sex of subjects are important in the design of a prophylactic regimen. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are the most common agents used for long-term, low-dose antibacterial prophylaxis. Break-through infections still result from non-compliance and from development of bacterial resistance, the latter mainly arising with trimethoprim. Few studies of prophylactic drugs are available that adequately define patient materials and include a random allocation to the different agents. Further studies of the effects of alternative prophylactic agents are called for, preferably combined with fresh insight into the ecological impact on the bowel and periurethral floras.
Summary 1: No randomized controlled trials assess whether prophylaxis prevents the development of new renal scars in children.

Query 2: Is there much risk in using fluoroquinolones in children?
Document 2: The French system of drug surveillance has analysed the notifications of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to fluoroquinolones since they were launched. Their frequency ranges from 1/15,000 to 1/208,000 case per days of treatment. Cutaneous diseases and tendon disorders predominate in France whereas cutaneous effects and neuropsychiatric disorders are predominant in the UK; tendon disorders take up only the 5th position. Among the most unexpected ADRs are the following: -shock represents 33 of the anaphylaxis reactions which range from 1/5.6 x 10(6) to 1/4.4 x 10(5) case per days of treatment. -acute renal failure is rare: one case/80,000 patients treated by ciprofloxacin to 1/320,000 by norfloxacin. The pathophysiology is not well known. Tendon ruptures represent 81 cases for 921 notifications of tendon disorders which are related in decreasing order to pefloxacin 1/23,130 case per days of treatment, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin 1/779,600 case per days of treatment. Age and corticosteroids increase the risk of tendon rupture.
Summary 2: A 1996 study reported the incidence of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolones using drug surveillance data from the general population. The average age of the patients was 55 years. The author estimated the risk of tendon rupture associated with norfloxacin or ofloxacin to be 1 case per 23,130 days of treatment and only 1 case per 779,600 days of ciprofloxacin treatment. The estimated risk would likely be even lower in children, the author noted, because the risk of tendon rupture increases with age.

Query: Is there much risk in using fluoroquinolones in children?
Document: Quinolone-induced arthropathic toxicity in weight-bearing joints observed in juvenile animals during preclinical testing has largely restricted the routine use of ciprofloxacin in the pediatric age group. As histopathologic, radiologic and magnetic resonance imaging monitoring evidence has gathered supporting the safety of fluoroquinolones in children, many pediatricians have started to prescribe quinolones to some patients on a compassionate basis. The objective of this study was to ascertain the safety of ciprofloxacin in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestational age treated at Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital in Bangladesh. Long-term follow up was done to monitor the growth and development of preterm infants who were administered intravenous ciprofloxacin in the neonatal period. Ciprofloxacin was used only as a life-saving therapy in cases of sepsis produced by bacterial agents resistant to other antibiotics. Another group of preterm neonates with septicemia who were not exposed to ciprofloxacin, but effectively treated with other antibiotics and followed up, were matched with cases for gender, gestational age and birth weight and included as a comparison group. Forty-eight patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 66 patients in the comparison group were followed up for a mean of 24.7 +/- 18.5 months and 21.6 +/- 18.8 months, respectively. No osteoarticular problems or joint deformities were observed in the ciprofloxacin group during treatment or follow up. No differences in growth and development between the groups were found. Ciprofloxacin is a safe therapeutic option for newborns with sepsis produced by multiply resistant organisms.
Summary:","A prospective study published in 2006 monitored joint toxicities (swelling, tenderness, or restricted movement) during acute treatment with ciprofloxacin as well as skeletal growth at follow-up based on physical examination. Preterm neonates with septicemia were treated with either ciprofloxacin (n=48) or other antibiotics (n=66). Forty infants in the ciprofloxacin group completed an average of 28 months of follow-up. No complaints or physical findings of osteoarticular joint abnormalities or skeletal growth delay were noted in either group during acute treatment or at follow-up. The incidence of tendonopathy was not reported."

Query 1: Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor?
Document 1: This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. The use of complementary therapies is increasing and some women look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour appears safe, has no known teratogenic effects, and may be effective. The evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited. To determine the effects of acupuncture for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (February 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), PubMed (1966 to present), CISCOM (1960 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present) and bibliographies of relevant papers. Clinical trials comparing acupuncture used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. One trial of 56 women was included in the review. Data were not in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour and for trials to assess clinically meaningful outcomes.
Summary 1: A Cochrane systematic review evaluating acupuncture for inducing labor identified 1 randomized trial with methodologic flaws (allowing no conclusion), 3 case series, and 2 nonrandomized trials. The first case series used electroacupuncture at 38 to 42 weeks to successfully induce labor in 21 of 31 women. The second series, using acupuncture with and without electrical stimulation, induced labor in 10 of 12 women at 19 to 43 weeks. The third study induced labor with electroacupuncture in 78% of 41 women-34 term and postterm patients and 7 with a fetal demise. In the first nonrandomized trial, 20 of 27 women at term who received electroacupuncture gave birth between 39 weeks 3 days and 40 weeks, compared with 47 of 102 women in the control group. In the second study, 31 of 35 women who received electroacupuncture reported increased intensity of contractions compared with none of the 35 women in the control group.

Query 2: Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers?
Document 2: to study the effect of birth centre care on the duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications, and women's experiences of breast feeding. randomised controlled trial. in-hospital birth centre at South Hospital, Stockholm, and standard obstetric care in the Greater Stockholm area. 1230 women with expected date of birth between October 1989 and February 1992, interested in participating in a birth centre trial, and meeting medical low-risk criteria. 617 women were allocated to the experimental group offered birth centre care (EG), and 613 to the control group offered standard obstetric care (CG). duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications such as sore nipples, engorgement, milk stasis, and mastitis, and women's experiences of breast feeding. no difference was found between EG and CG in the duration of breast feeding. Ninety-three per cent in both groups were breast feeding exclusively two months post partum. The average number of months of breast feeding, exclusively or partly, when investigated one year after the birth was 8.6 in EG and 8.5 in CG. No difference was observed in women's experiences of breast feeding, but rather more women in EG than in CG reported sore nipples, 36% and 30% respectively (p = 0.03), and milk stasis, 26% and 19% respectively (p = 0.002). birth centre care had no effect on the duration of breast feeding, or on women's experiences of breast feeding. Prenatal attitudes were probably more significant predictors of these outcomes than differences in the two modes of maternity care in this population of highly breast feeding-motivated women. The larger proportion of sore nipples and milk stasis in the EG might have been due to earlier discharge, or to midwives less skilled in assisting with breast feeding at the birth centre than in the postpartum wards.
Summary 2: In another randomized controlled trials performed in Sweden, women who received peripartum care in a birthing center had more nipple pain than women who delivered in a traditional hospital setting (NNT=16).

Query: Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor?
Document: Breast stimulation has been suggested as a means of inducing labour. It is a non-medical intervention allowing women greater control over the induction process. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using a standardised methodology. To determine the effectiveness of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no intervention or other methods of induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (March 2004) and bibliographies of relevant papers. Clinical trials of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction. A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. Six trials (719 women) were included. Analysis of trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention found a significant reduction in the number of women not in labour at 72 hours (62.7% versus 93.6%, relative risk (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74). This result was not significant in women with an unfavourable cervix. A major reduction in the rate of postpartum haemorrhage was reported (0.7% versus 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.87). No significant difference was detected in the caesarean section rate (9% versus 10%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.12) or rates of meconium staining. There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation. Three perinatal deaths were reported (1.8% versus 0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 147.77). When comparing breast stimulation with oxytocin alone the analysis found no difference in caesarean section rates (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18). No difference was detected in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours (58.8% versus 25%, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54) or rates of meconium staining. There were four perinatal deaths (17.6% versus 5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 30.88). Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates. Until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be used in high-risk women. Further research is required to evaluate its safety, and should seek data on postpartum haemorrhage rates, number of women not in labour at 72 hours and maternal satisfaction.
Summary:","A systematic review of 6 trials with a total of 719 participants compared unilateral breast stimulation with no intervention to induce labor in women at term. In 2 trials, the 300 participants stimulated 1 breast for 1 hour a day for 3 days; in the other 4 trials, 419 women stimulated either breast alternately for 3 hours a day. Breast stimulation significantly reduced the number of women who hadn't gone into labor at 72 hours compared with nonintervention (62.7% vs 93.6%; relative risk [RR]=0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.74; number needed to treat [NNT]=3.2). This result remained significant when primiparous and multiparous women were analyzed separately, but not in the 1 trial (37 participants) that reported on women with an unfavorable cervix. Breast stimulation also reduced postpartum hemorrhage (0.7% vs 6%; RR=0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.87; NNT=18.8). None of the trials documented uterine hyperstimulation or meconium-stained fluid, and they didn't find significant differences in the rates of cesarean section (9% vs 10%; RR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.38-2.12). One trial reported 4 perinatal deaths in a high-risk population-3 in the breast stimulation group and 1 in the control group-but this finding was not replicated in any other trials."

Query 1: Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor?
Document 1: Evening primrose oil is widely used by many midwives to hasten cervical ripening in an effort to shorten labor and decrease the incidence of postdates pregnancies. Although its efficacy has been studied in the relief of symptoms of a number of medical conditions, its use has not been well studied, if at all, for the purpose of cervical ripening. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral evening primrose oil on the length of pregnancy and selected intrapartum outcomes in low-risk nulliparous women. A two group retrospective quasi-experimental design conducted on a sample of women who received care in a birth center, compared selected outcomes of 54 women taking evening primrose oil in their pregnancy with a control group of 54 women who did not. Findings suggest that the oral administration of evening primrose oil from the 37th gestational week until birth does not shorten gestation or decrease the overall length of labor. Further, the use of orally administered evening primrose oil may be associated with an increase in the incidence of prolonged rupture of membranes, oxytocin augmentation, arrest of descent, and vacuum extraction.
Summary 1: A retrospective cohort study compared pregnancy outcomes in 54 women who took evening primrose oil (500 mg 3 times a day beginning at 37 weeks) with a matched group of 54 women who did not take it. The study found no significant differences between the groups in maternal age, Apgar scores, or days of gestation. However, the women taking evening primrose oil tended to have protracted active phase of labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, arrest of descent, and oxytocin augmentation (none of which were statistically significant).

Query 2: Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor?
Document 2: The role of prostaglandins for cervical ripening and induction of labour has been examined extensively. Human semen is the biological source that is presumed to contain the highest prostaglandin concentration. The role of sexual intercourse in the initiation of labour is uncertain. The action of sexual intercourse in stimulating labour is unclear, it may in part be due to the physical stimulation of the lower uterine segment, or endogenous release of oxytocin as a result of orgasm or from the direct action of prostaglandins in semen. Furthermore nipple stimulation may be part of the process of initiation. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. To determine the effects of sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of induction. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant papers. Last searched: November 2000. (1) clinical trials comparing sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the treatment or control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4) violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect conclusions; (5) clinically meaningful outcome measures reported; (6) data available for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to materially affect the conclusion. A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involves a two-stage method of data extraction. There was one included study of 28 women which reported very limited data, from which no meaningful conclusions can be drawn. The role of sexual intercourse as a method of induction of labour is uncertain. Any future trials investigating sexual intercourse as a method of induction need to be of sufficient power to detect clinically relevant differences in standard outcomes. However, it may prove difficult to standardise sexual intercourse as an intervention to allow meaningful comparisons with other methods of induction of labour.
Summary 2: A Cochrane systematic review found 1 observational study of the effect of sexual intercourse on cervical ripening and induction of labor among 28 women at term. The study evaluated cervical Bishop scores after sexual intercourse with intravaginal semen deposition for 3 consecutive nights compared with no intercourse. The difference in Bishop score was not significant (1.0 with coitus vs 0.5 controls; P>.05) and no difference in the number of women who delivered within 3 days was noted in the 2 groups (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.45-2.20).

Query: Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor?
Document: Castor oil, a potent cathartic, is derived from the bean of the castor plant. Anecdotal reports, which date back to ancient Egypt have suggested the use of castor oil to stimulate labour. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of initiating labour in midwifery practice. Its role in the initiation of labour is poorly understood and data examining its efficacy within a clinical trial are limited. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. To determine the effects of castor oil or enemas for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of cervical ripening or induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant papers. Last searched: November 2000. (1) clinical trials comparing castor oil, bath or enemas used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the treatment or control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4) violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect conclusions; (5) clinically meaningful outcome measures reported; (6) data available for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to materially affect the conclusions. A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involves a two-stage method of data extraction. In the one included study of 100 women, which compared a single dose of castor oil versus no treatment, no difference was found between caesarean section rates (relative risk (RR) 2.31, 95% CI 0.77, 6.87). No data were presented on neonatal or maternal mortality or morbidity. There was no difference between either the rate of meconium stained liquor (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.25,2.36) or Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.02,45.71) between the two groups. The number of participants was small hence only large differences in outcomes could have been detected. All women who ingested castor oil felt nauseous. The only trial included in this review attempts to address the role of castor oil as an induction agent. The trial was small and of poor methodological quality. Further research is needed to attempt to quantify the efficacy of castor oil as an induction agent.
Summary:","A Cochrane systematic review included 1 study of women at term with intact membranes who received 1 dose of castor oil to induce labor (n=52) compared with no treatment (n=48). All women who received castor oil felt nauseous, but no other differences were noted between the castor oil group and controls in rates of cesarean section, meconium-stained fluid, or Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 minutes."

Query 1: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document 1: There has been uncertainty about whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Using standard Cochrane search methods, we identified double-blind randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment (topical, systemic or combination) had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Data extraction and analysis followed a pre-defined protocol. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain summary measures of relative risk. Six published trials were identified, of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission occurred by days 2 to 5 in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57-71) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days 2 to 5: relative risk (RR) = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11-1.55), with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days 6 to 10: RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.00-1.61). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission, and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations, generalisation of these results to a primary care-based population should be undertaken with a degree of caution.
Summary 1: The rate of spontaneous remission is much higher for adults than for children (71.6% vs 28%, respectively). The Cochrane meta-analysis reported a similar clinical cure rate in children for 6 to 10 days of treatment with topical antibiotics versus placebo. A systematic review of 5 placebo-controlled RCTs reported no serious adverse outcomes in conjunctivitis patients regardless of treatment group.

Document 2: We studied 102 children aged 1 month to 18 years in a randomized, double-blind trial designed to determine both the natural history of bacterial conjunctivitis and whether topical antibiotic therapy is beneficial. Affected eyes were treated four times a day for 7 days with drug (polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment) or placebo. Eighty-four patients had proved bacterial conjunctivitis (Haemophilus influenzae 61, Streptococcus pneumoniae 22, both one); 66 of these received only topical therapy. By 3 to 5 days, 21 of 34 (62%) patients receiving topical antibiotic were clinically cured, whereas only nine of 32 (28%) patients given placebo were cured (P less than 0.02). By 8 to 10 days, 31 (91%) of the patients given antibiotic and 23 (72%) of the placebo group were cured (P = NS). The bacterial pathogen was eradicated by day 3 to 5 in 71% and by day 8 to 10 in 79% of patients given antibiotic, compared to 19% and 31% of the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a self-limited disease, but topical antibiotic therapy with polymyxin-bacitracin shortens the duration of clinical disease and enhances eradication of the causative organism from the conjunctiva.
Summary 2: One review reports that 25% of children with Haemophilus influenzae conjunctivitis develop otitis media.

Query: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document: Conjunctivitis refers to any inflammatory condition of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the exposed surface of the sclera. It is the most common cause of ""red eye"". The etiology can usually be determined by a careful history and an ocular examination, but culture is occasionally necessary to establish the diagnosis or to guide therapy. Conjunctivitis is commonly caused by bacteria and viruses. Neisseria infection should be suspected when severe, bilateral, purulent conjunctivitis is present in a sexually active adult or in a neonate three to five days postpartum. Conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae requires aggressive antibiotic therapy, but conjunctivitis due to other bacteria is usually self-limited. Chronic conjunctivitis is usually associated with blepharitis, recurrent styes or meibomianitis. Treatment requires good eyelid hygiene and the application of topical antibiotics as determined by culture. Allergic conjunctivitis is distinguished by severe itching and allergen exposure. This condition is generally treated with topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers or anti-inflammatory agents.
Summary:","Overall, this evidence suggests that for adults, watchful waiting rather than initially treating with antibiotics is reasonable, given the self-limited nature and lack of serious outcomes in untreated patients as well as growing concern about antibiotic resistance. Note that this recommendation applies only to acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis. It is generally accepted that conjunctivitis caused by gonococcus or chlamydia should be suspected in all newborns and in severe cases in sexually active young adults. These cases warrant culturing and antibiotic treatment to prevent serious complications."

Query: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document: There are concerns regarding whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The aim of this review is to assess the benefit and harm of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. We searched the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - Central, MEDLINE and the reference lists of identified trial reports. We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the relevant studies, and we contacted investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information about additional trials. The most recent searches were carried out in September 1998. We included double masked randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic usage. One reviewer extracted data and the accuracy was checked by a second reviewer. Relative risks were summarised. We tested for heterogeneity between studies. Six published trials were identified of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial was single masked and therefore excluded. A second report, when translated, was found to have no placebo group and was therefore excluded. One trial is currently 'awaiting assessment'. This has been published in abstract form and has yet to be fully reported. All the trials thus far identified appear to have been conducted on a selected specialist care patient population. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission (cure or significant improvement) occurred by days two to five in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 57% to 71%) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days two to five: relative risk (RR) 1.31 95% CI 1.11 to 1.55, NNT=5) with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days six to 10: RR 1.27 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, NNT=5). Antibiotic treatment was associated with rates of microbiological remission (pathogen eradication or reduction). No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, indicating that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to-date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations these results may not necessarily be generalisable to a primary care based population. A trial based in primary care designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of commonly prescribed antibiotic(s) versus placebo in acute bacterial conjunctivitis is warranted.
Summary:","Although there is a small risk of complications and longer time course when bacterial conjunctivitis is left untreated, the disease is often self-limited, with a 64% clinical remission rate in patients treated for 2 to 5 days with placebo."

Query 1: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document 1: There has been uncertainty about whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Using standard Cochrane search methods, we identified double-blind randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment (topical, systemic or combination) had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Data extraction and analysis followed a pre-defined protocol. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain summary measures of relative risk. Six published trials were identified, of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission occurred by days 2 to 5 in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57-71) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days 2 to 5: relative risk (RR) = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11-1.55), with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days 6 to 10: RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.00-1.61). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission, and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations, generalisation of these results to a primary care-based population should be undertaken with a degree of caution.
Summary 1: The rate of spontaneous remission is much higher for adults than for children (71.6% vs 28%, respectively). The Cochrane meta-analysis reported a similar clinical cure rate in children for 6 to 10 days of treatment with topical antibiotics versus placebo. A systematic review of 5 placebo-controlled RCTs reported no serious adverse outcomes in conjunctivitis patients regardless of treatment group.

Query 2: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document 2: We studied 102 children aged 1 month to 18 years in a randomized, double-blind trial designed to determine both the natural history of bacterial conjunctivitis and whether topical antibiotic therapy is beneficial. Affected eyes were treated four times a day for 7 days with drug (polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment) or placebo. Eighty-four patients had proved bacterial conjunctivitis (Haemophilus influenzae 61, Streptococcus pneumoniae 22, both one); 66 of these received only topical therapy. By 3 to 5 days, 21 of 34 (62%) patients receiving topical antibiotic were clinically cured, whereas only nine of 32 (28%) patients given placebo were cured (P less than 0.02). By 8 to 10 days, 31 (91%) of the patients given antibiotic and 23 (72%) of the placebo group were cured (P = NS). The bacterial pathogen was eradicated by day 3 to 5 in 71% and by day 8 to 10 in 79% of patients given antibiotic, compared to 19% and 31% of the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a self-limited disease, but topical antibiotic therapy with polymyxin-bacitracin shortens the duration of clinical disease and enhances eradication of the causative organism from the conjunctiva.
Summary 2: One review reports that 25% of children with Haemophilus influenzae conjunctivitis develop otitis media.

Query: When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?
Document: There are concerns regarding whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The aim of this review is to assess the benefit and harm of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. We searched the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - Central, MEDLINE and the reference lists of identified trial reports. We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the relevant studies, and we contacted investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information about additional trials. The most recent searches were carried out in September 1998. We included double masked randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic usage. One reviewer extracted data and the accuracy was checked by a second reviewer. Relative risks were summarised. We tested for heterogeneity between studies. Six published trials were identified of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial was single masked and therefore excluded. A second report, when translated, was found to have no placebo group and was therefore excluded. One trial is currently 'awaiting assessment'. This has been published in abstract form and has yet to be fully reported. All the trials thus far identified appear to have been conducted on a selected specialist care patient population. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission (cure or significant improvement) occurred by days two to five in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 57% to 71%) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days two to five: relative risk (RR) 1.31 95% CI 1.11 to 1.55, NNT=5) with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days six to 10: RR 1.27 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, NNT=5). Antibiotic treatment was associated with rates of microbiological remission (pathogen eradication or reduction). No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, indicating that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to-date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations these results may not necessarily be generalisable to a primary care based population. A trial based in primary care designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of commonly prescribed antibiotic(s) versus placebo in acute bacterial conjunctivitis is warranted.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of 3 trials based in specialty clinics or hospitals reported significant clinical cure or improvement of bacterial conjunctivitis with 2 to 5 days of topical antibiotics compared with placebo (RR = 1.31, 95% CI, 1.11-1.55, number needed to treat = 5)."

Query 1: What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts?
Document 1: In an observer blind comparative study, 130 men with penile warts were randomly allocated to treatment with either cryotherapy or trichloroacetic acid (TCAA). There was no significant difference in response to treatment, side effects, or recurrence rates between the two treatments. Warts resolved in 81% of patients treated with TCAA compared with 88% of those treated with cryotherapy. Early recurrence occurred in 36% of patients treated with TCAA and in 39% of those treated with cryotherapy.
Summary 1: Cryotherapy is equivalent to trichloroacetic acid.

Query 2: What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts?
Document 2: Four hundred and fifty patients were enrolled into a randomised clinical trial in a public sexually transmitted diseases clinic to evaluate the efficacy of podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation for treatment of external genital warts. Complete clearance of warts was observed in 41%, 79%, and 94% of patients who received up to six weekly treatments of podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation, respectively. Relapses occurred in 25% of all patients, yielding 3 month clearance rates of 17%, 55%, and 71% for podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation, respectively. Wart volume and duration did not influence treatment outcome. Response to therapy was greater in women than in men, and did not differ by treatment modality. Electrodesiccation and cryotherapy were more effective than podophyllin for the treatment of external genital warts, but none of these three treatments were highly successful.
Summary 2: Cryotherapy is equivalent to electrosurgery.

Query: What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts?
Document: To evaluate and compare the efficacy and adverse effects of trichloracetic acid and cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) in the treatment of external genital warts. Eighty-six patients were enrolled into a randomized clinical trial in the Genitourinary Medicine Department of the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital (Coventry) between November 1990 and June 1991. External genital warts were treated with either trichloracetic acid or cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) on a once weekly basis. They received up to six treatments of either therapy. Complete clearance of warts in patients who received up to six treatments of cryotherapy were observed in 86% of cases and in 70% of patients who received up to six treatments of trichloracetic acid. Thirty percent of patients who were treated with trichloracetic acid developed ulcerations at the site of its application. In this study we found that cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) is more effective than that of trichloracetic acid for the treatment of external genital warts. It is also less likely to cause ulceration.
Summary:","Cryotherapy is equivalent to trichloroacetic acid. This trial showed recurrence in 22% of participants receiving electrosurgery, in 21% of those receiving cryotherapy, and in 44% of those receiving podophyllin treatment. Data are lacking on recurrence rates with imiquimod, podofilox, and intralesional interferon."

Query 1: How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia?
Document 1: Adult patients with macrocytosis, defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 femtoliters, were studied to assess the importance of an elevated MCV. After eliminating pregnant and postpartum patients and patients receiving medications known to cause macrocytosis (e.g., phenytoin, zidovudine, and chemotherapeutic agents), 80 patients were identified and studied. Sixty-seven diagnoses were made in 56 patients. These diagnoses were, in descending order: alcoholism, hematological disorders, habitual drinking, B12 deficiency, chronic liver disease, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, and reticulocytosis. While an elevated MCV is neither sensitive nor specific for any one disease state, an elevated MCV should raise suspicions of underlying pathology.
Summary 1: A prospective study of primary care patients found that reticulocytosis rarely caused macrocytosis.
##
Query 2: How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia?
Document 2: The cause of macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than or equal to 105 fl) was investigated over a period of 16 months in the 70 known cases of +/- 4000 patients seen by the Department of Internal Medicine. By means of simple laboratory investigations the cause of elevated MCV was found in more than 90% of the cases. We found vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency in 27 patients, alcohol abuse in 18, chronic persistent hepatitis in 2, hematological (pre-) malignancy in 9, hemolysis in 4, hypothyroidism in 2, and a drug effect in one patient. In 6 cases the elevated MCV could not be explained. Macrocytosis, a frequent finding that is not related to the hemoglobin concentration, is an indicator of serious pathology. The MCV level can be used to differentiate between the diagnostic categories. Only 21 patients (30%) had megaloblastic erythropoiesis that was difficult to recognize in the peripheral blood. Among the findings at routine laboratory investigations an elevated MCV may be the only indicator of vitamin deficiency, preleukemia or alcoholism.
Summary 2: A prospective study of primary care patients reported little diagnostic value for the peripheral smear.

Query: How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia?
Document: One hundred and twenty-four patients over the age of 75 years were assessed for the cause of their macrocytosis (MCV > 95 fl). A definitive diagnosis was reached in 75/124 (60%) by non-invasive techniques. The remainder underwent a bone marrow biopsy yielding a definitive diagnosis in a further six patients who had an identifiable myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A high proportion of the remainder had morphological abnormalities which fitted with no recognized pathological entity. It is suggested that these may represent MDS in evolution.

Query 1: Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients?
Document 1: Clinicians recognize the importance of monitoring aberrant medication-related behaviors of chronic pain patients while being prescribed opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) for those pain patients already on long-term opioid therapy. An initial pool of 177 items was developed with input from 26 pain management and addiction specialists. Concept mapping identified six primary concepts underlying medication misuse, which were used to develop an initial item pool. Twenty-two pain and addiction specialists rated the items on importance and relevance, resulting in selection of a 40-item alpha COMM. Final item selection was based on empirical evaluation of items with patients taking opioids for chronic, noncancer pain (N=227). One-week test-retest reliability was examined with 55 participants. All participants were administered the alpha version of the COMM, the Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) interview, and submitted a urine sample for toxicology screening. Physician ratings of patient aberrant behaviors were also obtained. Of the 40 items, 17 items appeared to adequately measure aberrant behavior, demonstrating excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Cutoff scores were examined using ROC curve analysis and reasonable sensitivity and specificity were established. To evaluate the COMM's ability to capture change in patient status, it was tested on a subset of patients (N=86) that were followed and reassessed three months later. The COMM was found to have promise as a brief, self-report measure of current aberrant drug-related behavior. Further cross-validation and replication of these preliminary results is pending.
Summary 1: The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is used to monitor aberrant behaviors in patients on opioid therapy. Scoring for the 17-item, self-administered test is similar to the SOAPP-R. In a study of 86 patients at a multidisciplinary pain center, a score of ≥9 detected opioid misuse with an LR- of 0.08 and an LR+ of 3.48, at a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 66%.

Query 2: Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 2: Concern exists that antidepressants can cause suicidality in youths with depression. To determine the pooled risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour from randomised trials of newer antidepressants. A meta-analysis was carried out to calculate odds ratios for the combined data. Self-harm or suicide-related events occurred in 71 of 1487 (4.8%) of depressed youths treated with antidepressants v. 38 of 1254 (3.0%) of those given placebo (fixed effects odds ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.13-2.54, P=0.01). There was a trend for individual suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm to occur more often in youths taking antidepressants than in those given placebo, but none of these differences was statistically significant. Antidepressants may cause a small short-term risk of self-harm or suicidal events in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder.
Summary 2: One analysis estimated the difference in risk to be 1.6-fold with a 95% CI of 1.0-2.7 (3% vs 2%; NNH=112). The lower estimated risk results largely from a statistical reframing rather than any major difference in data analyzed. The analyses used a random-effects model instead of a fixed-effects model to calculate suicidality, assuming heterogeneity in the drugs used, trial de-signs, and outcome measures. Notably, venlafaxine had the greatest - and only statistically significant - increased risk, mostly because of suicidal ideation (7 of 9 events in 182 treated patients vs none in 179 placebo patients).

Query: What common substances can cause false positives on urine screens for drugs of abuse?
Document: This manuscript reviews data available in the scientific literature relative to drug testing for the five mandated drug classes and circumstances other than abuse of the drug itself that could result in a positive test. For marijuana, passive inhalation, unknowing oral ingestion, and the use of Marinol are discussed. Data are presented on the concentration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its precursors, acid-A and acid-B, in illicit marijuana and the extent of extraction of THC in boiled (tea) or cooked products. For cocaine, passive inhalation and passive exposure issues are reviewed. For opiates, poppy seed ingestion and guidelines for exclusion of poppy seeds as a cause for a positive test are discussed. For amphetamines, issues such as the presence of other phenethylamines, l-methamphetamine (Vicks' inhalers), and other prescription drugs are discussed. Although passive inhalation of methamphetamine and phencyclidine is theoretically possible, no data were available on these issues.
Summary:","In one study, 6 volunteers in an 8x8x7-ft enclosed room were exposed to 200 mg freebase cocaine vapor; none of their urine samples exceeded the federal GC-MS threshold. In a similar study of 3 non-smokers exposed to 8 marijuana smokers (smoking 32 joints) in a 10x10x8-ft enclosed room, no samples from the nonsmokers exceeded the federal GC-MS threshold."

Query 1: What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension?
Document 1: Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown. To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002. A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years. The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.
Summary 1: Results from the largest antihypertensive clinical trial, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), were included in this meta-analysis. Although these data showed no differences between drug therapies in total and cardiovascular disease mortality, low-dose diuretics reduced certain cardiovascular endpoints (ie, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease events) more than other drug therapies.

For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.
Summary 2: The ALLHAT trial, a double-blind randomized controlled trials of 42,448 high-risk hypertensive patients aged >55 years, compared chlorthalidone (a thiazide-type diuretic) with amlodipine (Norvasc), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), or doxazosin (Cardura). In this study, which included 36% African Americans, chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine did not differ in preventing major cardiovascular events. However, lisinopril was associated with an increased risk for heart failure (relative risk [RR] for African Americans=1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.58) and stroke (RR for African Americans=1.4; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68), and amlodipine was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (RR in African Americans=1.47; 95% CI, 1.24-1.74). Additionally, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema or cough occurred more frequently among African American patients than white patients.

Query: What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension?
Document: Blood pressure reduction achieved with beta-blockers and diuretics is the best recorded intervention to date for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and death in patients with hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin II improves LVH beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death. We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and LVH ascertained by electrocardiography (ECG). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens. Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 (SD 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 508 losartan (23.8 per 1000 patient-years) and 588 atenolol patients (27.9 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98, p=0.021). 204 losartan and 234 atenolol patients died from cardiovascular disease (0.89, 0.73-1.07, p=0.206); 232 and 309, respectively, had fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.75, 0.63-0.89, p=0.001); and myocardial infarction (non-fatal and fatal) occurred in 198 and 188, respectively (1.07, 0.88-1.31, p=0.491). New-onset diabetes was less frequent with losartan. Interpretation Losartan prevents more cardiovascular morbidity and death than atenolol for a similar reduction in blood pressure and is better tolerated. Losartan seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.
Summary:","A long-term trial has compared an ARB to other types of drug therapy: losartan vs atenolol in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction (LIFE) trial. In the LIFE trial, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was less with losartan than atenolol (23.8 vs 27.9 events per 1000 patient-years, losartan and atenolol, respectively; number needed to treat=243 people-years, P=.021)."

Query 1: What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking?
Document 1: Healthcare professionals frequently advise patients to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation and to determine the effect of anti-smoking advice on disease-specific and all-cause mortality. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Date of the most recent searches: March 2004. Randomized trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomization and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up and mortality. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow up were counted as smokers. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 39 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2003, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, subjects were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics. Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) revealed a small but significant increase in the odds of quitting (odds ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 2.05). This equates to an absolute difference in the cessation rate of about 2.5%. There was insufficient evidence, from indirect comparisons, to establish a significant difference in the effectiveness of physician advice according to the intensity of the intervention, the amount of follow up provided, and whether or not various aids were used at the time of the consultation in addition to providing advice. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.67). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow-up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. It found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow up. Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Additional manoeuvres appear to have only a small effect, though more intensive interventions are marginally more effective than minimal interventions.
Summary 1: A Cochrane analysis of pooled data from 17 randomized trials that compared brief advice to no advice or usual care showed a small but significant increase in the odds of smoking cessation (odds ratio [OR]=1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-2.05). The absolute difference in cessation rate was about 2.5% (number needed to treat [NNT]=40).

Query 2: Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol?
Document 2: The aim of this study was to examine whether motivating patients to gain expertise and closely follow their risk parameters will attenuate the course of microvascular and cardiovascular sequelae of diabetes. A randomized, prospective study was conducted of 165 patients who had type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia and were referred for consultation to a diabetes clinic in an academic hospital. Patients were randomly allocated to standard consultation (SC) or to a patient participation (PP) program. Both groups were followed by their primary care physicians. The mean follow-up was 7.7 yr. The SC group attended eight annual consultations. The PP patients initiated on average one additional consultation per year. There were 80 cardiovascular events (eight deaths) in the SC group versus 47 events (five deaths) in the PP group (P = 0.001). The relative risk (RR) over 8 yr for a cardiovascular event in the intervention (PP) versus the control (SC) group was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.41). There were 17 and eight cases of stroke in the SC and PP groups, respectively (P = 0.05). RR for stroke was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.32). In the SC group, 14 patients developed overt nephropathy (four ESRD) versus seven (one ESRD) in the PP group (P = 0.05). Throughout the study period, BP, LDL cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c were significantly lower in the PP than in the SC patients. Well informed and motivated patients were more successful in obtaining and maintaining good control of their risk factors, resulting in reduced cardiovascular risk and slower progression of microvascular disease.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials (N=167) with 8 years of follow-up found that patient education and counseling effectively improved medication adherence.

Query: How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism?
Document: Primary care physicians are frequently involved in the longitudinal care of patients with alcohol problems and in helping patients to decrease their alcohol consumption. Recent clinical trials provide evidence in support of new treatment strategies for these patients. Brief interventions have been used successfully to reduce alcohol consumption in patients with hazardous and harmful drinking. Twelve-step facilitation, cognitive behavioral, and motivational enhancement therapies have produced sustained drinking reductions in patients with alcohol dependence. Pharmacologic therapies, such as naltrexone and acamprosate, have been effective in decreasing alcohol consumption when provided along with psychosocial counseling in patients with alcohol dependence. The current review highlights the application of these new therapies to primary care physicians' efforts on behalf of their patients with alcohol problems.
Summary:","When compared with placebo, disulfiram failed to significantly increase abstinence rates or decrease relapse rates or cravings."

Query 1: Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia?
Document 1: Although four meta-analytic reviews support the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for the treatment of insomnia, no meta-analysis has evaluated whether these treatment modalities yield comparable outcomes during acute treatment. The authors conducted a quantitative review of the literature on the outcome of the two treatments to compare the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy in primary insomnia. They identified studies from 1966 through 2000 using MEDLINE, psycINFO, and bibliographies. Investigations were limited to studies using prospective measures and within-subject designs to assess the efficacy of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists or behavioral treatments for primary insomnia. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists included zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon. Behavioral treatments included stimulus control and sleep restriction therapies. Twenty-one studies summarizing outcomes for 470 subjects met inclusion criteria. Weighted effect sizes for subjective measures of sleep latency, number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep quality before and after treatment were moderate to large. There were no differences in magnitude between pharmacological and behavioral treatments in any measures except latency to sleep onset. Behavior therapy resulted in a greater reduction in sleep latency than pharmacotherapy. Overall, behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy produce similar short-term treatment outcomes in primary insomnia.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of 21 studies validated behavior therapy, and revealed cognitive-behavioral treatment reduced sleep onset latency by an additional 8.8 minutes over medication (95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.04 minutes).

Query 2: Alcoholic liver disease: Is acetaminophen safe?
Document 2: Retrospective reports suggest that therapeutic doses of acetaminophen may be associated with fulminant hepatic failure and death in alcoholic patients. Millions of patients use acetaminophen; the prevalence of alcoholism in the United States is 5% to 10%. To determine if hepatic injury was associated with maximal therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen to chronic alcohol abuse patients immediately following cessation of alcohol intake (the presumed time of maximal vulnerability). Patients entering an alcohol detoxification center were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Exclusion criteria were baseline values of aspartate or alanine aminotransferase greater than 120 U/L, international normalized ratio greater than 1.5, serum acetaminophen level greater than 20 mg/L, or a history of ingesting more than 4 g/d of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, 1000 mg, or placebo was administered orally 4 times daily for 2 consecutive days and liver test results were monitored for 2 more days. Acetaminophen was not administered until the alcohol had been eliminated. There were 102 patients in the acetaminophen-treated group and 99 patients in the placebo-treated (control) group. Demographic data, alcohol history, and baseline blood test results were similar in both groups. The mean (SD) aspartate aminotransferase level on day 4 was 38.0 +/- 26.7 U/L in the acetaminophen-treated group and 37.5 +/- 27.6 U/L in the placebo-treated group. There were 4 patients in the acetaminophen-treated group and 5 in the placebo-treated group who developed an increase in their serum aspartate aminotransferase level to greater than 120 U/L; it did not exceed 200 U/L in any patient. The mean (SD) international normalized ratio on day 4 was 0.96 +/- 0.09 in the acetaminophen-treated group and 0.98 +/- 0.11 in the placebo-treated group. Repeated administration of the maximum recommended daily doses of acetaminophen to long-term alcoholic patients was not associated with evidence of liver injury.
Summary 2: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 102 alcoholic patients were given 4 g of acetaminophen daily for 2 days. Liver enzymes were monitored for an additional 2 days. There was no elevation in aminotransferases when compared with the control group of 99 patients who received the placebo. The mean aspartate transaminase level on day 4 was 38.0±26.7 U/L in the treatment group and 37.5±27.6 in the placebo group. In this brief study, there was no increase in liver toxicity among alcoholic patients given the maximal therapeutic dose of acetaminophen.

Query: How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism?
Document: The opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is reported, in single centre studies, to improve the clinical outcome of individuals with alcohol dependence participating in outpatient psychosocial programmes. This is the first multicentre controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of naltrexone as adjunctive treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse. Patients who met criteria for alcohol dependence (n = 169) or alcohol abuse (n = 6) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind oral naltrexone 50 mg daily (n = 90) or placebo (n = 85) for 12 weeks as an adjunct to psychosocial treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to first episode of heavy drinking; secondary efficacy assessments included time to first drink, alcohol consumption, craving, and changes in the serum biological markers gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Compliance was assessed by tablet counts and, in the naltrexone-treated group, by measurement of urinary concentrations of 6-ss-naltrexol. Forty-nine (58%) patients randomized to placebo and 53 (59%) randomized to naltrexone did not complete the study. In intention-to-treat analyses, there was no difference between groups on measures of drinking. The median reduction from baseline of serum GGT (P: < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale: OCDS) were greater in the naltrexone group (P: < 0.05), from approximately half-way through the study. Of 70 patients (35 placebo; 35 naltrexone) who met an a priori definition of compliance (80% tablet consumption, attendance at all follow-up appointments), those allocated to naltrexone reported consuming half the amount of alcohol (P: < 0.05), had greater median reduction in serum GGT activity (P: < 0.05), and greater reduction in alcohol craving (OCDS total score: P: < 0.05; Obsessive subscale score: P: < 0.05), compared to patients in the placebo group. Use of naltrexone raised no safety concerns. Naltrexone is effective in treating alcohol dependence/abuse in conjunction with psychosocial therapy, in patients who comply with treatment.
Summary:","When compared with placebo, nalmefene taken for 3 to 24 months significantly reduced relapse without affecting abstinence rates or cravings. Acamprosate taken for 3 to 24 months significantly increased abstinence rates, but did not significantly decrease relapse or cravings as compared with placebo."

Query 1: Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia?
Document 1: This study was conducted to test the effectiveness of an abbreviated cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (ACBT) with primary A single-blind, randomized group design was used in which study patients were randomized to either a brief, 2-session ACBT or a similarly brief intervention (SHC) that included only generic sleep hygiene recommendations. A university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. Twenty (2 women) veteran patients (M(age) = 51.0 yrs., SD = 13.7 years) who met criteria for chronic primary insomnia. Participants completed sleep logs for 2 weeks and questionnaires to measures insomnia symptoms, sleep-related self-efficacy, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep before treatment, during a 2-week posttreatment assessment, and again at a 3-month posttreatment follow-up. Statistical analyses showed that ACBT produced significantly larger improvements across a majority of outcome measures than did SHC. Case-by-case analyses showed that only the ACBT produced consistent positive effects across study patients, and a sizeable proportion of these patients receiving this treatment achieved clinically significant improvements by their study endpoints. Approximately 52% of those receiving the ACBT reported at least a 50% reduction in their wake time after sleep onset, and 55.6% of ACBT-treated patients who entered the study with pathologic scores on an Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ), achieved normal ISQ scores by their final outcome assessment. ACBT is effective for reducing subjective sleep disturbance and insomnia symptoms in primary care patients.
Summary 1: Researchers conducting a single-blind randomized group study in a Veterans Affairs primary care clinic concluded that an abbreviated cognitive-behavioral treatment approach with two 25-minute sessions effectively improved participant sleep onset latency, and time awake after sleep onset. Researchers reviewed participants' sleep logs and a behavioral health provider offered patients a condensed education on sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and sleep restrictions strategies. The study was limited because of small sample size (<25). Generalizability to practice is restricted because sessions were conducted by a behavioral health provider, not a family physician.

Query: How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism?
Document: To describe a preliminary investigation of a model of naltrexone therapy and counselling for use by primary care providers and evaluate its impact on drinking behaviors in a cohort of alcohol-dependent subjects. The subjects enrolled in this study were 29 alcohol-dependent individuals. They were managed within a primary care treatment model located at a university-affiliated substance research program in New Haven, Connecticut. Subjects were assigned to a primary care provider for treatment of their alcohol dependence and were placed on naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg per day. They were seen for an initial ""new patient"" visit and 7 ""brief"" follow-up visits during the 10-week study. The primary outcomes for this study were completion of treatment, change in drinking behaviors from baseline, change in liver enzymes from baseline, provider ratings of improvement, and patient ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment. Of the 29 subjects: 21 (72%) completed treatment, and 10 (35%) relapsed to heavy drinking. All drinking behaviors improved significantly from baseline: percent of days abstinent increased from 36.6% to 88.8% (P < 0.0001), percent days abstinent from heavy drinking increased from 48.7% to 97.3% (P < 0.0001), and mean number of drinks per occasion decreased from 9.5 to 2.5 (P < 0.0001). The mean serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) for the group decreased from 67.1 U/L to 45.3 U/L (P < 0.0001). In this preliminary investigation, treatment of alcohol dependence with our model of naltrexone and counselling by primary care providers appeared to be both feasible and effective.

Query 1: How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old?
Document 1: Children found to be anemic on routine screening by HemoCue, a rapid and relatively inexpensive method of screening for hemoglobin (Hb), are often prescribed iron as a diagnostic tool and potential treatment for presumed iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We questioned this approach given the declining prevalence of IDA and the concomitant relative increase in other causes of anemia. To evaluate the practice of Hb screening for IDA by determining the prevalence of anemia by HemoCue; the proportion of anemic patients treated with iron and followed up; the frequency of repeated Hb testing, additional iron studies, and iron prescriptions; and the 6-month outcomes of treated and untreated anemia. Retrospective cohort study. Of 1358 children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia, defined as a Hb level of less than 110 g/L. Outpatient medical records of 334 of the anemic children revealed that 239 (72%) were prescribed iron while 95 (28%) were not prescribed iron at the first visit for anemia. Anemia follow-up rates were low for the prescribed and not prescribed groups: 7% vs 5% returned within 1 month, while 37% vs 42% did not return within 6 months for follow-up. Of the children who were prescribed iron, 107 (71%) of 150 responded to treatment or anemia resolved within 6 months compared with 27 (68%) of 40 not prescribed iron. Children underwent repeated blood testing for measurement of Hb and complete blood cell count, but underwent few iron-specific studies. Routine screening for IDA by HemoCue followed by a therapeutic trial of iron was problematic because of a high rate of anemia in this predominantly African American population, low follow-up rates, and a high spontaneous resolution rate. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate other screening methods to differentiate IDA from other forms of anemia and to improve compliance and outcome in inner-city children.
Summary 1: In a retrospective cohort study of 1358 innercity children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia (Hgb <11 g/dL); of these, 239 (72%) were prescribed iron and 95 (28%) were not. Responders were defined as those with a hemoglobin value of greater than 11 g/dL or an increase of 1 g/dL documented within 6 months of the initial screening visit. Follow-up rates for both groups were low (~50%), but of those prescribed iron, 107 of 150 (71%) responded to treatment compared with 27 of 48 (68%) of those who did not receive iron. Since similar response rates were seen among infants who did and infants who did not receive iron therapy, proving the benefit of routine screening followed by a trial of iron may be problematic in populations with higher rates of anemia, low follow-up rates, and high spontaneous resolution rates.

Document 2: An evaluation was made of 278 healthy-appearing 1-year-old infants who were tested for iron deficiency to determine the relative frequency of adverse side effects attributable to oral iron treatment. After obtaining parental informed consent, laboratory tests of iron status were performed on venous blood and infants with hemoglobin level greater than 10.5 g/dL were randomly chosen to receive 1.2 mL of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) drops (about 3 mg of iron per kilogram per day) or equal volume of placebo for 3 months. After 3 months of treatment, infants were to return to the clinic for repeat blood testing, compliance estimation, and evaluation for possible adverse side effects. There was no significant difference (P greater than .50) in the frequency of vomiting, diarrhea, or fussiness in iron-treated infants (6%) compared with placebo-treated infants (9%). Constipation was slightly more frequently reported (P = .03) in placebo-treated infants (9%) than in iron-treated infants (1%). Compliance with therapy was confirmed in 179 completely evaluated infants by the lack of remaining medication at 3 months, the higher incidence (P less than .0001) of dark stools reported among iron-treated infants, and the changes in laboratory tests of iron status. No parents reported dark stools as an adverse effect of therapy. It is concluded that once daily, moderate-dose FeSO4 therapy given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy.
Summary 2: A randomized controlled trial of iron supplementation vs placebo in 278 infants testing positive for iron-deficiency anemia demonstrated that once daily, moderate-dose ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) therapy (3 mg/kg/d of elemental iron) given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy.

Query: How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old?
Document: Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are common in young children. It has been suggested that the lack of iron may have important effects on children's psychomotor development and cognitive function. To determine the effects of iron therapy on psychomotor development and cognitive function in iron deficient children less than 3 years of age. The following databases were searched: COCHRANE LIBRARY (2000 ISSUE 4) MEDLINE (1966-August 2000) EMBASE (1980-August 2000) Latin American Database (LILACS) PsycLIT Journal articles (1974-August 2000) PsycLIT Chapters and Books (1987-August 2000) The references of identified trials and of important review articles were scrutinised. Citation searches on trials from the primary search were performed within the Science Citation Index. Key authors were contacted. Studies were included if children less than 3 years of age with evidence of iron deficiency anaemia were randomly allocated to iron or iron and vitamin C versus a placebo or vitamin C alone and assessment of developmental status or cognitive function was carried out using standardised tests by observers blind to treatment allocation. Abstracts and titles of studies identified on searches of electronic databases were read to determine whether they might meet the inclusion criteria. Full copies of those possibly meeting these criteria from electronic or other searches were assessed by two independent reviewers. Differences of opinion about suitability for inclusion were resolved by discussion. Data were analysed separately depending on whether participants had iron assessments were performed within one month of beginning iron therapy or later. Five trials, including 180 children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development between 5 and 11 days of commencement of therapy. Data from four trials could be pooled. The pooled difference in pre to post treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron treated and placebo groups was -3.2 (95%CI -7.24, 0.85) and in Bayley Scale MDI, 0.55 (95% CI -2.84, 1.75). Two studies, including 160 randomised children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development more than 30 days after commencement of therapy. Aukett et al reported the mean number of skills gained after two months of iron therapy, using the Denver test. The intervention group gained 0.8 (95% CI -0.18, 1.78) more skills on average than the control group. Idjrandinata et al reported that the difference in pre to post treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron treated and placebo groups after 4 months was 18.40 (95%CI 10.16, 26.64) and in Bayley Scale MDI, 18.80 (95% CI 10.19, 27.41). There is no convincing evidence that iron treatment of young children with IDA has an effect on psychomotor development discernable within 5-11 days. The effect of longer term treatment remains unclear but the data would be compatible with clinically significant benefit. There is urgent need for further randomised controlled trials with long term follow up.
Summary:","A recent Cochrane review suggests there is a clinically significant benefit for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia; however, there is a need for further randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up."

Compliance with therapy was confirmed in 179 completely evaluated infants by the lack of remaining medication at 3 months, the higher incidence (P less than .0001) of dark stools reported among iron-treated infants, and the changes in laboratory tests of iron status. No parents reported dark stools as an adverse effect of therapy. It is concluded that once daily, moderate-dose FeSO4 therapy given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy.
Summary 1: A randomized controlled trial of iron supplementation vs placebo in 278 infants testing positive for iron-deficiency anemia demonstrated that once daily, moderate-dose ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) therapy (3 mg/kg/d of elemental iron) given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy.

Query 2: How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old?
Document 2: Children found to be anemic on routine screening by HemoCue, a rapid and relatively inexpensive method of screening for hemoglobin (Hb), are often prescribed iron as a diagnostic tool and potential treatment for presumed iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We questioned this approach given the declining prevalence of IDA and the concomitant relative increase in other causes of anemia. To evaluate the practice of Hb screening for IDA by determining the prevalence of anemia by HemoCue; the proportion of anemic patients treated with iron and followed up; the frequency of repeated Hb testing, additional iron studies, and iron prescriptions; and the 6-month outcomes of treated and untreated anemia. Retrospective cohort study. Of 1358 children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia, defined as a Hb level of less than 110 g/L. Outpatient medical records of 334 of the anemic children revealed that 239 (72%) were prescribed iron while 95 (28%) were not prescribed iron at the first visit for anemia. Anemia follow-up rates were low for the prescribed and not prescribed groups: 7% vs 5% returned within 1 month, while 37% vs 42% did not return within 6 months for follow-up. Of the children who were prescribed iron, 107 (71%) of 150 responded to treatment or anemia resolved within 6 months compared with 27 (68%) of 40 not prescribed iron. Children underwent repeated blood testing for measurement of Hb and complete blood cell count, but underwent few iron-specific studies. Routine screening for IDA by HemoCue followed by a therapeutic trial of iron was problematic because of a high rate of anemia in this predominantly African American population, low follow-up rates, and a high spontaneous resolution rate. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate other screening methods to differentiate IDA from other forms of anemia and to improve compliance and outcome in inner-city children.
Summary 2: In a retrospective cohort study of 1358 innercity children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia (Hgb <11 g/dL); of these, 239 (72%) were prescribed iron and 95 (28%) were not. Responders were defined as those with a hemoglobin value of greater than 11 g/dL or an increase of 1 g/dL documented within 6 months of the initial screening visit. Follow-up rates for both groups were low (~50%), but of those prescribed iron, 107 of 150 (71%) responded to treatment compared with 27 of 48 (68%) of those who did not receive iron. Since similar response rates were seen among infants who did and infants who did not receive iron therapy, proving the benefit of routine screening followed by a trial of iron may be problematic in populations with higher rates of anemia, low follow-up rates, and high spontaneous resolution rates.

Query: How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old?
Document: This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of laboratory tests for iron deficiency (mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin) in predicting hemoglobin response to iron therapy in infants found to have low Hgb concentrations. Screening for anemia was performed on capillary blood of 1,128 healthy 1-year-old infants of United States Air Force personnel. The 25% who had Hgb values less than 11.5 gm/dl were asked to return for tests on venous blood before therapy and again after three months of therapy. Of the 188 infants completing therapy, 66 (35%) had a rise in Hgb concentration greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl and were designated responders. None of the confirmatory tests on venous blood reliably distinguished responders from those who subsequently showed no response. By using any one of the tests in combination with a capillary Hgb value less than 11.5 gm/dl, more than half of the infants with an abnormal value responded. But well over half of the responders would have been missed if treatment had been restricted to infants with abnormal values. Neither changes in the criteria for normality nor combinations of tests substantially improved our ability to distinguish the two groups. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing responders from nonresponders with additional laboratory tests and because of the simplicity, low cost, and relative safety of iron therapy in infants, we favor an initial therapeutic trial of iron first for determining the cause of low Hgb values in similar high-risk populations. Further costly workup can then be reserved for the small number of infants who still have unexplained Hgb concentrations less than 11.0 gm/dl after a therapeutic trial.
Summary:","A prospective study of 1128 children identified as anemic with a screening hemoglobin level showed that subsequent testing-which included mean corpuscular volume, protoporphyrin, transferrin, and ferritin measurements-did not reliably distinguish potential responders from nonresponders to a 3-month trial of empiric iron therapy. In fact, more than half of the responders would have been missed if treatment had been restricted to infants with abnormal mean corpuscular volume or iron studies. Because of the simplicity, low cost, and relative safety of iron therapy for infants, this trial suggests that a therapeutic trial of iron be given first, reserving further work-up for the small number of infants that still have unexplained hemoglobin concentrations of <11.0 g/dL after a therapeutic trial."

Document 1: An evaluation was made of 278 healthy-appearing 1-year-old infants who were tested for iron deficiency to determine the relative frequency of adverse side effects attributable to oral iron treatment. After obtaining parental informed consent, laboratory tests of iron status were performed on venous blood and infants with hemoglobin level greater than 10.5 g/dL were randomly chosen to receive 1.2 mL of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) drops (about 3 mg of iron per kilogram per day) or equal volume of placebo for 3 months. After 3 months of treatment, infants were to return to the clinic for repeat blood testing, compliance estimation, and evaluation for possible adverse side effects. There was no significant difference (P greater than .50) in the frequency of vomiting, diarrhea, or fussiness in iron-treated infants (6%) compared with placebo-treated infants (9%). Constipation was slightly more frequently reported (P = .03) in placebo-treated infants (9%) than in iron-treated infants (1%).

Document: The purpose of this study was to determine the Hgb response to a therapeutic trial of iron in infants with anemia compared to those with low-normal hemoglobin values. Hgb was determined in 1.128 one-year-old infants. The 278 infants (25%) who had an Hgb less than 11.5 gm/dl were given a three-month oral course of ferrous sulfate (3 mg iron/kg/day); the regimen was satisfactorily completed by 188 infants. Of the 75 infants whose initial capillary Hgb was in the anemic range (Hgb less than 11.0 gm/dl), 45% had an increase in venous Hgb greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl. Of the 113 infants with initial capillary values in the low-normal range (11.0 to 11.4 gm/dl), 28% had greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl Hgb response. Despite the lower rate of response in the low-normal group, almost half of the infants with a greater than or equal to 1 gm/dl response would have been missed by using the generally accepted cutoff value of 11 gm/dl for a therapeutic trial. Because of the low cost and simplicity of a therapeutic trial, we favor including the low-normal Hgb group for a therapeutic trial of iron in order to avoid missing iron-responsive individuals among groups of infants with a similarly high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia.
Summary:",Similar results were found in a trial of empiric iron therapy among infants with anemia.

Query 1: Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity?
Document 1: The aim of prescribing strict bed rest for acute deep venous thrombosis is to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism and pain in the legs, as well as swelling. This study was performed in order to compare outcome of mobilization against 5 days of strict bed rest in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 103 in-patients with proximal DVT or patients admitted to the hospital because of proximal DVT were recruited to a randomized study. All patients were treated in hospital and given a lower leg and thigh compression bandage as well as therapeutic doses of the low molecular weight heparin, dalteparin-sodium (Fragmin). Seven of 52 patients (13.5%) in the mobile group versus 14 of 50 patients (28.0%) in the immobile group suffered at least one of the outcomes defined under the combined primary endpoint (clinically relevant pulmonary embolisms, pulmonary embolisms detectable by scintigraphy or computer tomography, progression of thrombosis or new thrombosis, nosocomial infections and/or serious adverse events) (p = 0.088), whereby serious adverse events occurred once in the mobile group and three times in the immobile group. New pulmonary embolisms over the course were seen in 10 of 50 patients (20%) with a perfusion disorder at baseline scintigraphy, while such was ascertained only in one of 52 patients (1.9%) without a perfusion disorder at baseline scintigraphy. Leg pain was reduced from 54.1 (+/-30.4) to 20.7 (+/-19.2) in the mobilized group and from 41.0 (+/-26.8) to 14.0 (+/-11.1) in the immobilized patients. Leg pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). More immobilized patients complained of increasing back pain (23% versus 6%) and disturbed micturition (10% versus 2%) as well as defecation (13% versus 6%) on day 5. More patients in the mobile group reported increased stress from the thrombosis and its treatment (15% versus 6%). No benefit of prescribing bed rest in patients with deep venous thrombosis could be detected in this study. Based on data available, strict bed rest for at least 5 days is not justified if adequate therapy with low molecular weight heparin and adequate compression is assured. It remains open whether patients with initial signs of pulmonary embolism might profit from a brief immobilization.
Summary 1: An randomized controlled trials revealed a trend toward thrombus progression occurring more often in patients who were treated with bed rest compared with patients treated with ambulation and compression, though the difference did not reach statistical significance because of small sample size. The clinical importance of these phlebographic studies is not clear.

Query 2: Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip?
Document 2: Deep-vein thrombosis is a well-recognized complication after trauma to the legs and subsequent immobilization, but there are no generally accepted approaches to preventing this complication. We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous reviparin (1750 anti-Xa units given once daily) in 440 patients who required immobilization in a plaster cast or brace for at least five weeks after a leg fracture or rupture of the Achilles tendon. The study drug was given throughout the period of immobilization. Venography of the injured leg was performed within one week after removal of the plaster cast or brace, or earlier if there were symptoms suggesting deep-vein thrombosis. Data on efficacy and end points were available for 371 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 17 of the 183 patients randomly assigned to receive reviparin (9 percent) and in 35 of the 188 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo (19 percent) (odds ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.82). Most of the thromboses were distal (14 in the reviparin group and 25 in the placebo group). There were two cases of pulmonary embolism, both in patients in the placebo group who also had proximal deep-vein thrombosis. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding or other adverse events. Deep-vein thrombosis is common in persons with leg injury requiring prolonged immobilization. Reviparin given once daily appears to be effective and safe in reducing the risk of this complication.
Summary 2: An randomized controlled trials evaluated reviparin (another European LMWH) vs placebo in 440 outpatients with lower limb injuries, of whom 293 had fractures. About half had surgical management and all were treated with a plaster cast or brace for an average of 44 days. Most were ambulatory with crutches. All underwent venography within a week of cast removal. The deep venous thrombosis rate for fracture patients using reviparin was 10.4%, vs 18.2% among those without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis (absolute risk reduction=7.8%; NNT=12.8). Three fourths of the DVTs were in distal veins, and 21% of the DVTs in the low-molecular-weight heparin patients occurred in deep veins compared with 34% in patients without. Two pulmonary emboli occurred, both in patients without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis.

Query: Should patients with acute DVT limit activity?
Document: Traditionally, many patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are treated not only by anticoagulation therapy but additionally by strict bed rest, which is aimed at reducing the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) events. However, this risk has not been subjected to empirical verification. The Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbólica is a Spanish registry of consecutively enrolled patients with objectively confirmed, symptomatic acute DVT or PE. In this analysis, the clinical characteristics, details of anticoagulant therapy, and clinical outcomes of enrolled patients with and without strict bed rest prescribed during the first 15 days were compared. Patients in whom ambulation was not possible were not included in this analysis. A total of 2,650 patients entered the study (DVT, 2,038 patients; PE, 612 patients). Of these patients, 1,050 DVT patients (52%) and 385 PE patients (63%) were prescribed strict bed rest. New events of symptomatic, objectively confirmed PE developed during the 15-day study period in 11 patients with DVT (0.5%) and 4 patients with PE (0.7%). Five of these 15 patients (33%) died as a result of their PE. Age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 11) and cancer (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.98 to 9.1) were associated with an increased rate of new PEs. There were not significant differences between bedridden and ambulant patients in terms of new PE events, fatal PE, or bleeding complications. Our findings confirm those from previous reports suggesting that bed rest has no influence on the risk of developing PE among patients with acute DVT of the lower limbs. In addition, our findings show for the first time the lack of influence of bed rest even in patients presenting with acute submassive PE.
Summary:","A study using the RIETE registry, a Spanish registry of consecutively enrolled patients with objectively confirmed acute DVT or PE, found no significant difference in occurrence of new PE between immobilized and mobilized patients. Patients with DVT who were immobilized were generally sicker, more likely to have PaO2 <60, and more likely to have received lower doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) compared with the group that walked (P<.005)."

Document 2: To investigate the effect of compression and immediate ambulation in the acute stage of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the development of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Design: follow-up study of patients who previously have been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Setting: outpatient department of a municipial hospital. Subjects and interventions: a follow-up was performed 2 years after 53 patients with acute proximal DVT had been enrolled into a randomized controlled trial, comparing bed rest and no compression (n=17), Unna boot bandages plus walking (n=18) and compression stockings plus walking (n=18). Telephone interviews could be conducted with 11 patients, 37 patients could be reinvestigated by independent observers (11 from the bed-rest group, 13 from the bandage group and 13 from the stocking group). Compression stockings up to the time of the follow-up were worn by 8/11 (73%) of the bed-rest patients and by 13/26 (50%) of the mobile patients. Main outcome measures: clinical and venous duplex investigation, pain assessment using visual analogue scale and Lowenberg test, leg circumference, clinical ''PTS-score'' combining 5 subjective symptoms with 6 objective signs (Villalta-Prandoni-scale). Duplex investigation of the deep veins and pain assessment by visual analogue scale showed no significant differences between the groups. Nine out of 11 patients after bed rest, but only 16/26 in the mobile groups showed a larger calf circumference on the diseased leg (n.s.). Judged by the Villalta-Prandoni-scale a significantly better outcome could be found in the mobile group (mean score 5.1) than in the bed-rest group (mean score 8.2), (p<0.01). (''Mild PTS'' = score 5-14, ''severe PTS'' score = or > 15). Eighteen out of 26 mobile patients, but only 2/11 bed-rest patients had a score = or < 5 (''no PTS''). Immediate mobilisation with compression in the acute stage of DVT reduces the incidence and the severity of PTS.

Query: Should patients with acute DVT limit activity?
Document: To elucidate the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who are kept walking with compression bandages. Perfusion/ventilation scanning of the lungs was performed at admission and after 10 days of treatment. General community hospital. A total of 631 consecutive patients were studied (upper limit of the thrombi: iliofemoral vein, n=212; femoral or popliteal vein, n=302; lower leg, n=117). The patients received different dose regimens of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) subcutaneously. The study revealed that the prevalence of PE at baseline was between 45.1% and 51% (95% CI 38.2-55.2 and 45.2-56.8% respectively) in patients with proximal DVT, and 31.9% (95% CI 23.6-41.2%) in those with DVT restricted to the lower leg. The majority of these cases of PE were completely asymptomatic. The incidence of a new PE, revealed by a second lung scan on day 10 after admission, was 7.0% (95% CI 3.9-11.4%) in patients with iliofemoral DVT, 5.5% (95% CI 3.2-8.7%) in those with femoropopliteal DVT and 2.7% (95% CI 0.6-7.6%) in those with lower-leg DVT. These incidence rates for new PEs were significantly lower than the rates previously reported (p<0.01). The fatality rate was also lower compared with the literature: one patient suffered a fatal PE (0.2%; 95% CI 0-0.9%), four patients died from malignant tumours, and one from pneumonia. The frequency of malignant tumours was greater in this study than in the literature (23% in patients with iliofemoral DVT, 14% in those with femoropopliteal DVT and 9% in those with DVT of the lower leg). Mobile patients with DVT do not need bed-rest. Low-molecular-weight heparin s.c., compression bandages and walking exercises make home-treatment of DVT feasible.
Summary:",A cohort study in which 691 patients were kept walking with compression therapy reported a mortality rate of 0.2%.

Document: The PHLECO Study (phlebothrombosis conservative therapy) is a multicenter investigation of patients with deep vein thrombosis receiving conservative nonfibrinolytic hospital treatment. A second study (part II: PHLEFI, phlebothrombosis fibrinolytic treatment) to be published later deals with the outcome of fibrinolytic therapy. In both studies the incidence of life-threatening sequelae, such as pulmonary embolism, is of major interest. The 49 medical departments participating in the study mailed the relevant data to the Duisburg Coordination Center for further data analysis and the following information was gained: (a) In descending order of frequency, the clinical conditions of thrombosis were: immobility, postoperative status, malignancy, hormone treatment, posttraumatic conditions, and pregnancy. (b) In descending order of frequency, the sites of thrombosis were: femoral vein, calf vein, iliac vein, popliteal vein, and subclavian vein. Left-sided thrombosis predominated in the iliac and subclavian vein groups. (c) In descending order of frequency, the treatment regimens employed were: intravenous heparin+oral anticoagulants, intravenous heparin+subcutaneous heparin, intravenous heparin alone, subcutaneous heparin alone, intravenous heparin+subcutaneous heparin+oral anticoagulants, subcutaneous heparin+oral anticoagulants, intravenous heparin+platelet aggregation inhibitors. (d) The average hospital stay was 23.7 +/- 15.6 days. No correlation existed between duration of hospital stay and particular types of therapy. (e) The incidence of nonfatal pulmonary embolism was 16.1% while that of fatal pulmonary embolism was 2.33%. (f) Women outnumbered men in the group with fatal pulmonary embolism, and the death rate among older patients was higher than that among younger patients. (g) Patients with fatal pulmonary embolism had a shorter history of thrombosis than patients in the unselected cohort (patients with and without pulmonary embolism).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Summary:","A retrospective, multicenter cohort of 1647 patients treated with unfractionated heparin and bed rest in different German hospitals reported a rate of fatal PE of 2.33%."

Query 1: How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety?
Document 1: Outcome of anxiety disorder treatment with psychotherapy and medication is generally as good as or better than that of other psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, refractory cases occur. The first step in approaching the treatment-resistant patient with an anxiety disorder is to be certain that the treatment has been adequate. Failure to provide an adequate dose of medication for adequate periods of time may be the most common cause of ""treatment resistance."" The second step is to reconsider the diagnosis and/or determine if new diagnoses have emerged since the original consultation. Depression and substance abuse are especially likely to complicate anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown that concomitant personality disorders (axis II) increase the occurrence of resistance to standard treatment and must be addressed through psychotherapy. Last, a variety of possible underlying medical conditions, including thyroid disorder, arrhythmia, and complex partial seizure, should be considered. Then, the clinician should consider a variety of pharmacologic approaches that are specific to each anxiety disorder. Panic disorder patients who are refractory to imipramine frequently respond to high-potency benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or various combinations. Generalized anxiety disorder, if unresponsive to benzodiazepines, may respond to buspirone or a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who have failed to respond to clomipramine or fluoxetine and other serotonin reuptake blockers may benefit from augmentation strategies using combination therapies including buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fluoxetine, or alprazolam.
Summary 1: A review of 13 controlled clinical trials evaluated standardized depression and anxiety score reductions for patients with generalized anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy compared with various control treatments (waiting list, pill placebo, or alternative therapy-such as supportive listening psychotherapy). Approximately half of the patients were also taking medication (not specified). After an average of 10 sessions, cognitive behavioral therapy reduced anxiety and depression symptom scores more than control treatments (difference in effect size were 0.71 and 0.66, respectively). At 6- to 12-month follow-up, cognitive behavioral therapy gains were maintained (difference in effect size=0.30 for anxiety scores and 0.21 for depression scores). (An effect size of 0.2 is usually considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 is large.)

Query 2: How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI?
Document 2: More than half of anxiety and depression patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve. We retrospectively examined whether treatment-resistant depression and anxiety disorder patients responded to and tolerated augmentation with the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole. We report on patients with depression and anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had an incomplete response to a variety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and who received augmentation with aripiprazole. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean+/-SD CGI-S was 3.8+/-1.3 at endpoint. Fifty-nine percent of subjects received CGI-I ratings of 1 or 2, 'much improved' or 'very much improved,' in terms of their depression and anxiety symptoms at the end of 12 weeks. Several patients showed an early (weeks 1-5), as well as sustained, response to augmentation with doses of aripiprazole between 15 and 30 mg/day. The results suggest that aripiprazole may be effective as an augmentation for patients with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders despite initial SSRI treatment. Because this is a retrospective case review, further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.
Summary 2: A cohort study of augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic agent such as aripiprazole (Abilify) suggest improved outcomes, but similar studies found no benefit.

Query: How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety?
Document: Severity of anxiety does not appear to influence the antidepressant response to fluoxetine during acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We report a retrospective pooled analysis of 2 studies to assess the effect of associated anxiety on the efficacy of fluoxetine in the continuation treatment phase of MDD. Patients whose MDD remitted (study 1) or responded (study 2) after approximately 12 to 13 weeks of open-label treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to placebo, continued treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily, or, in study 2 only, treatment with enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly, for at least 25 weeks. Both studies included male and female outpatients who met criteria for MDD as assessed by DSM-III-R (study 1) or DSM-IV (study 2). Patients were categorized into high anxiety (> or = 7) or low anxiety (< 7) subgroups based on baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) anxiety/somatization subfactor scores. Subgroups were compared by therapy for time from randomization to relapse and change in efficacy scores. No significant differences in time to relapse were observed between anxiety subgroups in either active treatment group. However, in patients switched to placebo for continuation treatment, the high anxiety subgroup had a significantly higher risk of relapse than those with low anxiety (risk ratio = 1.63, p =.013). Significant differences between anxiety groups were seen in change in HAM-D anxiety/somatization subfactor scores in the fluoxetine 20 mg and placebo treatment groups, and in change in HAM-D-17 scores in the placebo treatment group (p <.05). Although high baseline anxiety does not appear to impact the benefit of continuation therapy with fluoxetine, it does appear to predict increased risk of relapse in individuals who do not remain on antidepressant therapy for the duration of continuation treatment.
Summary:",Patients with major depression and high anxiety levels relapsed more often than those with low anxiety levels with discontinuation of fluoxetine compared with placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial with 596 patients.

Query 1: What other STI testing should we do for a patient with chlamydia?
Document 1: A cross-sectional study of new clients with either gonorrhoea or chlamydia attending King's College Hospital in 1998. One thousand two hundred and thirty-nine women and 1141 men had gonorrhoea, chlamydia or both. Overall, 24.2% (124/512) of heterosexual men and 38.5% (136/353) of women with gonorrhoea also had chlamydia (P<0.001). Of heterosexual males 18.8% (124/660) and 13% (136/1022) of females with chlamydia also had gonorrhoea (P=0.002). Ethnicity had no effect on the proportion of co-infection after controlling for age and gender. Clients with dual infection were younger than those with either infection alone (P=0.0001). Over half of women and a quarter of men aged 15 to 19 years were dually infected so testing for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia may be appropriate in this age group in settings outside genitourinary clinics. The high proportion of cases of gonorrhoea that also have chlamydia justifies the policy of epidemiological treatment for chlamydia.
Summary 1: The high prevalence of coinfection of chlamydia and gonorrhea has been shown in several studies. One cross-sectional study of new clients to a hospital-based STI clinic with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both infections found 39% of 1239 women and 24% of 1141 heterosexual men with gonorrhea also had chlamydia. Thirteen percent of females and 19% of heterosexual males with chlamydia also had gonorrhea. More than half of the women and a third of the men aged 15 to 19 had both gonorrhea and chlamydia. Patients with both STIs tended to be younger than those with one.

Query 2: What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions?
Document 2: These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on September 26-28, 2000. The information in this report updates the 1998 Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (MMWR 1998;47 [No. RR-1]). Included in these updated guidelines are new alternative regimens for scabies, bacterial vaginosis, early syphilis, and granuloma inguinale; an expanded section on the diagnosis of genital herpes (including type-specific serologic tests); new recommendations for treatment of recurrent genital herpes among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); a revised approach to the management of victims of sexual assault; expanded regimens for the treatment of urethral meatal warts; and inclusion of hepatitis C as a sexually transmitted infection. In addition, these guidelines emphasize education and counseling for persons infected with human papillomavirus, clarify the diagnostic evaluation of congenital syphilis, and present information regarding the emergence of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and implications for treatment. Recommendations also are provided for vaccine-preventable STDs, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
Summary 2: Serologic tests are often used to detect herpes simplex virus because they can differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2. There is an FDA-approved point-of-care test called POCkit that gives results from capillary blood or serum during an office visit. These tests are 80% to 98% sensitive and more than 96% specific. Unfortunately, they are not readily available in all countries.

Query: What other STI testing should we do for a patient with chlamydia?
Document: Juvenile detention centers offer public health practitioners an opportunity to gain access to large numbers of adolescents at risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea. To describe the prevalence and coinfection of chlamydia and gonorrhea among adolescents in 14 US juvenile detention centers from 1997 to 2002. We calculated the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea in males and females, stratified by race/ethnicity, age group, and site. We also calculated the proportion of adolescents with chlamydia that were coinfected with gonorrhea and the proportion of those with gonorrhea that were coinfected with chlamydia. The prevalence of chlamydia was 15.6% in 33,619 females and 5.9% in 98,296 males; gonorrhea prevalence was 5.1% in females and 1.3% in males. Of females with gonorrhea, 54% were coinfected with chlamydia, and 51% of males with gonorrhea were coinfected with chlamydia. Chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence was very high in females in all project sites. In males, chlamydia prevalence was high in some areas; however, gonorrhea prevalence was substantially lower. These prevalence data justify screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea among female adolescents in juvenile detention centers nationally.
Summary:","A study of the prevalence rate of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and their coinfection in an adolescent population (women n=131,915 and men n=71,074) of juvenile detention centers between 1997 and 2002 found that 18% of women and 13% of males with chlamydia were coinfected with gonorrhea."

Query 1: Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis?
Document 1: To examine the effectiveness of methods to improve partner notification by patient referral (index patient has responsibility for informing sex partners of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection). Systematic review of randomised trials of any intervention to supplement simple patient referral. Seven electronic databases searched (January 1990 to December 2005) without language restriction, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection of trials, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was a reduction of incidence or prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in index patients. If this was not reported data were extracted according to a hierarchy of secondary outcomes: number of partners treated; number of partners tested or testing positive; and number of partners notified, located, or elicited. Random effects meta-analysis was carried out when appropriate. 14 trials were included with 12 389 women and men diagnosed as having gonorrhoea, chlamydia, non-gonococcal urethritis, trichomoniasis, or a sexually transmitted infection syndrome. All studies had methodological weaknesses that could have biased their results. Three strategies were used. Six trials examined patient delivered partner therapy. Meta-analysis of five of these showed a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection in patients with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (summary risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.93). Supplementing patient referral with information for partners was as effective as patient delivered partner therapy. Neither strategy was effective in women with trichomoniasis. Two trials found that providing index patients with chlamydia with sampling kits for their partners increased the number of partners who got treated. Involving index patients in shared responsibility for the management of sexual partners improves outcomes. Health professionals should consider the following strategies for the management of individual patients: patient delivered partner therapy, home sampling for partners, and providing additional information for partners.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of the above studies evaluated the effect of expedited partner therapy compared with patient referral on the rate of recurrent or persistent gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis and the number of partners treated per index patient. Empiric therapy was associated with a lower rate of recurrent or persistent infections (risk ratio [RR]=0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.93) and a higher number of partners treated per patient (RR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.86).

Query: What other STI testing should we do for a patient with chlamydia?
Document: These recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are intended for all health-care providers in the public and private sectors, including those working in hospital emergency departments, urgent care clinics, inpatient services, substance abuse treatment clinics, public health clinics, community clinics, correctional health-care facilities, and primary care settings. The recommendations address HIV testing in health-care settings only. They do not modify existing guidelines concerning HIV counseling, testing, and referral for persons at high risk for HIV who seek or receive HIV testing in nonclinical settings (e.g., community-based organizations, outreach settings, or mobile vans). The objectives of these recommendations are to increase HIV screening of patients, including pregnant women, in health-care settings; foster earlier detection of HIV infection; identify and counsel persons with unrecognized HIV infection and link them to clinical and prevention services; and further reduce perinatal transmission of HIV in the United States. These revised recommendations update previous recommendations for HIV testing in health-care settings and for screening of pregnant women (CDC. Recommendations for HIV testing services for inpatients and outpatients in acute-care hospital settings. MMWR 1993;42[No. RR-2]:1-10; CDC. Revised guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral. MMWR 2001;50[No. RR-19]:1-62; and CDC. Revised recommendations for HIV screening of pregnant women. MMWR 2001;50[No. RR-19]:63-85). Major revisions from previously published guidelines are as follows: For patients in all health-care settings HIV screening is recommended for patients in all health-care settings after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened for HIV at least annually. Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing. Prevention counseling should not be required with HIV diagnostic testing or as part of HIV screening programs in health-care settings. For pregnant women HIV screening should be included in the routine panel of prenatal screening tests for all pregnant women. HIV screening is recommended after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing. Repeat screening in the third trimester is recommended in certain jurisdictions with elevated rates of HIV infection among pregnant women.
Summary:","All patients seeking treatment for STDs, including all patients attending STD clinics, should be screened routinely for HIV during each visit for a new complaint, regardless of whether the patient is known or suspected to have specific behavior risks for HIV infection."

Query 1: How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level?
Document 1: To measure the prevalence of cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency in geriatric outpatients as documented by both low serum cobalamin levels and elevations of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and to determine the response to cobalamin treatment. Prospective study screening elderly subjects for cobalamin deficiency using radiodilution cobalamin assays as well as stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methylmalonic acid and homocysteine assays. In patients with serum cobalamin levels < or = 300 pg/mL, the response to cobalamin treatment in the group with levels of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine > 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean for normals was compared with that of those without such elevations. Outpatient geriatric clinics at the VA Medical Center and University Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. One-hundred and fifty-two consecutive outpatients, ages 65 to 99, were screened. Twenty-nine subjects with serum cobalamin levels < or = 300 pg/mL were prospectively evaluated and treated with cobalamin. Cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, complete blood counts, neurologic examination, and neuropsychological testing. The prevalence of cobalamin deficiency as defined by a serum cobalamin level < or = 300 pg/mL and levels of serum methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine elevated to > 3 SD was 14.5% of the screened outpatients. A similar proportion of patients with low normal serum cobalamin levels (between 201 and 300 pg/mL) demonstrated elevated metabolites > 3 SD (56%) compared with patients with low serum cobalamin levels (< or = 200 pg/mL) (62%). Cobalamin therapy caused a marked fall or complete correction of the elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels in each patient who was treated prospectively. Results for complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, baseline neurologic score, and baseline neuropsychologic scores did not differ in the group of patients with elevated metabolites compared with those with normal metabolites. The mean red cell volume fell significantly in the patients with elevated metabolites after 6 months of cobalamin treatment. One patient with elevated metabolites had marked improvement in his neurologic abnormalities after 6 months of cobalamin treatment. There was a high (14.5%) prevalence of cobalamin deficiency as demonstrated by elevations in serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine in addition to low or low normal serum cobalamin levels in elderly outpatients. The serum cobalamin level was insensitive for screening since similar numbers of patients with low normal serum cobalamin levels of 201-300 pg/mL compared with patients with low cobalamin levels (< or = 200 pg/mL) had markedly elevated metabolites which fell with cobalamin treatment. Additional studies will be required to define the full clinical benefit from treatment with Cbl in elderly subjects.
Summary 1: A low-normal B12 level is 150 to 350 pg/mL. Levels less than 150 pg/mL indicate deficiency. Levels greater than 350 pg/mL indicate adequate B12 supply.

Query 2: How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level?
Document 2: The performance of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was compared with the other markers of vitamin B12 deficiency, and the influence of age, renal function, and thyroid status was examined. We examined 937 individuals not treated with vitamin B12 but in whom vitamin B12 deficiency was suspected because of a plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) above 0.28 micromol L(-1) within the past 4 years. Besides laboratory tests, a structured interview and a neurological examination were performed amongst 534 individuals. Amongst these, 140 individuals qualified for a randomized trial (MMA 0.40-2.00 micromol L(-1)). They were randomized to injections with vitamin B12 or placebo and re-examined after 3 months. One university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark. The ROC curves indicate that holoTC (AUC: 0.90) compared favourable with plasma vitamin B12 (AUC: 0.85) for identifying individuals likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency (MMA > or =0.75 micromol L(-1) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) > or =15 micromol L(-1)), and further that holoTC (AUC: 0.91) might replace combined testing with plasma vitamin B12 and the metabolites. No association was observed between the biochemical markers and symptoms and signs possibly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. HoloTC, TC saturation, plasma vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy were significantly associated with plasma creatinine (all with P <0.001). Only tHcy was significantly associated with thyroid stimulating hormone (P=0.02). HoloTC shows promise as first-line tests for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency.
Summary 2: Holotranscobalamin may become a first-choice assay for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency. Studies have shown that it compares favorably with current combined measures (B12 levels, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine). Like current assays, holotranscobalamin is also affected by renal function. It requires further investigation to establish relevant cutoff levels before it can be recommended as a diagnostic strategy.

Query: How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level?
Document: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and rises with age. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B12 which is a considerable source of work for health care professionals. Several case control and case series studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B12 but it is rarely prescribed in this form, other than in Sweden and Canada. Doctors may not be prescribing oral formulations because they are unaware of this option or have concerns regarding effectiveness. To assess the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency. Searches were undertaken of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Lilacs in early 2005. The bibliographies of all relevant papers identified using this strategy were searched. In addition we contacted authors of relevant identified studies and Vitamin B12 research and pharmaceutical companies to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 to treat vitamin B12 deficiency. All abstracts or titles identified by the electronic searches were independently scrutinised by two reviewers. When a difference between reviewers arose, we obtained and reviewed a hard copy of the papers and made decisions by consensus. We obtained a copy of all pre-selected papers and two researchers independently extracted the data from these studies using piloted data extraction forms. The whole group checked whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, and disagreement was decided by consensus. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers and disagreements were brought back to the whole group and resolved by consensus. Two RCT's comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to four months. High oral doses of B12 (1000 mcg and 2000 mcg) were as effective as intramuscular administration in achieving haematological and neurological responses. The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.
Summary:","A Cochrane Collaboration review of oral vitamin B12 replacement found that these high doses seemed as effective as intramuscular vitamin B12 in all B12-deficient patients-even those with pernicious anemia, Crohn's disease, ileal resection, or malabsorption states. The authors of the review recommend a ""further large, pragmatic trial in a primary care setting"" to determine whether oral vitamin B12 is effective for patients with major common cases of malabsorption and to provide additional evidence for cost effectiveness."

Query 1: What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts?
Document 1: The removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is an alternative to traditional excision methods. It is easy to perform with commonly available instruments, and quick. Faster healing and less scarring are advantages because of the small opening through which the cysts are removed. No previous studies have documented recurrence rates of cysts removed by this technique or the recurrence rates following either traditional excision surgery or other alternative minimal excision techniques. We provide data demonstrating that the removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is a viable option with an acceptably low recurrence rate. To evaluate the overall recurrence rates of keratinous and pilar cysts removed by the punch incision technique and rates of recurrence by location and using other cyst characteristics. A preliminary retrospective chart review of cysts removed exclusively by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 was performed. The rate of cyst recurrence and average time to patient-initiated follow-up visit for evaluation and removal were determined. In a second study, a survey requested information on the presence of cyst recurrence. This was mailed to all 646 patients who had cysts removed by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 to evaluate possible cyst recurrence in patients who did not choose to follow-up at the office. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the overall recurrence rates and recurrence rates based on location and other cyst characteristics. Preliminary chart review revealed a recurrence rate of 3.6%, with a mean time to patient-initiated follow-up of 79.3 weeks. In the second study, an analysis of cyst recurrence rates in patients returning the survey revealed an 8.3% recurrence rate. Subanalysis revealed a trend showing that inflamed cysts had a lower recurrence rate. Another trend noted was that cysts removed from the back and ear had the highest recurrence rates (13.8 and 13.0%, respectively) compared to those removed from other locations. Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal. This is the first study to document recurrence rates using the punch incision technique for removal of epithelial cysts. Though most recurrences occur within the first year, there is a delay in patients reporting to their doctors for reexcision, perhaps because recurrent cysts are often asymptomatic. Studies to determine the recurrence rates for cyst excision using other techniques should be performed. The punch incision technique, when properly performed, is a satisfactory removal method with a recurrence rate of less then 10%.
Summary 1: Punch biopsy excision is similar to the minimal excision technique except that the incision is made using a single-use disposable dermal punch following injection of lidocaine. Expulsion of the cyst contents, with cyst wall, via lateral pressure is performed and occasionally followed by closure with one suture.

Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal. This is the first study to document recurrence rates using the punch incision technique for removal of epithelial cysts. Though most recurrences occur within the first year, there is a delay in patients reporting to their doctors for reexcision, perhaps because recurrent cysts are often asymptomatic. Studies to determine the recurrence rates for cyst excision using other techniques should be performed. The punch incision technique, when properly performed, is a satisfactory removal method with a recurrence rate of less then 10%.
Summary 2: Traditional wide excision -involving dissection and removal of the cyst completely from the surrounding tissue through an elliptical incision-is considered the gold standard of treatment. This time-consuming endeavor frequently leads to significant scarring in comparison with minimal excision or punch biopsy, but has almost no recurrence when the cyst wall is entirely removed.

Query: What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts?
Document: The removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is an alternative to traditional excision methods. It is easy to perform with commonly available instruments, and quick. Faster healing and less scarring are advantages because of the small opening through which the cysts are removed. No previous studies have documented recurrence rates of cysts removed by this technique or the recurrence rates following either traditional excision surgery or other alternative minimal excision techniques. We provide data demonstrating that the removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is a viable option with an acceptably low recurrence rate. To evaluate the overall recurrence rates of keratinous and pilar cysts removed by the punch incision technique and rates of recurrence by location and using other cyst characteristics. A preliminary retrospective chart review of cysts removed exclusively by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 was performed. The rate of cyst recurrence and average time to patient-initiated follow-up visit for evaluation and removal were determined. In a second study, a survey requested information on the presence of cyst recurrence. This was mailed to all 646 patients who had cysts removed by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 to evaluate possible cyst recurrence in patients who did not choose to follow-up at the office. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the overall recurrence rates and recurrence rates based on location and other cyst characteristics. Preliminary chart review revealed a recurrence rate of 3.6%, with a mean time to patient-initiated follow-up of 79.3 weeks. In the second study, an analysis of cyst recurrence rates in patients returning the survey revealed an 8.3% recurrence rate. Subanalysis revealed a trend showing that inflamed cysts had a lower recurrence rate. Another trend noted was that cysts removed from the back and ear had the highest recurrence rates (13.8 and 13.0%, respectively) compared to those removed from other locations. Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal.

Summary:","Minimal excision and punch biopsy techniques are purported to produce minimal bleeding, have faster healing times, and produce less scarring."

Query 1: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document 1: In a recently published meta-analysis, investigators asserted that beta-blockers should not be used to treat hypertension. Because the pathophysiology of hypertension differs in older and younger patients, we designed this meta-analysis to clarify the efficacy of beta-blockers in different age groups. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and death. We identified randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in preventing major cardiovascular outcomes. Both authors independently evaluated the eligibility of all trials. Trials enrolling older (mean age at baseline > or = 60 years) patients were separated from those enrolling younger (mean age < 60 years) patients. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Our analysis incorporated data from 145 811 participants in 21 hypertension trials. In placebo-controlled trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio [RR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.99, based on 794 events in 19 414 patients) but not in older patients (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, based on 1115 events in 8019 patients). In active comparator trials, beta-blockers demonstrated similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents in younger patients (1515 events in 30 412 patients, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07) but not in older patients (7405 events in 79 775 patients, RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10), with the excess risk being particularly marked for strokes (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30). beta-blockers should not be considered first-line therapy for older hypertensive patients without another indication for these agents; however, in younger patients beta-blockers are associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Summary 1: A subsequent meta-analysis found that beta-blocker therapy in younger patients (less than 60 years of age) is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Researchers used data from 145,811 participants in 21 hypertension trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio=0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-0.99) but not in older patients (risk ratio=0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.05).

Query 2: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document 2: To quantify the effect of first-line antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates, compared with the other main classes of antihypertensive agents. We identified eligible trials by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, reference lists of previous reviews, and contacting researchers. We extracted data independently in duplicate and conducted meta-analysis by analysing trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of subsequent treatment actually received. Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo (four trials; n = 23,613), diuretics (five trials; n = 18,241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (four trials; n = 44,825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (three trials; n = 10,828). Compared to placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (0.88, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (0.93, 0.81-1.07) or cardiovascular mortality (0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of CCBs (1.24, 1.11-1.40) and RAS inhibitors (1.30, 1.11-1.53), and that on total cardiovascular events less than that of CCBs (1.18, 1.08-1.29). In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment than those on diuretics (1.80; 1.33-2.42) or RAS inhibitors (1.41; 1.29-1.54). Beta-blockers are inferior to CCBs and to RAS inhibitors for reducing several important hard end points. Compared with diuretics, they had similar outcomes, but were less well tolerated. Hence beta-blockers are generally suboptimal first-line antihypertensive drugs.
Summary 2: A recent systematic review found beta blockers to be inferior to calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) for major endpoints of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. This review found beta-blockers had similar outcomes as diuretics but were less well tolerated than diuretics (RR=1.80; 95% CI, 1.33-2.42) or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.41; 1.29-1.54). Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers with placebo (4 trials; n=23,613), diuretics (5 trials; n=18,241), calcium-channel blockers (4 trials; n=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (3 trials; n=10,828). Compared with placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (RR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (RR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (RR=0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (RR=0.93, 0.81-1.07), or cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.24, 1.11-1.40) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.30, 1.11-1.53). The effect on total cardiovascular events was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.18, 1.08-1.29).

Query: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document: beta-Blocker therapy remains substantially underused in cardiac patients despite its proven mortality benefits. Reluctance to prescribe these agents may derive from concerns about their association with symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. To determine the association of beta-blockers with depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction by performing a quantitative review of randomized trials that tested beta-blockers in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension. Randomized trials of beta-blockers used in the treatment of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or hypertension were identified by searching the MEDLINE database for English-language articles (1966-2001). In addition, we searched the reference lists of previously published trials and reviews of beta-blockers for additional studies. Criteria for inclusion of trials in the review were: random allocation of study treatments, placebo control, noncrossover design, enrollment of at least 100 patients, and a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. The initial search produced 475 articles, 42 of which met these criteria. Fifteen of these trials reported on depressive symptoms, fatigue, or sexual dysfunction and were selected for inclusion. For each trial, 1 author abstracted the frequency of adverse events in the beta-blocker and placebo groups and the numbers of patients randomized to the treatment groups. Two other authors verified the counts of events, and all authors adjudicated any discrepancies. Two different types of information on adverse events were abstracted: patient-reported symptoms and withdrawal of therapy due to a specified symptom. We categorized the tested beta-blockers by generation (early vs late) and lipid solubility (high vs low to moderate). The 15 trials involved more than 35,000 subjects. beta-Blocker therapy was not associated with a significant absolute annual increase in risk of reported depressive symptoms (6 per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7 to 19). beta-Blockers were associated with a small significant annual increase in risk of reported fatigue (18 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 5-30), equivalent to 1 additional report of fatigue for every 57 patients treated per year with beta-blockers. beta-Blockers were also associated with a small, significant annual increase in risk of reported sexual dysfunction (5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 2-8), equivalent to one additional report for every 199 patients treated per year. None of the risks of adverse effects differed significantly by degree of beta-blocker lipid solubility. The risk associated with reported fatigue was significantly higher for early-generation than for late-generation beta-blockers (P =.04). The conventional wisdom that beta-blocker therapy is associated with substantial risks of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction is not supported by data from clinical trials. There is no significant increased risk of depressive symptoms and only small increased risks of fatigue and sexual dysfunction. The risks of these adverse effects should be put in the context of the documented benefits of these medications.
Summary:","That said, beta-blockers do have side effects. One meta-analysis found no difference in the development of depression with beta-blocker therapy; however, first-generation beta-blockers (propranolol and timolol) had higher rates of fatigue than did the later beta-blockers. They reported that the risk of fatigue was only 18 per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 5-30) and the risk for sexual dysfunction was 5 per 1000 patients (95% CI, 2-8) for all beta-blockers as a class. Importantly, they also stratified side-effect findings on the basis of lipophilic vs nonlipophilic and found no difference in side effect frequency."

Query 1: What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs?
Document 1: A controlled prospective survey of women taking oestrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives showed increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 14.2 mm Hg and 8.5 mm Hg respectively after four years. The largest increases in individual cases were 36 mm Hg systolic and 20 mm Hg diastolic. Blood pressure returned to pretreatment levels within three months after oral contraceptives had been stopped. These changes in blood pressure were unrelated to the progestogenic potencies of the preparations being taken.
Summary 1: A prospective study which followed 32 women who had taken combined OCs for 1 to 3 years and then stopped found that blood pressures returned to pretreatment levels at 3 months. Systolic pressure fell by 9.7 mm Hg and diastolic by 2.9 mm Hg compared with measurements made 1 month before stopping. No cardiovascular complications were reported among women during this study.

Query 2: What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs?
Document 2: In a survey of 461 women routinely attending family planning clinics, those taking oral contraceptives had significantly higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures than those using non-hormonal contraception.  There appeared to be a dose-response relation of blood pressure to the progestogen component of 2 oral contraceptives with an identical 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol component.  This supports the idea that the progestogen as well as the estrogen component has an etiological role in the rise in blood pressure.  There was a significant correlation of blood pressure with duration of current use of oral contraceptive but not with total duration of use.  There was also a significant negative correlation of blood pressure with time since oral contraceptives were last taken, and women who had stopped using oral contraceptives over a month previously had similar blood pressures to those who had never taken them.  In women taking oral contraceptives, those who had either a history of hypertension in pregnancy or a family history of hypertension had significantly higher mean blood pressures than those who did not.  Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures correlated independently with weight and body mass index, but controlling for the effect of this and age did not affect the above relations.  No significant differences in mean blood pressures were found between different ethnic groups, and there was no relation of blood pressure to reported marital state, social class, parity, smoking, or alcohol use.
Summary 2: A survey study of 461 women attending family planning clinics found that mean blood pressures were significantly higher for those taking OCs than for those using nonhormonal contraception. Elevated blood pressures correlated with duration of current use of OCs but returned to normal soon after stopping OCs. The mean pressures of those who had stopped OCs more than a month were similar to those of women who had never taken an oral contraceptive and significantly lower than those of women who were currently taking OCs.

Query: What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs?
Document: Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of data from 13,358 women showed that oral contraceptive use is associated with a slight but statistically significant (P lesser than .05) rise in mean blood pressure, which is reversible. The age-adjusted proportion of oral contraceptive users with a blood pressure over 140/90 mm Hg was about three times that on nonusers. These findings are caused by a uniform upward shift in the blood pressure distribution of oral contraceptive users compared to nonusers. Women continuing oral contraceptive use had no appreciably greater change in blood pressure between two visits than persistent nonusers. The clinical implications of a mild contraceptive-induced blood pressure elevation (systolic, 5 to 6 mm Hg; diastolic, 1 to 2 mm Hg) remain unsettled but disturbing.
Summary:","Three studies showed that blood pressure elevations due to taking oral contraceptives returned to baseline with discontinuation of the medication. A prospective cohort study followed 13,358 women who were neither pregnant nor postpartum between the ages of 15 and 60. Women who either initiated or resumed using OCs experienced a statistically significant rise of about 4 mm Hg in the systolic pressure and 1 mm Hg in the diastolic pressure. Women who stopped using OCs experienced significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic components (about 5 mm Hg and 1.5 mm Hg, respectively."

Query 1: What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes?
Document 1: Metformin is an anti-hyperglycaemic agent used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes may present long-term complications: micro- (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease). Two meta-analyses have been published before, although only secondary outcomes were assessed. To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycaemic control, body weight, lipid levels, blood pressure, insulinaemia, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were obtained from computerised searches of multiple electronic databases and hand searches of reference lists of relevant trials identified. Date of last search: September 2003. Trials fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: Diabetes mellitus type 2, metformin versus any other oral intervention, assessment of relevant clinical outcome measures, use of random allocation. Two reviewers extracted data, using a standard data extraction form. Data were summarised under a random effects model. Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk. We calculated the risk difference (RD), and the Number Needed to Treat, when it was possible. We collected data of mean and standard deviation from changes to baseline. However many trials reported end point data. This limitation lead to the expression of the results as standardised mean differences (SMD) and an overall SMD was calculated. Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the I-squared statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity. We included for analysis 29 trials with 37 arms (5259 participants), comparing metformin (37 arms and 2007 participants) with sulphonylureas (13 and 1167), placebo (12 and 702), diet (three and 493), thiazolidinediones (three and 132), insulin (two and 439), meglitinides (two and 208), and glucosidase inhibitors (two and 111). Nine studies reported data on primary outcomes. Obese patients allocated to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.009), and for all-cause mortality (P = 0.03). Obese participants assigned to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than overweight patients on conventional treatment for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.004), diabetes-related death (P = 0.03), all-cause mortality (P = 0.01), and myocardial infarction (P = 0.02). Patients assigned to metformin monotherapy showed a significant benefit for glycaemia control, weight, dyslipidaemia, and diastolic blood pressure. Metformin presents a strong benefit for HbA1c when compared with placebo and diet; and a moderated benefit for: glycaemia control, LDL cholesterol, and BMI or weight when compared with sulphonylureas. Metformin may be the first therapeutic option in the diabetes mellitus type 2 with overweight or obesity, as it may prevent some vascular complications, and mortality. Metformin produces beneficial changes in glycaemia control, and moderated in weight, lipids, insulinaemia and diastolic blood pressure. Sulphonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, insulin, and diet fail to show more benefit for glycaemia control, body weight, or lipids, than metformin.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis of head-to-head studies involving metformin showed equal efficacy compared with injected insulin (2 trials, 811 participants), Α-glucosidase inhibitors (2 trials, 223 participants), and non-sulfonylurea secretagogues (2 trials, 413 participants).

Query 2: What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults?
Document 2: The worldwide increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming a major health concern. We aimed to assess the effect of acarbose in preventing or delaying conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. In a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomised trial, we randomly allocated patients with impaired glucose tolerance to 100 mg acarbose or placebo three times daily. The primary endpoint was development of diabetes on the basis of a yearly oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Analyses were by intention to treat. We randomly allocated 714 patients with impaired glucose tolerance to acarbose and 715 to placebo. We excluded 61 (4%) patients because they did not have impaired glucose tolerance or had no postrandomisation data. 211 (31%) of 682 patients in the acarbose group and 130 (19%) of 686 on placebo discontinued treatment early. 221 (32%) patients randomised to acarbose and 285 (42%) randomised to placebo developed diabetes (relative hazard 0.75 [95% CI 0.63-0.90]; p=0.0015). Furthermore, acarbose significantly increased reversion of impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose tolerance (p<0.0001). At the end of the study, treatment with placebo for 3 months was associated with an increase in conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. The most frequent side-effects to acarbose treatment were flatulence and diarrhoea. Acarbose could be used, either as an alternative or in addition to changes in lifestyle, to delay development of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.
Summary 2: In the STOP-NIDDM trial of 1429 persons over 3.3 years of follow-up, acarbose 100 mg 3 times daily resulted in a 9% reduction of progression to diabetes, compared with placebo (NNT=11)

Query: What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes?
Document: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose or miglitol, have the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The true value of these agents, especially in relation to diabetes related mortality and morbidity, has never been investigated in a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. To assess the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors s in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, reference lists of reviews on the topic of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and we contacted experts and manufacturers for additional trials. Date of most recent search: December 2003 (Current Contents) and April 2003 (other databases). Randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks duration comparing alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with any other intervention and that included at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycemic control, lipids, insulin levels, body weight, adverse events. Two reviewers read all abstracts, assessed quality and extracted data independently. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by the judgement of a third reviewer. A statistician checked all extracted data entrance in the database. We attempted to contact all authors for data clarification. We included 41 trials (8130 participants), 30 investigated acarbose, seven miglitol, one trial voglibose and three trials compared different alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Study duration was 24 weeks in most cases and only two studies lasted amply longer than one year. We found only few data on mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Acarbose had a clear effect on glycemic control compared to placebo: glycated haemoglobin -0.8% (95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.7), fasting blood glucose -1.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -1.4 to -0.9), post-load blood glucose -2.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.9). The effect on glycated haemoglobin by acarbose was not dose-dependent. We found a decreasing effect on post-load insulin and no clinically relevant effects on lipids or body weight. Adverse effects were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin and dose dependent. Compared to sulphonylurea, acarbose decreased fasting and post-load insulin levels by -24.8 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -43.3 to -6.3) and -133.2 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -184.5 to -81.8) respectively and acarbose caused more adverse effects. It remains unclear whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors influence mortality or morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conversely, they have a significant effect on glycemic control and insulin levels, but no statistically significant effect on lipids and body weight. These effects are less sure when alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are used for a longer duration. Acarbose dosages higher than 50 mg TID offer no additional effect on glycated hemoglobin but more adverse effects instead. Compared to sulphonylurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors lower fasting and post-load insulin levels and have an inferior profile regarding glycemic control and adverse effects.
Summary:","A meta-analysis of head to head studies involving Α-glucosidase inhibitors included 8 trials comparing acarbose with sulfonylureas. In pooled results, sulfonylureas trended towards greater HbA1c reduction but did not reach significance (additional HbA1c decrease 0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-0.8%)."

Query 1: What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes?
Document 1: To compare the abilities and associated hypoglycemia risks of insulin glargine and human NPH insulin added to oral therapy of type 2 diabetes to achieve 7% HbA(1c). In a randomized, open-label, parallel, 24-week multicenter trial, 756 overweight men and women with inadequate glycemic control (HbA(1c) >7.5%) on one or two oral agents continued prestudy oral agents and received bedtime glargine or NPH once daily, titrated using a simple algorithm seeking a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <or=100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l). Outcome measures were FPG, HbA(1c), hypoglycemia, and percentage of patients reaching HbA(1c) <or=7% without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia. Mean FPG at end point was similar with glargine and NPH (117 vs. 120 mg/dl [6.5 vs. 6.7 mmol/l]), as was HbA(1c) (6.96 vs. 6.97%). A majority of patients ( approximately 60%) attained HbA(1c) <or=7% with each insulin type. However, nearly 25% more patients attained this without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia (<or=72 mg/dl [4.0 mmol/l]) with glargine (33.2 vs. 26.7%, P < 0.05). Moreover, rates of other categories of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 21-48% lower with glargine. Systematically titrating bedtime basal insulin added to oral therapy can safely achieve 7% HbA(1c) in a majority of overweight patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA(1c) between 7.5 and 10.0% on oral agents alone. In doing this, glargine causes significantly less nocturnal hypoglycemia than NPH, thus reducing a leading barrier to initiating insulin. This simple regimen may facilitate earlier and effective insulin use in routine medical practice, improving achievement of recommended standards of diabetes care.
Summary 1: An open-label randomized controlled trials of 756 patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c >7.5%, mean 8.6%) on either 1 or 2 oral agents (70% taking both metformin and a sulfonylurea) compared combination therapy using bedtime insulin glargine with combination therapy using morning NPH. Each group titrated insulin doses to achieve a target fasting glucose ≤100. By 24 weeks, both groups had equivalently reduced HbA1c (mean HbA1c=6.96% with glargine, and 6.97% with NPH; P=NS), but fewer patients experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia with glargine than with NPH (33.2% vs 26.7%, P<.05).

Query 2: What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes?
Document 2: In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage. Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268). Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78). Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.
Summary 2: In 12 trials with 2067 patients, metformin decreased HbA1c more than sulfonylureas did (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.14; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.01). In 3 trials with 246 patients, metformin also produced greater HbA1c decreases than thiazolidinediones (SMD -0.28; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.03). In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), metformin improved diabetes-related outcomes and all-cause mortality in obese patients (relative risk of mortality=0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97; P=.03; number needed to treat [NNT]=19).

Query: What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes?
Document: Effective type 2 diabetes management requires prompt intervention if glycemic control is not achieved by nonpharmacological means. This study investigates whether inhaled insulin (INH; Exubera) can achieve target glycemic control in patients failing on diet and exercise. Patients with suboptimal control on diet and exercise (HbA(1c) [A1C] 8-11%) were randomized to 3 months' treatment with either INH before meals (n = 76) or rosiglitazone 4 mg twice a day (n = 69), in conjunction with a diet and exercise regimen. The primary end point was percentage of patients achieving A1C <8.0%. The INH and rosiglitazone groups had comparable baseline A1C values (9.5 vs. 9.4%, respectively). Significantly more patients achieved A1C <8.0% (83 vs. 58%, adjusted odds ratio 7.14 [95% CI 2.48-20.58], P = 0.0003), A1C <7.0% (44 vs. 18%, 4.43 [1.94-10.12]), and A1C < or = 6.5% (28 vs. 7.5% 5.34 [1.83-15.57]) with INH. A1C decrease was greater with INH (-2.3% vs. -1.4%, adjusted treatment group difference: -0.89% [95% CI -1.23 to -0.55]) with final mean A1C values of 7.2 and 8.0% for INH and rosiglitazone, respectively. Hypoglycemia (episodes per subject-month) was higher with INH (0.7 vs. 0.05, risk ratio 14.72 [95% CI 7.51-28.83]), with no severe hypoglycemic episodes. Pulmonary function changes were small and comparable between groups. INH could be an effective therapy for people with type 2 diabetes early in the course of their disease.
Summary:","Inhaled insulin may expand the list of initial therapies for type 2 diabetes. A 12-week manufacturer-sponsored RCT with 134 patients (mean HbA1c=9.5) compared inhaled insulin with rosiglitazone (Avandia). More patients using inhaled insulin achieved an HbA1c <8.0 (82.7% vs 58.2%; P=.0003); however, inhaled insulin produced more adverse effects, including cough and hypoglycemia."

Query 1: What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes?
Document 1: To compare the abilities and associated hypoglycemia risks of insulin glargine and human NPH insulin added to oral therapy of type 2 diabetes to achieve 7% HbA(1c). In a randomized, open-label, parallel, 24-week multicenter trial, 756 overweight men and women with inadequate glycemic control (HbA(1c) >7.5%) on one or two oral agents continued prestudy oral agents and received bedtime glargine or NPH once daily, titrated using a simple algorithm seeking a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <or=100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l). Outcome measures were FPG, HbA(1c), hypoglycemia, and percentage of patients reaching HbA(1c) <or=7% without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia. Mean FPG at end point was similar with glargine and NPH (117 vs. 120 mg/dl [6.5 vs. 6.7 mmol/l]), as was HbA(1c) (6.96 vs. 6.97%). A majority of patients ( approximately 60%) attained HbA(1c) <or=7% with each insulin type. However, nearly 25% more patients attained this without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia (<or=72 mg/dl [4.0 mmol/l]) with glargine (33.2 vs. 26.7%, P < 0.05). Moreover, rates of other categories of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 21-48% lower with glargine. Systematically titrating bedtime basal insulin added to oral therapy can safely achieve 7% HbA(1c) in a majority of overweight patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA(1c) between 7.5 and 10.0% on oral agents alone. In doing this, glargine causes significantly less nocturnal hypoglycemia than NPH, thus reducing a leading barrier to initiating insulin. This simple regimen may facilitate earlier and effective insulin use in routine medical practice, improving achievement of recommended standards of diabetes care.

Query 2: What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes?
Document 2: Few large randomized controlled trials have assessed the value of adding insulin to an oral antidiabetic drug regimen. This trial compared the efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) plus pioglitazone (n = 93), glibenclamide (glyburide) plus pioglitazone (n = 91), or BIAsp 30 monotherapy (n = 97). This 18-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial involved 281 patients with type 2 diabetes (60% male; mean age, 56 years; mean body mass index, 29.5 kg/m2) with inadequate glycemic control (mean glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], 9.5%; range, 7.4%-14.7%) on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy. The primary objective was to compare end-of-trial HbA(1c) among the 3 treatment groups. Fasting and mean 7- and 8-point blood glucose profiles, blood lipid levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, adverse events, and hypoglycemia frequency were also compared. Patients using BIAsp 30 (alone or with pioglitazone) were injected twice daily (immediately before breakfast and dinner). Pioglitazone (30 mg/d) and glibenclamide (5-15 mg/d) were taken orally once daily with or immediately after breakfast. At the end of the trial, HbA(1c) was significantly lower for the BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone group than for the glibenclamide plus pioglitazone group (mean [SD], -0.64% [0.23%]; P = 0.005) and the BIAsp 30 monotherapy group (-0.60% [0.22%]; P = 0.008). Mean (SD) fasting blood glucose (before breakfast) was significantly lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (153 [45] mg/dL vs 169 [65] mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.012). Each time point on the 8-point blood glucose profile was lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05). No major hypoglycemic episodes were reported, and the absolute rate of hypoglycemic events was low (<1 event/patient-week) in the BIAsp-only group. Edema was reported in < or =9% of patients in each treatment group, but no occurrence was classified as serious. Weight gain (mean, 4.0 kg) was more common in the BIAsp plus pioglitazone group (8%); however, this was consistent with improved glycemic control and is similar to that reported in other pioglitazone trials. BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone provided an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment alternative to glibenclamide plus pioglitazone or BIAsp 30 alone in this population of patients who previously were not well controlled on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy.
Summary 2: An open-label randomized controlled trials evaluated 281 patients with at least 3 months of inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c=7.4%-14.7%) on a sulfonylurea. Patients were randomized to a) switching to a combination of biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 plus pioglitazone, b) adding pioglitazone to the sulfonylurea, or c) switching to insulin alone (biphasic insulin aspart 30/70). After 18 weeks, insulin plus pioglitazone reduced HbA1c significantly more than either glyburide plus pioglitazone (P=.005) or insulin alone (P=.005). However, the insulin plus pioglitazone group had the most weight gain (mean 4 kg, similar to other pioglitazone trials). There were no major hypoglycemic events.

Query: What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes?
Document: It is unclear whether patients with type 2 diabetes who have poor glycaemic control despite maximal oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) should be commenced on insulin as monotherapy, or insulin combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents (insulin-OHA combination therapy). To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy versus insulin-OHA combinations therapy. Eligible studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Date of last search: May 2004. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 2 months minimum follow-up duration comparing insulin monotherapy (all schemes) with insulin-OHA combination therapy. Data extraction and assessment of study quality were undertaken by three reviewers in pairs. Twenty RCTs (mean trial duration 10 months) including 1,811 participants, with mean age 59.8 years and mean known duration of diabetes 9.6 years. Overall, study methodological quality was low. Twenty-eight comparisons in 20 RCTs were ordered according to clinical considerations. No studies assessed diabetes-related morbidity, mortality or total mortality. From 13 studies (21 comparisons), sufficient data were extracted to calculate pooled effects on glycaemic control. Insulin-OHA combination therapy had statistically significant benefits on glycaemic control over insulin monotherapy only when the latter was applied as a once-daily injection of NPH insulin. Conversely, twice-daily insulin monotherapy (NPH or mixed insulin) provided superior glycaemic control to insulin-OHA combination therapy regimens where insulin was administered as a single morning injection. In more conventional comparisons, regimens utilising OHAs with bedtime NPH insulin provided comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy (administered as twice daily, or multiple daily injections). Overall, insulin-OHA combination therapy was associated with a 43% relative reduction in total daily insulin requirement compared to insulin monotherapy. Of the 14 studies (22 comparisons) reporting hypoglycaemia, 13 demonstrated no significant difference in the frequency of symptomatic or biochemical hypoglycaemia between insulin and combination therapy regimens. No significant differences in quality of life related issues were detected. Combination therapy with bedtime NPH insulin resulted in statistically significantly less weight gain compared to insulin monotherapy, provided metformin was used +/-sulphonylurea. In all other comparisons no significant differences with respect to weight gain were detected. Bedtime NPH insulin combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents provides comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy and is associated with less weight gain if metformin is used.
Summary:","A systematic review evaluated beginning combination therapy (adding insulin to oral medication) compared with switching to insulin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on oral medication. Twenty RCTs studied a total of 1811 patients; glycemic control was the primary outcome measure. Oral medication comprised either sulfonylureas (75%), metformin (4%), or both (21%). Individual studies used different insulin dosing schedules and statistical measures. However, overall, combination therapy provided glucose control comparable with insulin alone. In only 1 small, low-quality study did insulin plus metformin reduce HbA1c more than other combination therapy regimens or insulin alone. Ten studies reported a trend toward less weight gain with combination therapy that included metformin. Fourteen studies found the same incidence of hypoglycemic episodes in combination therapy and insulin alone."

Query 1: Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment?
Document 1: To assess the potential of anticholinergic drugs as a cause of non-degenerative mild cognitive impairment in elderly people. Longitudinal cohort study. 63 randomly selected general practices in the Montpellier region of southern France. 372 people aged > 60 years without dementia at recruitment. Anticholinergic burden from drug use, cognitive examination, and neurological assessment. 9.2% of subjects continuously used anticholinergic drugs during the year before cognitive assessment. Compared with non-users, they had poorer performance on reaction time, attention, delayed non-verbal memory, narrative recall, visuospatial construction, and language tasks but not on tasks of reasoning, immediate and delayed recall of wordlists, and implicit memory. Eighty per cent of the continuous users were classified as having mild cognitive impairment compared with 35% of non-users, and anticholinergic drug use was a strong predictor of mild cognitive impairment (odds ratio 5.12, P = 0.001). No difference was found between users and non-users in risk of developing dementia at follow-up after eight years. Elderly people taking anticholinergic drugs had significant deficits in cognitive functioning and were highly likely to be classified as mildly cognitively impaired, although not at increased risk for dementia. Doctors should assess current use of anticholinergic drugs in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment before considering administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
Summary 1: A longitudinal cohort study found that patients taking anticholinergic drugs had an 80% prevalence of MCI, compared with a 35% prevalence in a matched population of patients not using these drugs; yet Alzheimer's disease had not increased among the anticholinergic drug users at 8-year follow-up. Attributable risk for mild cognitive impairment from anticholinergic drug use was 19%. Stopping anticholinergic medications may reduce the prevalence of MCI.

Query 2: Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment?
Document 2: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are the only drugs marketed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Despite numerous randomized controlled trials, the efficacy and safety of this group of medications has not been quantified. Our objective was to quantitatively summarize data on the efficacy and safety of ChEIs in Alzheimer's disease in a format useful to clinicians. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of currently marketed ChEIs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine), used in therapeutic doses for at least 12 weeks, from which a cognitive outcome was reported. Studies were identified through 3 electronic databases searched to May 2002, pharmaceutical companies and journals. We extracted the proportions of subjects who responded, experienced adverse events, discontinued treatment for any reason or discontinued treatment because of adverse events. In the 16 identified trials that met the inclusion criteria, 5159 patients were treated with a ChEI and 2795 received a placebo. The pooled mean proportion of global responders to ChEI treatment in excess of that for placebo treatment was 9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6%-12%). The rates of adverse events, dropout for any reason and dropout because of adverse events were also higher among the patients receiving ChEI treatment than among those receiving placebo, the excess proportions being 8% (95% CI 5%-11%), 8% (95% CI 5%-11%) and 7% (95% CI 3%-10%), respectively. The numbers needed to treat for 1 additional patient to benefit were 7 (95% CI 6-9) for stabilization or better, 12 (95% CI 9-16) for minimal improvement or better and 42 (95% CI 26-114) for marked improvement; the number needed to treat for 1 additional patient to experience an adverse event was 12 (95% CI 10-18). Treatment with ChEIs results in a modest but significant therapeutic effect and modestly but significantly higher rates of adverse events and discontinuation of treatment. The numbers needed to treat to benefit 1 additional patient are small.
Summary 2: In established Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors statistically benefit patients with early and moderate disease and probably benefit patients with severe disease. The treatment effect is small, however-3 points on a 70-point cognitive scale.

Query: What could be behind your elderly patient's subjective memory complaints?
Document: Behavioural brain reserve is a property of the central nervous system related to sustained and complex mental activity which can lead to differential expression of brain injury. Behavioural brain reserve has been assessed using autobiographical data such as education levels, occupational complexity and mentally stimulating lifestyle pursuits. So far there have been several epidemiological reports but no systematic review to put conflicting results into context. Our aim was to quantitatively review evidence for the effect of brain reserve on incident dementia. Cohort studies of the effects of education, occupation, premorbid IQ and mental activities on dementia risk were of interest. Abstracts were identified in MEDLINE (1966-September 2004), CURRENT CONTENTS (to September, 2004), PsychINFO (1984-September 2004), Cochrane Library Databases and reference lists from relevant articles. Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Key information was extracted by both reviewers onto a standard template with a high level of agreement. Studies were combined through a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis. Higher brain reserve was associated with a lowered risk for incident dementia (summary odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.59). This effect was found over a median of 7.1 years follow-up and resulted from integrating data across more than 29000 individuals. Notably, increased complex mental activity in late life was associated with lower dementia rates independent of other predictors; a dose-response relationship was also evident between extent of complex mental activities in late life and dementia risk. This study demonstrates robust evidence that complex patterns of mental activity in the early, mid- and late-life stages is associated with a significant reduction in dementia incidence. Randomized control trials based on brain-reserve principles are now required.
Summary:","One systematic review of 22 longitudinal cohort studies, which included more than 29,000 patients, evaluated complex patterns of mental activity in early, mid-, and late-life in relation to the incidence of dementia. Dementia was diagnosed at a significantly lower rate in patients with a higher level of cognitive exercise, such as memory-based leisure activities and social interactions, than those with less rigorous daily cognitive challenges (relative risk=0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59)."

Query 1: Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 1: This Task Force report by the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology evaluates the safety and efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) antidepressants for depressed youth under 18 years. The report was undertaken after regulatory agencies in the United States and United Kingdom raised concerns in 2003 about the possibility that treatment of depression in children and adolescents with SSRIs may increase the risk of suicidal thinking or suicide attempts.
Summary 1: American College of Neuropsychopharmacology argues that the risk-to-benefit ratio favors drug treatment for moderate to severe adolescent depression.

Query 2: Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 2: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders. PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial. Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.
Summary 2: Fifteen well-designed trials have examined the efficacy of antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder in youth. All reported the changes in total scores on standard depression scales: the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, Clinical Global Impressions, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children.

Query: Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document: Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used, however, evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of SSRIs compared to placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. We searched the CCDAN Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CENTRAL. Reference lists were checked, letters were sent to key researchers and internet databases searched. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed the quality and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. The relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures. Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion, with ten providing usable data. At 8-12 weeks, there was evidence that children and adolescents 'responded' to treatment with SSRIs (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.41). There was also evidence of an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour for those prescribed SSRIs (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.72). Fluoxetine was the only SSRI where there was consistent evidence from three trials that it was effective in reducing depression symptoms in both children and adolescents (CDRS-R treatment effect -5.63, 95% CI -7.38 to -3.88), and 'response' to treatment (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.32). Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed SSRIs. Caution is required to interpret the results. First, there were methodological issues, including high attrition, issues regarding measurement instruments and clinical usefulness of outcomes, often variously defined across trials. Second, patients seen in clinical practice are likely to be more unwell, and at greater risk of suicide, compared to those in the trials, and it is unclear how this group would respond to SSRIs. This needs to be considered, along with the evidence of an increased risk of suicide related outcomes in those treated with SSRIs. It is unclear what the effect of SSRIs is on suicide completion. While untreated depression is associated with the risk of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, it is unclear whether SSRIs would modify this risk in a clinically meaningful way.
Summary:","A 2007 Cochrane review supports the use of SSRIs to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents, reporting efficacy as 1.28 times that of placebo (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.41). Quality of available clinical evidence is limited. Statistical significance was demonstrated in meta-analyses only when data from smaller trials were combined. Fluoxetine was the only antidepressant studied in nonindustry-sponsored trials for major depressive disorder in adolescents. Moreover, results are not often reported separately for children (5-12 years of age) and adolescents (12-18 years of age)."

Query 1: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document 1: To quantify the effect of first-line antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates, compared with the other main classes of antihypertensive agents. We identified eligible trials by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, reference lists of previous reviews, and contacting researchers. We extracted data independently in duplicate and conducted meta-analysis by analysing trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of subsequent treatment actually received. Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo (four trials; n = 23,613), diuretics (five trials; n = 18,241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (four trials; n = 44,825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (three trials; n = 10,828). Compared to placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (0.88, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (0.93, 0.81-1.07) or cardiovascular mortality (0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of CCBs (1.24, 1.11-1.40) and RAS inhibitors (1.30, 1.11-1.53), and that on total cardiovascular events less than that of CCBs (1.18, 1.08-1.29). In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment than those on diuretics (1.80; 1.33-2.42) or RAS inhibitors (1.41; 1.29-1.54). Beta-blockers are inferior to CCBs and to RAS inhibitors for reducing several important hard end points. Compared with diuretics, they had similar outcomes, but were less well tolerated. Hence beta-blockers are generally suboptimal first-line antihypertensive drugs.
Summary 1: A recent systematic review found beta blockers to be inferior to calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) for major endpoints of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. This review found beta-blockers had similar outcomes as diuretics but were less well tolerated than diuretics (RR=1.80; 95% CI, 1.33-2.42) or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.41; 1.29-1.54). Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers with placebo (4 trials; n=23,613), diuretics (5 trials; n=18,241), calcium-channel blockers (4 trials; n=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (3 trials; n=10,828). Compared with placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (RR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (RR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (RR=0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (RR=0.93, 0.81-1.07), or cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.24, 1.11-1.40) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.30, 1.11-1.53). The effect on total cardiovascular events was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.18, 1.08-1.29).

Query 2: Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension?
Document 2: In a recently published meta-analysis, investigators asserted that beta-blockers should not be used to treat hypertension. Because the pathophysiology of hypertension differs in older and younger patients, we designed this meta-analysis to clarify the efficacy of beta-blockers in different age groups. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and death. We identified randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in preventing major cardiovascular outcomes. Both authors independently evaluated the eligibility of all trials. Trials enrolling older (mean age at baseline > or = 60 years) patients were separated from those enrolling younger (mean age < 60 years) patients. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Our analysis incorporated data from 145 811 participants in 21 hypertension trials. In placebo-controlled trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio [RR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.99, based on 794 events in 19 414 patients) but not in older patients (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, based on 1115 events in 8019 patients). In active comparator trials, beta-blockers demonstrated similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents in younger patients (1515 events in 30 412 patients, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07) but not in older patients (7405 events in 79 775 patients, RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10), with the excess risk being particularly marked for strokes (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30). beta-blockers should not be considered first-line therapy for older hypertensive patients without another indication for these agents; however, in younger patients beta-blockers are associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Summary 2: A subsequent meta-analysis found that beta-blocker therapy in younger patients (less than 60 years of age) is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Researchers used data from 145,811 participants in 21 hypertension trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio=0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-0.99) but not in older patients (risk ratio=0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.05).

Query: What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure?
Document: To briefly discuss the pathophysiology of heart failure and the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered. Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.
Summary:",The US Carvedilol trial had several methodologic problems: it was a composite of 4 smaller studies that used exercise tolerance as the primary endpoint; median duration of data collection on subjects was only 6 months; it included many minimally symptomatic patients; the actual number of deaths was small (producing a wide confidence interval); and subjects who did not survive the run-in phase were excluded from analysis.

Query 1: What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure?
Document 1: Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown. A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause. The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P=0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P=0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99). In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.
Summary 1: In contrast, the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) demonstrated no effect with bucindolol.

Query 2: Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure?
Document 2: Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure are associated with increased rates of overall mortality and sudden death. Amiodarone is now used widely to prevent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conducted a trial to determine whether amiodarone can reduce overall mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 674 patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement, 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients). The primary end point was overall mortality, and the median follow-up was 45 months (range, 0 to 54). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups (P = 0.6). The two-year actuarial survival rate was 69.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 64.2 to 74.6) for the patients in the amiodarone group and 70.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 65.7 to 75.9) for those in the placebo group. At two years, the rate of sudden death was 15 percent in the amiodarone group and 19 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.43). There was a trend toward a reduction in overall mortality among the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received amiodarone (P = 0.07). Amiodarone was significantly more effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction by 42 percent at two years. Although amiodarone was effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and improving ventricular function, it did not reduce the incidence of sudden death or prolong survival among patients with heart failure, except for a trend toward reduced mortality among those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Summary 2: The largest placebo-controlled trial in heart failure failed to detect a significant decrease in sudden death.

Query: What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure?
Document: Controlled clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in chronic heart failure, but the effect of these drugs on survival has not been determined. We enrolled 1094 patients with chronic heart failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified program, in which patients were assigned to one of the four treatment protocols on the basis of their exercise capacity. Within each of the four protocols patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 398) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (n = 696); background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Patient were observed for the occurrence death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons during the following 6 months, after the beginning (12 months for the group with mild heart failure). The overall mortality rate was 7.8 percent in the placebo group and 3.2 percent in the carvedilol group; the reduction in risk attributable to carvedilol was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 80 percent; P < 0.001). This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. In addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.6 percent vs, 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol than in the placebo group. Carvedilol reduces the risk or death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.
Summary:",The US Carvedilol trial demonstrated a larger reduction in mortality than that seen in other beta-blocker trials.

Document: At 32-month follow-up of older patients with prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction > or = 40% treated with diuretics plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and also with digoxin if atrial fibrillation was present, propranolol caused a 35% significant reduction in total mortality and a 37% significant decrease in total mortality plus nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with no propranolol. At 1-year follow-up, propranolol caused a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (6%) and a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass (34 g) than did no propranolol (2% and 20 g, respectively).
Summary:",No large studies of older beta-blockers adequately assess mortality in heart failure. One study of propranolol (N=158) showed a 27% reduction in mortality in mild heart failure in the setting of ischemic heart disease.

Query 1: What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure?
Document 1: Both metoprolol and carvedilol produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with chronic heart failure; carvedilol exerts greater antiadrenergic effects than metoprolol, but it is unknown whether this pharmacological difference results in hemodynamic and clinical differences between the 2 drugs. We randomized 150 patients with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction </=0.35) to double-blind treatment with either metoprolol or carvedilol. When compared with metoprolol (124+/-55 mg/d), patients treated with carvedilol (49+/-18 mg/d) showed larger increases in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (+10.9+/-11.0 versus +7.2+/-7.7 U, P=0.038) and in left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work during exercise (both P<0. 05) after 13 to 15 months of treatment. In addition, carvedilol produced greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during exercise, than metoprolol (all P<0.05). In contrast, the metoprolol group showed greater increases in maximal exercise capacity than the carvedilol group (P=0.035), but the 2 drugs improved symptoms, submaximal exercise tolerance, and quality of life to a similar degree. After a mean of 23+/-11 months of follow-up, 21 patients in the metoprolol group and 17 patients in the carvedilol group died or underwent urgent transplantation. The present study demonstrates that during long-term therapy, carvedilol improves cardiac performance to a greater extent than metoprolol when administered to patients with heart failure in the doses shown to be effective in clinical trials. These differences were likely related to a greater antiadrenergic activity of carvedilol.
Summary 1: A large randomized controlled trial compared carvedilol and metoprolol head-to-head. It included 150 subjects with ejection fractions below 35% who were randomized to 1 of the 2 drugs and followed for more than 3 years. Symptom scores and quality of life assessments were similar in the 2 groups. A trend toward lower mortality in the carvedilol group did not reach statistical significance. Peak oxygen uptake during exercise was greater in the metoprolol group. The carvedilol group had a statistically greater improvement in ejection fraction (+10.9 ± 11.0 vs +7.2 ± 7.7 at rest).

Query: What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure?
Document: In large clinical trials both carvedilol and metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist, which inhibits beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol has additional metabolic and antioxidant properties. Metoprolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) is the first study to investigate whether beta-blocking agents with differing pharmacological profiles exert different effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 3029 patients from 15 different European countries were enrolled into COMET and will be followed until 1020 fatal events have been observed, unless the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) recommends early termination. The target dose for carvedilol is 25 mg bid and for metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. This manuscript outlines the rationale, design and possible outcomes of COMET.
Summary:","The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), a larger head-to-head trial of carvedilol and metoprolol (N=3029), is ongoing."

Query 1: Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing?
Document 1: Fluoride toothpastes have been widely used for over three decades and remain a benchmark intervention for the prevention of dental caries. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride toothpastes in the prevention of caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride toothpaste with placebo in children up to 16 years during at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects meta-regression analyses. Seventy-four studies were included. For the 70 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 42,300 children) the D(M)FS pooled PF was 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21 to 28%; p<0.0001). This means that 1.6 children need to brush with a fluoride toothpaste (rather than a non-fluoride toothpaste) over three years to prevent one D(M)FS in populations with caries increment of 2.6 D(M)FS per year. In populations with caries increment of 1.1 D(M)FS per year, 3.7 children will need to use a fluoride toothpaste for three years to avoid one D(M)FS. There was clear heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p<0.0001). The effect of fluoride toothpaste increased with higher baseline levels of D(M)FS, higher fluoride concentration, higher frequency of use, and supervised brushing, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation. There is little information concerning the deciduous dentition or adverse effects (fluorosis). Supported by more than half a century of research, the benefits of fluoride toothpastes are firmly established. Taken together, the trials are of relatively high quality, and provide clear evidence that fluoride toothpastes are efficacious in preventing caries.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis found that the effect of topical fluoride was independent of water fluoridation, suggesting that topical fluoride toothpaste has a beneficial effect even in communities with fluoridated water.

Query: Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing?
Document: Topical fluorides in the form of toothpaste, mouthrinse, varnish and gel are effective caries preventive measures. However, there is uncertainty about the relative value of these interventions. To compare the effectiveness of one form of topical fluoride intervention with another when used for the prevention of dental caries in children. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride varnish, gel, mouthrinse, or toothpaste with each other in children up to 16 years during at least 1 year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increments between the 'experimental' and 'control' groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. There were 17 studies included, and 15 contributed data for the meta-analyses. Fluoride toothpaste was not significantly different from mouthrinse (pooled DMFS PF 0%; 95% CI, -18% to 19%; p = 0.94), or gel (pooled DMFS PF 0%; 95% CI, -21% to 21%; p = 1), or both gel and mouthrinse (pooled DMFS PF 1%; 95% CI, -13% to 14%; p = 0.94); heterogeneity was substantial. Results from the single trial comparing toothpaste with varnish (in deciduous teeth) were inconclusive (dfs PF 5%; CI not obtainable). The pooled results from the comparisons of fluoride varnish with mouthrinse was a non-significant difference favouring varnish (DMFS PF 10%; 95% CI, -12% to 32%; p = 0.40), but this result was not robust to sensitivity analysis performed, and heterogeneity was considerable. Results from the single trial comparing varnish with gel (14%, 95% CI, -12% to 40%; p = 0.30) and the single trial comparing gel with mouthrinse (-14% DMFS PF; 95% CI, -40% to 12%; p = 0.30) were inconclusive (favoured varnish and mouthrinse respectively). Fluoride toothpastes in comparison to mouthrinses or gels appear to have a similar degree of effectiveness for the prevention of dental caries in children. There is no clear suggestion that fluoride varnish is more effective than mouthrinses and the evidence for the comparative effectiveness of fluoride varnishes and gels, and mouthrinses and gels is inconclusive. No conclusions about adverse effects could be reached, because no data were reported on in the trials. Acceptance is likely to be greater for fluoride toothpaste.
Summary:",Another Cochrane review found 17 randomized controlled trials comparing different methods of topical fluoride application in children. The limited data suggested that fluoride toothpaste is as effective as mouth rinse or gel.

Query 1: Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing?
Document 1: Fluoride toothpastes have been widely used for over three decades and remain a benchmark intervention for the prevention of dental caries. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride toothpastes in the prevention of caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride toothpaste with placebo in children up to 16 years during at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects meta-regression analyses. Seventy-four studies were included. For the 70 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 42,300 children) the D(M)FS pooled PF was 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21 to 28%; p<0.0001). This means that 1.6 children need to brush with a fluoride toothpaste (rather than a non-fluoride toothpaste) over three years to prevent one D(M)FS in populations with caries increment of 2.6 D(M)FS per year. In populations with caries increment of 1.1 D(M)FS per year, 3.7 children will need to use a fluoride toothpaste for three years to avoid one D(M)FS. There was clear heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p<0.0001). The effect of fluoride toothpaste increased with higher baseline levels of D(M)FS, higher fluoride concentration, higher frequency of use, and supervised brushing, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation. There is little information concerning the deciduous dentition or adverse effects (fluorosis). Supported by more than half a century of research, the benefits of fluoride toothpastes are firmly established. Taken together, the trials are of relatively high quality, and provide clear evidence that fluoride toothpastes are efficacious in preventing caries.
Summary 1: A meta-analysis found that the effect of topical fluoride was independent of water fluoridation, suggesting that topical fluoride toothpaste has a beneficial effect even in communities with fluoridated water.

Query: Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing?
Document: Topical fluoride therapy (TFT) in the form of varnish, gel, mouthrinse or toothpaste has been used extensively as a caries-preventive intervention for over three decades. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride varnishes, gels, mouthrinses, and toothpastes in the prevention of dental caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride varnish, gel, mouthrinse, or toothpaste with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years during at least 1 year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects metaregression analyses. There were 144 studies included. For the 133 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 65,169 children) the D(M)FS pooled prevented fraction estimate was 26% (95% CI, 24% to 29%; p < 0.0001). There was substantial heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p < 0.0001), but the direction of effect was consistent. The effect of topical fluoride varied according to type of control group used, type of TFT used, mode/setting of TFT use, initial caries levels and intensity of TFT application, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation or other fluoride sources. D(M)FS PF was on average 14% (95% CI, 5% to 23%; p = 0.002) higher in non-placebo controlled trials, 14% (95% CI, 2% to 26%; p = 0.25) higher in fluoride varnish trials compared with all others, and 10% (95% CI, -17% to -3%; p = 0.003) lower in trials of unsupervised home use compared with self applied supervised and operator-applied. There was a 0.7% increase in the PF per unit increase in baseline caries (95% CI, 0.2% to 1.2%; p = 0.004). The benefits of topical fluorides have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical fluorides, because data reported in the trials are scarce.
Summary:","A large Cochrane review evaluated topical fluoride therapy in the form of toothpaste, mouth rinse, varnish, or gel. Based on 133 randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (n=65,169), the meta-analysis indicated a 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24%-29%) reduction in decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces in children."

Query 1: Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later?
Document 1: Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formula can be advocated for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without evidence of allergy or food intolerance. To determine the effect of feeding hydrolysed formulas on allergy and food intolerance in infants and children compared to adapted cow's milk or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively and partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit, including infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or prolonged formula feeding. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The review was updated with searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006) and CINAHL (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's milk formula. Trials with >80% follow up of participants were eligible for inclusion. Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. No significant difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA) were reported. No eligible trial compared prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula feeding. No significant benefits were reported. One large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). Ten eligible studies compared prolonged feeding with hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula in high risk infants. Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant allergy (seven studies, 2514 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.94), but not in the incidence of childhood allergy (two studies, 950 infants; typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.05). There was no significant difference in infant eczema (eight studies, 2558 infants, typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04), childhood eczema incidence (two studies, 950 infants, typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63, 1.10), childhood eczema prevalence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43, 1.02), or infant or childhood asthma, rhinitis and food allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in infants with CMA with confirmed atopy (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.89). Subgroup analysis of trials blinded to formula found no significant difference in infant allergy (four studies, 2156 infants; typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.08) or childhood allergy incidence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73, 1.14). No eligible trial examined the effect of prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. There is evidence that preterm or low birthweight infants fed a hydrolysed preterm formula have significantly reduced weight gain, but not in other growth parameters (head circumference or length). Studies in term infants report no adverse effects on growth. Subgroup analysis of trials of partially hydrolysed versus cow's milk formula found a significant reduction in infant allergy (six studies, 1391 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) but not childhood allergy, or infant or childhood asthma, eczema or rhinitis. Methodological concerns were the same as for the overall analysis. Analysis of trials of extensively hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula found no significant differences in allergy or food intolerance. Infants fed extensively hydrolysed formula compared with partially hydrolysed formula had a significant reduction in food allergy (two studies, 341 infants; typical RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19, 0.99), but there was no significant difference in all allergy or any other specific allergy incidence. Comparing extensively hydrolysed casein containing formula with cow's milk formula, one study (431 infants) reported a significant reduction in childhood allergy incidence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53, 0.97). Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (three studies, 1237 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51, 0.97). One study reported a significant reduction in childhood eczema incidence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44, 0.98) and prevalence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.92). There is no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of allergy compared to exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed, there is limited evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA. In view of methodological concerns and inconsistency of findings, further large, well designed trials comparing formulas containing partially hydrolysed whey, or extensively hydrolysed casein to cow's milk formulas are needed.
Summary 1: Studies have not found a significant difference among these forms of milk for infants without a strong family history of atopic disease.

Query 2: Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later?
Document 2: The natural history of allergic disease and its potential for prevention merit close examination because of the explosive worldwide increase in the prevalence and morbidity of atopic disorders. This study examines the development of atopy at age 7 years in 165 children in a high-risk cohort, previously reported from birth to age 4 years. In this prospective, randomized, controlled study of food allergen avoidance in infancy, the prophylactic-treated group consisted of infants whose mothers avoided cow's milk, egg, and peanut during the last trimester of pregnancy and lactation and who, themselves, avoided cow's milk until age 1 year (casein hydrolysate supplementation before age 1), egg until age 2 years, and peanut and fish until age 3 years. The control group consisted of maternal/infant pairs who followed standard feeding practices. Despite a significant reduction in food allergy and milk sensitization before age 2 years, none of the following differed between the groups at age 7 years: food allergy, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, any atopic disease, lung function, food or aeroallergen sensitization, serum IgE level, or presence of nasal eosinophils or nasal basophilic cells. Children with food allergy by 4 years evidenced higher 7-year (current) prevalences of allergic rhinitis and asthma (p < 0.01). Atopic diseases/parameters at age 7 years were shown, by multivariate analysis (p < 0.05), to be associated with several genetic and environmental risk factors (male gender, maternal nonwhite ethnicity and asthma, and household smoking), as well as predictive atopic markers during infancy (elevated serum IgE level; egg, cow's milk, and peanut sensitization; and nasal eosinophils and nasal basophilic cells). These findings help to: (1) elucidate the natural history of atopic disease in high-risk children; (2) document the progression of allergy from atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and food sensitization to respiratory allergy and aeroallergen sensitization despite food allergy prevention in infancy; (3) identify allergy predictive markers; and (4) expand our appreciation of the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in the development of atopy.
Summary 2: A study randomized 165 high-risk children into groups with standard feeding practices or an allergy prophylaxis regimen, which included avoidance of milk protein until age 1 year, eggs until 2 years, and fish and peanuts until 3 years. Although prophylaxis decreased the prevalence of atopic disorders at 1 year, there was no difference in any atopic disease between the 2 groups at age 7.

Query: Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later?
Document: In infants with a family history of atopy, food allergen avoidance has been advocated as means of preventing the development of atopic disease when breast-feeding is not possible or supplemental feeding is needed. Most infant formulas are based on cow's milk protein. Alternative choices include soya based and hydrolysed cows milk formulas. To estimate the effect of dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein on the development of asthma or wheeze in children. The Cochrane database was searched for eligible trials until February 2002. The full text papers of all abstracts identified as RCTs were obtained and reviewed independently by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials involving children with a family history of atopy in at least one first degree relative were considered if feeding with cow's milk based standard formula was compared to dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein using soya or other hypoallergenic formula during the initial four months of life or longer. Two reviewers extracted data independently. A priori defined subgroups were the types of hypoallergenic artificial feed and dietary restrictions on mother and/or child's diet. Six trials used hydrolysed formula for at least 4 months in addition to dietary restrictions and in some cases dust-mite reduction measures. The risk of infants experiencing asthma or wheeze during the first year of life was reduced compared to standard cow's milk based formula (Relative Risk =0.40, 95% Confidence Intervals 0.19, 0.85). Feeding soya-based formula as opposed to standard cow's milk formula did not reduce the risk of having asthma or wheeze at any age. Breast-milk should remain the feed of choice for all babies. In infants with at least one first degree relative with atopy, hydrolysed formula for a minimum of 4 months combined with dietary restrictions and environment measures may reduce the risk of developing asthma or wheeze in the first year of life. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that soya-based milk formula has any benefit.
Summary:",The relative risk for wheeze or asthma in the first year of life was 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.85) for children fed hydrolyzed protein formulas when compared with cow's milk.

Query 1: Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 1: Initial treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, little is known about their relative or combined effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of 4 treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder. Randomized controlled trial of a volunteer sample of 439 patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years with a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The trial was conducted at 13 US academic and community clinics between spring 2000 and summer 2003. Twelve weeks of (1) fluoxetine alone (10 to 40 mg/d), (2) CBT alone, (3) CBT with fluoxetine (10 to 40 mg/d), or (4) placebo (equivalent to 10 to 40 mg/d). Placebo and fluoxetine alone were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and, for responder analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions improvement score. Compared with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with CBT was statistically significant (P =.001) on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P =.02) and CBT alone (P =.01), treatment of fluoxetine with CBT was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to CBT alone (P =.01). Rates of response for fluoxetine with CBT were 71.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-80%); fluoxetine alone, 60.6% (95% CI, 51%-70%); CBT alone, 43.2% (95% CI, 34%-52%); and placebo, 34.8% (95% CI, 26%-44%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior to CBT and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with CBT showed the greatest reduction (P =.02). Seven (1.6%) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides. The combination of fluoxetine with CBT offered the most favorable tradeoff between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.
Summary 1: The landmark Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study, which was included in the meta-analysis, comprised 4 treatment arms: fluoxetine alone, cognitive-behavioral treatment alone, fluoxetine with CBT, and placebo. Only the combination therapy group showed a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the primary outcome (improved Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised). Improvement in the Clinical Global Impressions score, a subjective measure, was statistically significant in 71% of patients receiving combination therapy and 60.6% of those treated with fluoxetine compared with placebo (34.8%) or cognitive-behavioral treatment alone (43.2%).

Query 2: Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 2: The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) are well established. Comparatively few data are available on the effects of SSRIs in depressed children and adolescents. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sertraline compared with placebo in treatment of pediatric patients with MDD. Two multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted at 53 hospital, general practice, and academic centers in the United States, India, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico between December 1999 and May 2001 and were pooled a priori. Three hundred seventy-six children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-defined MDD of at least moderate severity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a flexible dosage (50-200 mg/d) of sertraline (n = 189) or matching placebo tablets (n = 187) for 10 weeks. Change from baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) Best Description of Child total score and reported adverse events. Sertraline-treated patients experienced statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the CDRS-R total score (mean change at week 10, -30.24 vs -25.83, respectively; P =.001; overall mean change, -22.84 vs -20.19, respectively; P =.007). Based on a 40% decrease in the adjusted CDRS-R total score at study end point, 69% of sertraline-treated patients compared with 59% of placebo patients were considered responders (P =.05). Sertraline treatment was generally well tolerated. Seventeen sertraline-treated patients (9%) and 5 placebo patients (3%) prematurely discontinued the study because of adverse events. Adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of sertraline-treated patients and with an incidence of at least twice that in placebo patients included diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and agitation. The results of this pooled analysis demonstrate that sertraline is an effective and well-tolerated short-term treatment for children and adolescents with MDD.
Summary 2: Two RCTs showed that sertraline was slightly, but statistically significantly, better than placebo when the 2 identically designed trials were combined.

Query 1: Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents?
Document 1: There has been concern that widely used antidepressant agents might be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) in pediatric patients. To investigate the relationship between antidepressant drugs and suicidality in pediatric patients participating in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Data were derived from 23 trials conducted in 9 drug company-supported programs evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric patients and 1 multicenter trial (the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study) that evaluated fluoxetine hydrochloride. All placebo-controlled trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration were eligible for inclusion. Evaluable data were derived from 4582 patients in 24 trials. Sixteen trials studied patients with major depressive disorder, and the remaining 8 studied obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 4), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), and social anxiety disorder (n = 1). Only 20 trials were included in the risk ratio analysis of suicidality because 4 trials had no events in the drug or placebo groups. Individual patient data were available for all the trials. A meta-analysis was conducted to obtain overall suicidality risk estimates for each drug individually, for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials as a group, and for all evaluable trials combined. There were no completed suicides in any of these trials. The multicenter trial was the only individual trial to show a statistically significant risk ratio (4.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-20.92). The overall risk ratio for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.02-2.68) and for all drugs across all indications was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.28-2.98). The overall risk difference for all drugs across all indications was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03). Use of antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients is associated with a modestly increased risk of suicidality.
Summary 1: A recent study that incorporated the food and drug administration meta-analysis analyzed data from 4582 patients. Although no completed suicides were reported in any trial, the drug-treated groups had a two-fold in-crease in suicidality compared with placebo groups (4% vs 2%; number needed to harm [NNH]=50).

Document 2: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders. PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial. Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.
Summary 2: Pooled results of 3 RCTs demonstrated that paroxetine was no better than placebo. Two RCTs of citalopram and 1 randomized controlled trials of escitalopram showed marginally significant benefit over placebo only when pooled.

Query: Should we use SSRIs to treat adolescents with depression?
Document: There has been concern that widely used antidepressant agents might be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) in pediatric patients. To investigate the relationship between antidepressant drugs and suicidality in pediatric patients participating in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Data were derived from 23 trials conducted in 9 drug company-supported programs evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric patients and 1 multicenter trial (the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study) that evaluated fluoxetine hydrochloride. All placebo-controlled trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration were eligible for inclusion. Evaluable data were derived from 4582 patients in 24 trials. Sixteen trials studied patients with major depressive disorder, and the remaining 8 studied obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 4), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), and social anxiety disorder (n = 1). Only 20 trials were included in the risk ratio analysis of suicidality because 4 trials had no events in the drug or placebo groups. Individual patient data were available for all the trials. A meta-analysis was conducted to obtain overall suicidality risk estimates for each drug individually, for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials as a group, and for all evaluable trials combined. There were no completed suicides in any of these trials. The multicenter trial was the only individual trial to show a statistically significant risk ratio (4.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-20.92). The overall risk ratio for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.02-2.68) and for all drugs across all indications was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.28-2.98). The overall risk difference for all drugs across all indications was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03). Use of antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients is associated with a modestly increased risk of suicidality.
Summary:","In 2004, the FDA conducted a meta-analysis of the suicide related adverse events from the published and unpublished trials of SSRIs including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine (Luvox), and citalopram. A team of experts reviewed the adverse events from each trial to evaluate for suicidality including suicidal ideation, preparatory acts, self-injurious behavior, or suicide attempts. They found a risk ratio of 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.68) for suicidality in the treatment arms compared with placebo. There were no completed suicides in any study."

Query 1: What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes?
Document 1: This study was undertaken to compare the use of glyburide with insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) unresponsive to diet therapy. A retrospective study was performed among women with singleton pregnancies who had GDM diagnosed, with fasting plasma glucose 140 mg/dL or less on glucose tolerance testing, between 12 and 34 weeks who failed diet therapy from 1999 to 2002. We identified 584 women and compared those treated with insulin between 1999 and 2000 with women treated with glyburide between 2001 and 2002. Maternal and neonatal outcomes and complications were assessed. Statistical methods included univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression. In 1999 through 2000, 268 women had GDM diagnosed and were treated with insulin; in 2001 through 2002, 316 women had GDM diagnosed of which 236 (75%) received glyburide. The 2 groups were similar with regard to age, nulliparity, and historical GDM risk factors; however, women in the insulin group had a higher mean body mass index (31.9 vs 30.6 kg/m 2 , P=.04), a greater proportion identified themselves as white (43%, 28%, P<.001) and fewer as Asian (24%, 37%, P=.001), and they had a significantly higher mean fasting on glucose tolerance test (105.4 vs 102.4 mg/dL , P=.005) compared with the glyburide group. There were no significant differences in birth weight (3599+/-650 g vs 3661+/-629 g, P=.3), macrosomia (24%, 25%, P=.7), or cesarean delivery (35%, 39 %, P=.4). Women in the glyburide group had a higher incidence of preeclampsia (12%, 6%, P=.02), and neonates in the glyburide group were more likely to receive phototherapy (9%, 5%, P<.05), and less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (15%, 24%, P=.008) though they had a longer NICU length of stay (4.3+/-9.6 vs 8.0+/-10.1, P=.002). Posttreatment glycemic control data were available for 122 women treated with insulin and 137 women treated with glyburide. More women in the glyburide group achieved mean fasting and postprandial goals (86%, 63%, P<.001). These findings remained significant in logistic regression analysis. In a large managed care organization, glyburide was at least as effective as insulin in achieving glycemic control and similar birth weights in women with GDM who failed diet therapy. The increased risk of preeclampsia and phototherapy in the glyburide group warrant further study.
Summary 1: Similarly, a retrospective study comparing glyburide with insulin in 584 women found little difference between the 2 approaches. Women in the glyburide group had better glycemic control, but the women in the insulin group started with higher initial blood sugars. The glyburide group had fewer neonatal intensive care unit admissions than the insulin group (number needed to treat [NNT]=11), but higher rates of jaundice (number needed to harm [NNH]=25), pre-eclampsia (NNH=17), and maternal hypoglycemia (NNH=8). All other neonatal outcomes were similar between groups.

Query 2: What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes?
Document 2: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether treatment of women with gestational diabetes mellitus reduced the risk of perinatal complications. We randomly assigned women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation who had gestational diabetes to receive dietary advice, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin therapy as needed (the intervention group) or routine care. Primary outcomes included serious perinatal complications (defined as death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and nerve palsy), admission to the neonatal nursery, jaundice requiring phototherapy, induction of labor, cesarean birth, and maternal anxiety, depression, and health status. The rate of serious perinatal complications was significantly lower among the infants of the 490 women in the intervention group than among the infants of the 510 women in the routine-care group (1 percent vs. 4 percent; relative risk adjusted for maternal age, race or ethnic group, and parity, 0.33; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.75; P=0.01). However, more infants of women in the intervention group were admitted to the neonatal nursery (71 percent vs. 61 percent; adjusted relative risk, 1.13; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.23; P=0.01). Women in the intervention group had a higher rate of induction of labor than the women in the routine-care group (39 percent vs. 29 percent; adjusted relative risk, 1.36; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.62; P<0.001), although the rates of cesarean delivery were similar (31 percent and 32 percent, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 0.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.16; P=0.73). At three months post partum, data on the women's mood and quality of life, available for 573 women, revealed lower rates of depression and higher scores, consistent with improved health status, in the intervention group. Treatment of gestational diabetes reduces serious perinatal morbidity and may also improve the woman's health-related quality of life.
Summary 2: One study found a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit admission in the treatment group, but the authors attributed this to physician awareness of the patient having gestational diabetes.

Query: What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes?
Document: Women with gestational diabetes mellitus are rarely treated with a sulfonylurea drug, because of concern about teratogenicity and neonatal hypoglycemia. There is little information about the efficacy of these drugs in this group of women. We studied 404 women with singleton pregnancies and gestational diabetes that required treatment. The women were randomly assigned between 11 and 33 weeks of gestation to receive glyburide or insulin according to an intensified treatment protocol. The primary end point was achievement of the desired level of glycemic control. Secondary end points included maternal and neonatal complications. The mean (+/-SD) pretreatment blood glucose concentration as measured at home for one week was 114+/-19 mg per deciliter (6.4+/-1.1 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 116+/-22 mg per deciliter (6.5+/-1.2 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.33). The mean concentrations during treatment were 105+/-16 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-0.9 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 105+/-18 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-1.0 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.99). Eight women in the glyburide group (4 percent) required insulin therapy. There were no significant differences between the glyburide and insulin groups in the percentage of infants who were large for gestational age (12 percent and 13 percent, respectively); who had macrosomia, defined as a birth weight of 4000 g or more (7 percent and 4 percent); who had lung complications (8 percent and 6 percent); who had hypoglycemia (9 percent and 6 percent); who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (6 percent and 7 percent); or who had fetal anomalies (2 percent and 2 percent). The cord-serum insulin concentrations were similar in the two groups, and glyburide was not detected in the cord serum of any infant in the glyburide group. In women with gestational diabetes, glyburide is a clinically effective alternative to insulin therapy.
Summary:","A high-quality randomized controlled trial comparing glyburide with insulin among 404 women found no difference in maternal hypoglycemia, neonatal mortality, or neonatal features and outcomes (including birthweight, NICU admissions, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoglycemia; P ≥.25). Although this was a fairly large trial, it may have been underpowered since it found small differences in such rare outcomes."

Query 1: What is the best workup for hypocalcemia?
Document 1: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was evaluated in a population of elderly institutionalized subjects in seven long-term geriatric care facilities in France (Amiens, Francheville, Ivry, Lille, Montpellier, Oissel and Villejuif). Residents whose functional capability was relatively good were entered into the study. There were 126 patients (99 females and 27 males) with a mean age +/- SD of 84 +/- 6.6 years. All subjects had been institutionalized for over six months and were capable of walking at least as far as the dining room. None had received vitamin D or other compounds known to affect the metabolism of phosphorus and calcium within six months before the study. Vitamin D status was evaluated by determining serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH D) levels using a radiocompetition assay after extraction and chromatographic separation. Mean serum 25 OH D was 3.17 +/- 2.52 ng/ml (median 2.5). Eighty-five per cent of subjects had serum 25 OH D values of less than 5 ng/ml and 98% had values under 10 ng/ml, which is the cutoff usually taken to define vitamin D deficiency. Mean serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone were increased approximately two-fold as compared with values in healthy adults (70 +/- 39 pg/ml versus 33 +/- 12 pg/ml). Biochemical markers for bone formation (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and bone resorption (TRAP, hydroxyproline, pyridinoline) were all increased, with mean values 1.4-fold to 3.4-fold those seen in healthy adults. Serum 25 OH D levels were negatively correlated with serum intact parathyroid hormone levels (r = 0.41; p < 0.0001). Serum intact parathyroid hormone levels were positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity (r = 0.30; p < 0.001) and serum osteocalcin levels (r = 0.36; p < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with corrected serum calcium levels (r = -0.20; p < 0.02). Conclusion. Our data demonstrate that severe vitamin D deficiency is present in virtually all elderly institutionalized subjects and is accompanied with secondary hyperparathyroidism responsible for increases in markers of bone remodeling. Routine vitamin D supplementation is warranted in elderly institutionalized subjects.
Summary 1: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/mL of 25-OH vitamin D) is and 95% in institutionalized elderly patients.

Query 2: Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness?
Document 2: To determine whether antipyretic therapy prolongs the course of experimental influenza A, Shigella sonnei, and Rickettsia rickettsii infections. Retrospective observational study. University Center for Vaccine Development. Fifty-four volunteers with experimentally induced influenza A, 45 with S. sonnei, and 21 with R. rickettsii infections participated. Subjects from the six influenza A studies were challenged intranasally. If they met certain criteria, they were offered aspirin or acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Subjects from the three Shigella studies were challenged with the bacteria and then given trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Acetaminophen also could be administered. In the one R. rickettsii trial, subjects were inoculated intradermally and treated with tetracycline. Again, acetaminophen was administered for symptomatic relief. Data, excerpted from subjects' study records, were evaluated using Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Two-tailed hypotheses with a p value of 0.05 were used for all of the analyses. There was a striking correlation between antipyretic therapy and duration of illness in subjects infected with influenza A and S. sonnei, but not R. rickettsii. Multivariate analysis suggested that antipyretic therapy prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A, but its use was the result of prolonged illness in those infected with S. sonnei. The precise nature of these relationships requires a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
Summary 2: In a retrospective observational study of 54 volunteers, antipyretics were associated with a trend towards prolonged duration of illness in a group of 21 patients infected with S sonnei (4.6 ± 2.1 days with antipyretics vs 1.9 ± 1.6 days without; P=not significant).

Query: Should we use appetite stimulants for malnourished elderly patients?
Document: To provide preliminary evidence on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of megestrol acetate for older persons with impaired appetite after hospitalization. Randomized clinical trial. Acute care hospital. Forty-seven older persons (mean age 83) who were recently discharged from an acute care hospital and had fair or poor appetite. Participants were randomized to placebo or megestrol acetate suspension 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily for 9 weeks. Appetite, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects were measured at baseline and 20, 42, and 63 days. Serum nutritional markers were measured at baseline and 20 and 63 days. During the course of the study, there were no significant differences between treatment groups on any of the appetite questions, although participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline on some questions. At 20 days, prealbumin increased in a dose-response relationship across the four groups (by 0.4, 5.1, 7.5, and 9.0 mg/dL, respectively). Participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups demonstrated greater improvement in prealbumin levels at 20 days than those receiving placebo (P=.009 and P=.004, respectively) and those in the 400-mg group also demonstrated improvement at 63 days (P=.02). At 20 days, no participant taking placebo had a morning serum cortisol level less than 8 ng/mL (the lower limit of normal). In contrast, 33%, 70%, and 78% of those taking 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg, respectively, had values below this level; by 63 days, these percentages were 11%, 30%, 56%, and 37%, respectively. No patient reported clinical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Diarrhea developed in three subjects, and thromboembolism occurred in two receiving active treatment. Megestrol acetate at doses of 400 mg and 800 mg increases prealbumin in recently hospitalized older persons. Cortisol suppression is common at higher doses and may be persistent. In this small study, the drug did not confer benefit on other nutritional or clinical outcomes.
Summary:","One placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial studied 45 malnourished patients who were recently discharged from an acute care hospital to a nursing home. The patients (predominately female, with a mean age of 83) were randomized into 4 treatment arms (placebo or megestrol 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily) and followed for 63 days. Only those receiving megestrol (400 mg or 800 mg daily) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in patient appetite and a dose-responsive increase in prealbumin level at the 20 day interim analysis (7.5 and 9.0 mg/dL, respectfully). But at the final assessment (63 days), only the 400-mg dose maintained a statistically significant increase in prealbumin over placebo. However, there was no significant improvement in serum albumin or clinical endpoints (weight, functional status, or health-related quality of life)."

Query 1: What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis?
Document 1: Novel commercial kits based on antibody reactivity to purified heterophile antigens have recently been introduced for the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-associated infectious mononucleosis (IM). It is important to determine possible improvements in the performance and reliability of such tests for the diagnosis of IM. To evaluate the reliability of six commercially available kits for the rapid diagnosis of IM in comparison to EB-virus-specific serology. In total, 100 sera, 53 from patients with serologically verified primary EB virus infection and 47 from EB-virus-immune or -susceptible patients, were used to evaluate the six rapid test kits: Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex (latex agglutination-based kits), Mono-Plus, IM-Check and Clearview IM (solid-phase-based kits). EB-virus-specific serologies including detection of viral capsid antigen IgM and IgG and EB nuclear antigen-1 IgG, were used as reference methods. Compared with the reference methods, the sensitivities and specificities of the heterophile antibody test kits were 70-92% and 96-100%, respectively. IM-Check had a low sensitivity and was difficult to read. The remaining kits performed well. Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex, Mono-Plus and Clearview IM can be recommended for the confirmation of EB-virus-associated infectious mononucleosis. Clearview IM combined a high sensitivity and specificity with very simple one-step solid-phase-based procedure.
Summary 1: A validating cohort study validating cohort studies assessed the accuracy of several commercially available test kits for the detection of heterophile antibodies (eg, ""Mono spot"" tests). The study compared 6 kits using either a latex agglutination or a solid-phase assay against a ""gold standard"" of serologic verification for 53 serum samples from primary epstein-barr virus infection, 26 samples from epstein-barr virus immune patients, and 21 samples from healthy donors. Serologic verification used immunoflourescence to determine: the absence of IgG but presence of IgM, the presence of IgG but absence of IgM, or the absence of both antibodies (respectively) against EBVCA.

Query 2: What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis?
Document 2: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis is often diagnosed based on characteristic clinical features and either a positive heterophil antibody test or serology, both of which can be unreliable in young children. Real time quantitative PCR assays that measure EBV DNA load in serum or plasma are highly sensitive in young children, but serum and plasma contain inhibitors of PCR which must be removed by DNA extraction techniques. A real time TaqMan PCR assay was designed and evaluated for simultaneously measuring EBV DNA load and validating the removal of PCR inhibitors from serum samples. A serum sample was available from patients classified serologically as primary EBV infection (n = 28), EBV-seronegative (n = 25) and EBV-seropositive (n = 26). Patients were classified as having EBV infectious mononucleosis if they had specified clinical findings and > or =10% atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood or had a positive Monospot test result. DNA was purified by a spin column method and tested in PCR reactions with primers for EBV DNA polymerase gene and internal control targets. Amplification of the two PCR products was measured in real time with separate TaqMan DNA probes labeled with various fluorescent reporters. The mean age of study patients was 9 years, 4 months. Twenty-one (75%) of the patients in the primary EBV infection group, one (4%) of the seronegatives and none of the seropositives had detectable EBV DNA. Within the primary infection group, those with detectable virus were more likely than those without detectable virus to have evidence of lymphadenopathy (14 of 16 vs.1 of 5; P = 0.011), higher mean atypical (11.7 vs.0.9%; P = 0.002) and absolute atypical (1.5 vs.0.1 x 109/l; P = 0.004) lymphocyte count, higher mean absolute lymphocyte count (4.7 vs.2.3 x 109/l; P = 0.026) and higher mean aspartate aminotransferase value (119.8 vs.37.3 IU/l; P = 0.036). Ten patients, all in the primary infection group, had EBV infectious mononucleosis, and all had positive PCR results. No sample contained PCR inhibitors. A real time TaqMan PCR assay allows rapid identification of patients with primary EBV infection and those with EBV infectious mononucleosis.
Summary 2: Another validating cohort study evaluated PCR testing for epstein-barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid among children (average age 9 years, 4 months), 28 with infectious mononucleosis, 25 who were epstein-barr virus seronegative, and 26 who were seropositive. Children with acute infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed by symptoms, >10% atypical lymphocytes, and a positive heterophile antibody test. The PCR found a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 98% at 1 week. Testing earlier, especially in children, is expected to decrease the sensitivity due to the lower maturity of the immune system response.

Query: What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis?
Document: Ten microbiological departments in Norway have participated in a multicenter evaluation of the following commercial tests for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific and heterophile antibodies: CAPTIA Select viral capsid antigen (VCA)-M/G/EBNA (Centocor Inc.), Enzygnost anti-EBV/immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG (Dade Behring), Vironostika EBV VCA IgM/IgG/EBNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Organon Teknika), SEROFLUOR immunofluorescence assay and EBV Combi-Test (Institute Virion Ltd.), anti-EBV recombinant IgM- and IgG-early antigen/EBNA IgG ELISA (Biotest Diagnostics), EBV IgM/IgG/EBNA ELISA (Gull Laboratories), Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur), Monosticon Dri-Dot (Organon Teknika), Avitex-IM (Omega Diagnostics Ltd.), Alexon Serascan infectious mononucleosis test (Alexon Biomedical Inc. ), Clearview IM (Unipath Ltd.), and Cards+/-OS Mono (Pacific Biotech, Inc.). The test panel included sera from patients with primary EBV infection, immunocompromised patients with recent cytomegalovirus infection, healthy persons (blood donors), and EBV-seronegative persons. Among the tests for EBV-specific antibodies the sensitivity was good, with only small differences between the different assays. However, there was a greater variation in specificity, which varied between 100% (Enzygnost) and 86% (Biotest). Tests for detection of heterophile antibodies based on purified or selected antigen (Avitex, Alexon, Clearview IM, and Cards+/-OS Mono) were more sensitive than the Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn and Monosticon tests.
Summary:",A validating cohort study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of 6 commercial test kits for detection of Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibodies (EBVCA and EBNA). The study compared antibody levels in 139 serum specimens from patients with recent primary EBV infections (confirmed by both a positive heterophile antibody test and an EBV antibody pattern compatible with recent infection) and in 40 specimens from healthy normal controls. The average sensitivity of the antibody tests was 97% (95%-99%) and average specificity was 94% (86%-100%).

Within the primary infection group, those with detectable virus were more likely than those without detectable virus to have evidence of lymphadenopathy (14 of 16 vs.1 of 5; P = 0.011), higher mean atypical (11.7 vs.0.9%; P = 0.002) and absolute atypical (1.5 vs.0.1 x 109/l; P = 0.004) lymphocyte count, higher mean absolute lymphocyte count (4.7 vs.2.3 x 109/l; P = 0.026) and higher mean aspartate aminotransferase value (119.8 vs.37.3 IU/l; P = 0.036). Ten patients, all in the primary infection group, had EBV infectious mononucleosis, and all had positive PCR results. No sample contained PCR inhibitors. A real time TaqMan PCR assay allows rapid identification of patients with primary EBV infection and those with EBV infectious mononucleosis.
Summary 2: Another validating cohort study evaluated PCR testing for epstein-barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid among children (average age 9 years, 4 months), 28 with infectious mononucleosis, 25 who were epstein-barr virus seronegative, and 26 who were seropositive. Children with acute infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed by symptoms, >10% atypical lymphocytes, and a positive heterophile antibody test. The PCR found a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 98% at 1 week. Testing earlier, especially in children, is expected to decrease the sensitivity due to the lower maturity of the immune system response.

Query: What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis?
Document: Ten microbiological departments in Norway have participated in a multicenter evaluation of the following commercial tests for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific and heterophile antibodies: CAPTIA Select viral capsid antigen (VCA)-M/G/EBNA (Centocor Inc.), Enzygnost anti-EBV/immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG (Dade Behring), Vironostika EBV VCA IgM/IgG/EBNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Organon Teknika), SEROFLUOR immunofluorescence assay and EBV Combi-Test (Institute Virion Ltd.), anti-EBV recombinant IgM- and IgG-early antigen/EBNA IgG ELISA (Biotest Diagnostics), EBV IgM/IgG/EBNA ELISA (Gull Laboratories), Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur), Monosticon Dri-Dot (Organon Teknika), Avitex-IM (Omega Diagnostics Ltd.), Alexon Serascan infectious mononucleosis test (Alexon Biomedical Inc. ), Clearview IM (Unipath Ltd.), and Cards+/-OS Mono (Pacific Biotech, Inc.). The test panel included sera from patients with primary EBV infection, immunocompromised patients with recent cytomegalovirus infection, healthy persons (blood donors), and EBV-seronegative persons. Among the tests for EBV-specific antibodies the sensitivity was good, with only small differences between the different assays. However, there was a greater variation in specificity, which varied between 100% (Enzygnost) and 86% (Biotest). Tests for detection of heterophile antibodies based on purified or selected antigen (Avitex, Alexon, Clearview IM, and Cards+/-OS Mono) were more sensitive than the Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn and Monosticon tests.
Summary:",The second study used a similar method to test 6 more heterophile kits using blood samples from 140 patients.

Query 1: Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile?
Document 1: Screening children for asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis and renal scarring is widely recommended, but its cost-effectiveness has not been established. We reviewed published studies to determine the costs and benefits of screening toilet-trained, asymptomatic children for bacteriuria. Given the sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods (approximately 80% each) and the prevalence of bacteriuria in asymptomatic children (approximately 1% in girls and 0.03% in boys), screening 100,000 children would result in 19,897 (20%) false-positive tests; initial screening and two urine cultures to confirm the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria would miss 28% of 515 children with true bacteriuria, and cost nearly $2.9 million. There is no evidence that detection and treatment of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria prevents subsequent pyelonephritis or renal scarring. Screening for bacteriuria in asymptomatic children is costly, fails to prevent pyelonephritis or renal scarring, and should be discontinued as a part of routine well-child care.
Summary 1: Expert opinion varies as to the necessity of screening urinalysis. No prospective randomized trials demonstrate improved outcomes, and limited evidence suggests that detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria improves long-term outcomes such as renal scarring, hypertension, or pyelone phritis.

Query 2: Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer?
Document 2: Breast self-examination and clinical breast examination have been promoted for many years as general screening methods to diagnose breast cancer at an earlier stage in order to decrease morbidity and or mortality. The possible benefits and harms remain unclear. To determine whether screening for breast cancer by regular self-examination or clinical breast examination reduces breast cancer mortality and morbidity. The Cochrane Library and Medline were searched for randomised trials; date of last search October 2002. The specialised register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched. Randomised clinical trials, including cluster randomised trials. Decisions on which trials to include were taken independently by the reviewers based on the methods of trial. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Intention to treat analyses were conducted using a fixed effect model with 95% confidence intervals. Two large population-based studies (388,535 women) from Russia and Shanghai that compared breast self-examination with no intervention were included. There was no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality, relative risk 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.24) (587 deaths in total). In Russia, more cancers were found in the breast self-examination group than in the control group (relative risk 1.24, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.41), while this was not the case in Shanghai (relative risk 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06). Almost twice as many biopsies (3406) with benign results were performed in the screening group compared to the control group (1856), relative risk 1.89, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.00. Data from two large trials do not suggest a beneficial effect of screening by breast self-examination whereas there is evidence for harms. There were no randomised trials of clinical breast examination. At present, breast self-examination cannot be recommended.
Summary 2: Two large RCTs, conducted in St Petersburg, Russia (122,471 women) and Shanghai, China (266,064 women), were found. Both studies used cluster randomization (by worksite) and involved large numbers of women who were meticulously trained in proper breast self-examination technique and had numerousreinforcement sessions. Study compliance and follow-up were excellent. Outcomes assessment was explicitly blinded in the Shanghai study. Neither trial demonstrated a reduction in breast cancer mortality or improvement in the number or stage of cancers detected during 9 to 11 years of follow-up, but there is evidence for harm: a nearly 2-fold increase in false-positive results, physician visits, and biopsies for benign disease.

Query: What are appropriate screening tests for infants and children?
Document: Amblyopia is a reversible deficit of vision that has to be treated within the sensitive period for visual development. Screening programmes have been set up to detect this largely asymptomatic condition and refer children for treatment while an improvement in vision is still possible. The value of such programmes and the optimum protocol for administering them remain controversial. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of vision screening in reducing the prevalence of amblyopia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, on The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2005 week 1) and EMBASE (1980 to 2005 week 19). No language restrictions were placed on these searches. No handsearching was done. We planned to analyse data from randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials comparing the prevalence of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations. Two authors independently assessed study abstracts identified by the electronic searches. Full text copies of appropriate studies were obtained and, where necessary, authors were contacted. No data were available for analysis and no meta-analysis was performed. Despite the large amount of literature available regarding vision screening no trials designed to compare the prevalence of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations were found. Data currently under preparation may be available for updates to the review. The lack of data from randomised controlled trials makes it difficult to analyse the impact of existing screening programmes on the prevalence of amblyopia. The absence of such evidence cannot be taken to mean that vision screening is not beneficial; simply that this intervention has not yet been tested in robust trials. To facilitate such trials normative data on age-appropriate vision tests need to be available and a consensus reached regarding the definition of amblyopia. In addition, the consequences of living with untreated amblyopia have yet to be quantified and a cost-benefit analysis carried out.
Summary:",One fair-quality controlled study (N=3490) showed a decreased prevalence of amblyopia in the screened group and evidence that treatment of amblyotic risk factors prevents amblyopia.

Query 1: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document 1: To review recent evidence on dietary factors associated with diverticular disease (DD) with special emphasis on dietary fibre. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles on the relationship between dietary and other lifestyle factors and DD. Most articles either focused on dietary intervention in treating symptomatic DD or were case-control studies with inherent limitations for studying diet-disease associations. Only one large prospective study of male health professionals in the United States assessed diet at baseline and before initial diagnosis of DD. A diet high in fibre mainly from fruits and vegetables and low in total fat and red meat decreases risk of DD. Evidence indicates that the insoluble component of fibre is strongly associated with lower risk of DD; this association was particularly strong for cellulose. Caffeine and alcohol do not substantially increase risk of DD, nor does obesity, but higher levels of physical activity seem to reduce risk of DD. A diet high in fibre and low in total fat and red meat and a lifestyle with more physical activity might help prevent DD.
Summary 1: Because of strong epidemiological evidence that people from cultures with high-fiber diets are far less likely to develop diverticulosis than are people who live in cultures of low-fiber diets, it has been assumed that a diet high in fiber can prevent diverticulosis. Many small, uncontrolled studies have also investigated the effect of high-fiber diets and supplements on symptoms of diverticulosis and prevention of diverticulitis episodes.

Query 2: How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis?
Document 2: Diverticula (mucosal outpouching through the wall of the colon) affect over 5% of adults aged 40 years and older, but only 10-25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: treatments for uncomplicated diverticular disease; treatments to prevent complications; and treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodics, bran, elective surgery, increasing fibre intake, ispaghula husk, lactulose, medical treatment, mesalazine, methylcellulose, rifaximin, surgery.
Summary 2: A 2007 systematic review found 1 randomized controlled trials of the anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine (mesalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid) for preventing diverticulitis. Mesalamine reduced the recurrence rate of diverticulitis from 46% to 15% among 166 subjects. The reviewers judged the study to be flawed by unreported diagnostic criteria and a high withdrawal rate. They concluded that the effectiveness of mesalamine remains unknown.

Query: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document: Epidemiological and anatomic evidence indicates that approximately 60% of humans of westernized societies living into the sixth decade will develop diverticulosis of the colon. The cause remains unknown, but epidemiological studies indicate it is a combination of decreased dietary fiber intake and increased intracolonic pressure. The intraluminal pressure exerted on the wall causes a diverticular outpocketing at any one of the three areas in which vessels enter the wall. In this paper, we advance a hypothesis that fiber deficiency not only leads to diverticula formation but also causes a change in the microecology that results in decreased colon immune response and permits a low-grade chronic inflammatory process that precedes a full-blown acute diverticulitis. Pathophysiologic studies reveal that complications do not occur until there is microperforation through the wall of the diverticulum into the pericolic tissue. The perforation might be small and cause a microabscess, or extend to a phlegmon, or extend to a large abscess formation. Free perforation occurs rarely, but fistulization does occur and most commonly to the bladder. The clinical findings vary. Most often, the clinical picture is one of fever, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habit, and localizing findings associated with leukocytosis. Computerized tomography scanning has become the procedure of choice to evaluate the symptoms since it is of less risk than a barium enema and obtains more information. The differential diagnosis may be difficult but usually can be made with accuracy. Medical treatment is preferred with appropriate antibiotic therapy and variations in fiber intake. When abscess occurs, percutaneous drainage may be tried, but when it is unsuccessful, surgical intervention is necessary. Sudden hemorrhage from a vessel in diverticula may also occur. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all patients that develop diverticula will have either inflammatory or bleeding episodes. In conclusion, fiber deficiency results in diverticular formation and a chronic inflammation that may progress to acute or chronic diverticulitis that can be treated medically but may require surgical intervention.
Summary:","Approximately 60% of people living in Westernized countries who are older than 60 years will develop diverticulosis of the colon. Colonic diverticuli are thought to develop from an increase in intraluminal pressure. This pressure can be caused by colonic motility abnormalities, but a low-fiber diet can also result in a smaller stool mass and a less distended colon, thereby increasing intraluminal pressure."

Query 1: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document 1: Three treatments for patients with symptomatic diverticular disease were compared in a crossover trial. Neither a high-roughage diet (HRD) nor Normacol plus an antispasmodic were as effective as bran tablets, which produced a significant increase in daily stool weight and a decrease in the intestinal transit time. An abnormal rapid electrical rhythm in colonic smooth muscle was found initially in 80% of the patients, but the incidence was reduced by each treatment after one month; it was present in only 40% of patients after treatment with bran tablets. Only bran significantly reduced a high percentage motility to within normal limits. Bran proved to be the most effective treatment, not only in improving the symptoms in patients with diverticular disease but also in returning to normal the abnormal pathophysiological changes. Bran tablets were both convenient and acceptable as well as effective.
Summary 1: One study found that sterculia gum with an antispasmodic, a high roughage diet, and bran tablets all improved symptomatic diverticular disease, with bran tablets associated with the greatest improvement.

Document 2: To compare the efficacy and tolerance of lactulose (Duphalac) and high-fibre diet in the treatment of symptomatic diverticular disease. Prospectively randomised, parallel groups study over 12 weeks. Patients were seen by their clinician for an initial assessment and then at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Hospital out-patients in the United Kingdom. Forty-three patients with a confirmed diagnosis of diverticular disease were entered into the study. Patients were prospectively randomised to receive lactulose (15 ml bd) or high-fibre diet (30-40 g daily) for 12 weeks. Data were collected using diary cards and physicians' assessments. Bowel frequency and stool consistency improved similarly with both treatments. Pain on bowel movement improved with both treatments in respect of frequency (lactulose: P = 0.017, fibre: P = 0.084) and severity (lactulose: P = 0.028, fibre: P = 0.043). Abdominal pain also improved with both treatments in respect of frequency (lactulose: P = 0.0015, fibre: P = 0.022) and severity (lactulose: P = 0.009, fibre: P = 0.028). Nine patients on lactulose and 12 on fibre reported treatment-emergent symptoms, of which none was serious. Lactulose and high-fibre diet were both shown to be effective in the treatment of diverticular disease, with some differences in favour of lactulose.
Summary 2: A small randomized trial of lactulose vs dietary fiber showed both treatments to be effective in alleviating symptoms of diverticular disease.

Query: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document: Forty patients with diverticular disease were treated with wheat bran 24g/day for at least six months. Thirty-three patients showed a very satisfactory clinical response. Sixty per cent of all symptoms were abolished, and a further 28% were relieved. After treatment the transit times accelerated in patients whose initial times were slower than 60 hours and slowed down in those whose initial transit times were faster than 36 hours. Stool weight increased significantly. The number of intracolonic high pressure waves decreased, especially during and after eating. Barium enema studies showed less spasm in eight patients and no diverticula in three patients after taking bran. As well as relieving the symptoms of diverticular disease a high-fibre diet may also prevent the condition from developing.
Summary:",A small case series of adults treated with dietary fiber found that fiber alleviated symptoms of diverticular disease.

Document 2: To examine the association between dietary fiber, sources of fiber, other nutrients, and the diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 47,888 US men. During 4 y of follow-up we documented 385 new cases of symptomatic diverticular disease. Total dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with the risk of diverticular disease after adjustment for age, energy-adjusted total fat intake, and physical activity [relative risk (RR) 0.58; 95% CI 0.41, 0.83; P for trend = 0.01 for men in the highest as compared with the lowest quintile of dietary fiber]. This inverse association was primarily due to fruit and vegetable fiber. For men on a high-total-fat, low-fiber diet, the RR was 2.35 (95% CI 1.38, 3.98) compared with those on a low-total-fat, high-fiber diet, and for men on a high-red-meat, low-fiber diet the RR was 3.32 (95% CI 1.46, 7.53) compared with those on a low-red-meat, high-fiber diet. These prospective data support the hypothesis that a diet low in total dietary fiber increases the incidence of symptomatic diverticular disease. They also provide evidence that the combination of high intake of total fat or red meat and a diet low in total dietary fiber particularly augments the risk.
Summary 2: One large, prospective study of 47,888 male health professionals gathered baseline dietary information in 1986. In 1990 and 1992, follow-up questionnaires asked the subjects if they had been diagnosed with diverticular disease in the interim, and whether they had symptoms of diverticulitis. The study showed a strong inverse relationship between fruit and vegetable fiber intake and risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. It also demonstrated a direct relationship between fat intake, particularly red meat, and symptomatic diverticular disease. For men in the highest quintile of total fat intake and lowest quintile of total fiber intake, the relative risk (RR) of diverticular disease was 2.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.98) compared with men in the highest quintile of total fiber intake and lowest quintile of total fat intake. Men in the highest group of red meat intake and lowest quintile of fiber intake had a relative risk of 3.22 (95% CI, 1.46-7.54) compared with men with the lowest red meat intake and highest dietary fiber intake. In this study, cereal fiber did not reduce the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease.

Query: What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis?
Document: The management of diverticular disease has altered radically with the widespread use of high fibre diet (HFD) over the past decade. However, whether this regimen has improved the prognosis in patients admitted with acute complications is still debatable. In this study the outcome of 100 such patients admitted to hospital with acute episodes of diverticular disease has been reviewed. Seventy-five per cent were treated conservatively with HFD and review after 5--7 years showed that over 90 per cent remained symptom-free, suggesting that HFD may afford protection by preventing further complications.
Summary:",A small case series of adults treated with dietary fiber found that fiber possibly reduced complications of diverticulosis.

Document: Fifty-eight patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon took bran crispbread, ispaghula drink, and placebo for four months each in a randomised, cross-over, double-blind controlled trial. Assessments were made subjectively, using a monthly self-administered questionnaire, and objectively, by examining a seven-day stool collection at the end of each treatment period. In terms of a pain score, lower bowel symptom score (the pain score and sensation of incomplete emptying, straining, stool consistency, flatus, and aperients taken), and total symptom score (belching, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal distension) fibre supplementation conferred no benefit. Symptoms of constipation, however, when assessed alone, were significantly relieved. Both fibre regimens produced the expected changes in stool weight, consistency, and frequency. It is concluded that dietary fibre supplements in the commonly used doses do no more than relieve constipation. Perhaps the impression that fibre helps diverticular disease is simply a manifestation of Western civilisation's obsession with the need for regular frequent defecation.
Summary:","Another study found no significant differences between psyllium, bran, and placebo in reducing symptomatic diverticular disease."

Query 1: Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer?
Document 1: To evaluate the accuracy of conventional and new methods of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing when used to detect cervical cancer and its precursors. Systematic search of English-language literature through October 1999 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, and hand searching. All studies that compared Pap testing (conventional methods, computer screening or rescreening, or monolayer cytology) with a concurrent reference standard (histologic examination, colposcopy, or cytology). Two reviewers independently reviewed selection criteria and completed 2 x 2 tables for each study. 94 studies of the conventional Pap test and three studies of monolayer cytology met inclusion criteria. No studies of computerized screening were included. Data were organized by cytologic and histologic thresholds used to define disease. For conventional Pap tests, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied greatly in individual studies. Methodologic quality and frequency of histologic abnormalities also varied greatly between studies. In the 12 studies with the least biased estimates, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 87% and specificity ranged from 86% to 100%. Insufficient high-quality data exist to estimate test operating characteristics of new cytologic methods for cervical screening. Future studies of these technologies should apply adequate reference standards. Most studies of the conventional Pap test are severely biased: The best estimates suggest that it is only moderately accurate and does not achieve concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. Cost-effectiveness models of cervical cancer screening should use more conservative estimates of Pap test sensitivity.
Summary 1: A review found insufficient evidence to even judge the new test.

Query 2: Who should have colposcopy?
Document 2: To quantify by meta-analysis the performance of colposcopy to set a standard against which new technologies can be compared. MEDLINE was searched for articles on colposcopy for diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The search selected articles from 1960 to 1996 combining the key word ""colposcopy"" with key words ""diagnosis,"" ""positive predictive value,"" ""negative predictive value,"" ""likelihood ratio,"" and ""receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve."" Articles were selected if the authors studied a population of patients with abnormal screening Papanicolaou smears and presented raw data showing for each cervical lesion type the number of patients judged positive and negative by colposcopic impression versus the standard of colposcopic biopsy results. Nine of 86 studies met these criteria. Biopsies had been categorized as normal, atypia, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, CIN II, CIN III, carcinoma in situ, and invasive cancer; we recalculated performance measures using the Bethesda system. Overall sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, ROC curves, and the corresponding areas under the curves were calculated. The average weighted sensitivity of diagnostic colposcopy for the threshold normal compared with all cervix abnormalities (atypia, low-grade SIL, high-grade SIL, cancer) was 96% and the average weighted specificity 48%. For the threshold normal cervix and low-grade SIL compared with high-grade SIL and cancer, average weighted sensitivity was 85% and average weighted specificity 69%. Likelihood ratios generated small but important changes in probability for distinguishing normal cervix and low-grade SIL from high-grade SIL and cancer. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.80 for the threshold normal cervix compared with all abnormalities and 0.82 for the threshold normal cervix and low-grade SIL compared with high-grade SIL and cancer. Colposcopy compares favorably with other medical diagnostic tests in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve. New diagnostic methods for the cervix can be compared with colposcopy using these quantified values.
Summary 2: Using histology as the gold standard, the sensitivity of colposcopy for cervical abnormalities is high 96%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 95%-97%, but the specificity is much lower 48%; 95% CI, 47%-49%. This low specificity means that more than half of women with no cervical pathology will have an abnormal colposcopy result. The corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios are 2 and 0.1, respectively. Consequently, a normal colposcopy result can effectively rule out cervical pathology, thus supporting its role as a diagnostic rather than a screening tool.

All studies that compared Pap testing (conventional methods, computer screening or rescreening, or monolayer cytology) with a concurrent reference standard (histologic examination, colposcopy, or cytology). Two reviewers independently reviewed selection criteria and completed 2 x 2 tables for each study. 94 studies of the conventional Pap test and three studies of monolayer cytology met inclusion criteria. No studies of computerized screening were included. Data were organized by cytologic and histologic thresholds used to define disease. For conventional Pap tests, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied greatly in individual studies. Methodologic quality and frequency of histologic abnormalities also varied greatly between studies. In the 12 studies with the least biased estimates, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 87% and specificity ranged from 86% to 100%. Insufficient high-quality data exist to estimate test operating characteristics of new cytologic methods for cervical screening. Future studies of these technologies should apply adequate reference standards. Most studies of the conventional Pap test are severely biased: The best estimates suggest that it is only moderately accurate and does not achieve concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. Cost-effectiveness models of cervical cancer screening should use more conservative estimates of Pap test sensitivity.
Summary:","While most lesions are found by abnormal cytology, the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou smear ranges from 30% to 89%."

Query 1: What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination?
Document 1: In January 2005, a tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ([MCV4] Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) was licensed for use among persons aged 11-55 years. CDCns Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of young adolescents (defined in this report as persons aged 11-12 years) with MCV4 at the preadolescent health-care visit (at age 11-12 years). Introducing a recommendation for MCV4 vaccination among young adolescents might strengthen the role of the preadolescent visit and have a positive effect on vaccine coverage among adolescents. For those persons who have not previously received MCV4, ACIP recommends vaccination before high-school entry (at approximately age 15 years) as an effective strategy to reduce meningococcal disease incidence among adolescents and young adults. By 2008, the goal will be routine vaccination with MCV4 of all adolescents beginning at age 11 years. Routine vaccination with meningococcal vaccine also is recommended for college freshmen living in dormitories and for other populations at increased risk (i.e., military recruits, travelers to areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, and patients with terminal complement deficiency). Other adolescents, college students, and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect to receive vaccine. This report updates previous reports from ACIP concerning prevention and control of meningococcal disease. It also provides updated recommendations regarding use of the tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and on antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis.
Summary 1: Using active community surveillance from 1991 to 2002, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data found annual rates of meningococcal disease in the US of 0.5 to 1.1 per 100,000. The highest rates were found in children under age 2. Infants younger than 12 months of age were especially vulnerable (rate 9/100,000), with more than 50% of cases caused by serogroup B.

Query 2: What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination?
Document 2: Neisseria meningitidis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States and worldwide. A serogroup A/C/W-135/Y polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine has been licensed in the United States since 1981 but has not been used universally outside of the military. On 14 January 2005, a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine that covers meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y was licensed in the United States for 11- to 55-year-olds and is now recommended for the routine immunization of adolescents and other high-risk groups. This review covers the changing epidemiology of meningococcal disease in the United States, issues related to vaccine prevention, and recommendations on the use of the new vaccine.
Summary 2: MCV4 is licensed for 11- to 55-year-olds and is the preferred vaccine in this age group, since it provides longer duration of immunity and reduces nasopharyngeal carriage.

Query: What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination?
Document: The US Food and Drug Administration approved a meningococcal conjugate A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine (MCV-4) for use in persons aged 11 to 55 years in January, 2005; licensure for use in younger age groups is expected in 2 to 4 years. To evaluate and compare the projected health and economic impact of MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents, toddlers, and infants. Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective based on data from Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) and other published and unpublished sources. Sensitivity analyses in which key input measures were varied over plausible ranges were performed. A hypothetical 2003 US population cohort of children 11 years of age and a 2003 US birth cohort. Hypothetical routine vaccination of adolescents (1 dose at 11 years of age), toddlers (1 dose at 1 year of age), and infants (3 doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age). Each vaccination scenario was compared with a ""no-vaccination"" scenario. Meningococcal cases and deaths prevented, cost per case prevented, cost per life-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents (11 years of age) would prevent 270 meningococcal cases and 36 deaths in the vaccinated cohort over 22 years, a decrease of 46% in the expected burden of disease. Before program costs are counted, adolescent vaccination would reduce direct disease costs by $18 million and decrease productivity losses by $50 million. At a cost per vaccination (average public-private price per dose plus administration fees) of $82.50, adolescent vaccination would cost society $633000 per meningococcal case prevented and $121000 per life-year saved. Key variables influencing results were disease incidence, case-fatality ratio, and cost per vaccination. The cost-effectiveness of toddler vaccination is essentially equivalent to adolescent vaccination, whereas infant vaccination would be much less cost-effective. Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US children would reduce the burden of disease in vaccinated cohorts but at a relatively high net societal cost. The projected cost-effectiveness of adolescent vaccination approaches that of recently adopted childhood vaccines under conditions of above-average meningococcal disease incidence or at a lower cost per vaccination.
Summary:","Using CDC incidence data, a cost-effectiveness model compared hypothetical vaccination strategies targeting US infants (3 doses), toddlers (1 dose), or 11-year-olds (1 dose). Routine MCV4 vaccination of all 11-year-olds would prevent 270 cases and 36 deaths in this cohort over their next 22 years. For a toddler cohort, vaccination would prevent 385 cases and 33 deaths; for infants, 447 cases and 36 deaths. Conjugate meningococcal vaccines for serogroups A and C have been tested and used in children in other countries, and appear safe and effective, but are not yet available in the US. An application has been submitted for FDA approval of MCV4 for 2- to 10-year-olds."

Query 1: Is pneumococcal vaccine effective in nursing home patients?
Document 1: Pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness was assessed in a randomized trial among 1,686 old people (mean age: 74, standard deviation: 4 years) living in 24 geriatric hospitals and 26 homes for the aged in our district; 937 were vaccinated with Merck-Sharp and Dohme pneumococcal vaccine (14 serotypes). The 749 others composed the reference group. This study was performed during 2 years, since December 1980. Both groups were randomized after a two-criteria stratification: by clinical risk assessed before the study, and by type of homes for the aged. Forty pneumonias were diagnosed, with 13 proved pneumococcal etiology. The incidence of pneumonia was significantly reduced in the vaccinated group (p less than 10(-4) but the mortality rate was not modified. We concluded in favor of the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine: etiological fraction 77.1% (51.2%-89.3% confidence limits, 95% risk) in the population we studied. The incidence of pneumococcal-proved pneumonia was not significantly reduced.
Summary 1: A prospective, risk-stratified, randomized study of the 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine in 1686 patients living in hospices and nursing homes in France showed an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 2.9% in the incidence of all-cause pneumonia, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 35. This study has 2 major limitations: the authors did not comment on whether the study was blinded, and 31% of patients were lost to follow-up.
##
Query 2: Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once?
Document 2: To determine pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine efficacy in selected populations at risk for serious pneumococcal infection for whom vaccination is currently recommended and to assess duration of protection after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was estimated using indirect cohort analysis to compare the proportion of pneumococcal infections caused by serotypes included in the vaccines of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who were identified during 14 years of national surveillance. Hospital laboratories in the United States that submitted pneumococcal isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between May 1978 and April 1992. A total of 2837 persons older than 5 years who had pneumococcus isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Overall efficacy for preventing infection caused by serotypes included in the vaccine was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 66%). Efficacy among persons with diabetes mellitus was 84% (95% CI, 50% to 95%); with coronary vascular disease, 73% (95% CI, 23% to 90%); with congestive heart failure, 69% (95% CI, 17% to 88%); with chronic pulmonary diseases, 65% (95% CI, 26% to 83%); and with anatomic asplenia, 77% (95% CI, 14% to 95%). Efficacy was not documented for patients with alcoholism or cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, although sample sizes were small for these groups. Efficacy for immunocompetent persons older than 65 years was 75% (95% CI, 57% to 85%). Efficacy did not decline with increasing interval after vaccination: 5 to 8 years after vaccination it was 71% (95% CI, 24% to 89%), and 9 years or more after vaccination it was 80% (95% CI, 16% to 95%). Intensified efforts to improve pneumococcal vaccine coverage among certain populations for whom vaccination is currently recommended is indicated, but universal revaccination is not warranted at this time.
Summary 2: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States. An estimated 40,000 people die annually in the US from pneumococcal infections. Even with antibiotic treatment and intensive care unit support, the mortality of patients with pneumococcal bacteremia approaches 25% to 30%.

Query: What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination?
Document: To estimate the extent of meningococcal carriage in the Norwegian population and to investigate the relationship of several characteristics of the population to the carrier state, 1,500 individuals living in rural and small-town areas near Oslo were selected at random from the Norwegian National Population Registry. These persons were asked to complete a questionnaire and to volunteer for a bacteriological tonsillopharyngeal swab sampling. Sixty-three percent of the selected persons participated in the survey. Ninety-one (9.6%) of the volunteers harbored Neisseria meningitidis. The isolates were serogrouped, serotyped, tested for antibiotic resistance, and analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Eight (8.8%) of the 91 isolates represented clones of the two clone complexes that have been responsible for most of the systemic meningococal disease in Norway in the 1980s. Age between 15 and 24, male sex, and active and passive smoking were found to be independently associated with meningococcal carriage in logistic regression analyses. Working outside the home and having an occupation in transportation or industry also increased the risk for meningococcal carriage in individuals older than 17, when corrections for gender and smoking were made. Assuming that our sample is representative of the Norwegian population, we estimated that about 40,000 individuals in Norway are asymptomatic carriers of isolates with epidemic potential. Thus, carriage eradication among close contacts of persons with systemic disease is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall epidemiological situation.
Summary:","Vaccinating adolescents may be particularly helpful for building herd immunity. A Norwegian study of nasopharyngeal meningococcal carriage among 943 unimmunized individuals ages 2 months to 95 years found a carriage rate of 28% among 15- to 24-year-olds, compared with 9.6% overall."

Query 1: What treatments work best for constipation in children?
Document 1: To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG+E) for the treatment of chronic constipation in children. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial, with two 2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week placebo washout. Six UK paediatric departments. 51 children (29 girls, 22 boys) aged 24 months to 11 years with chronic constipation (lasting > or =3 months), defined as < or =2 complete bowel movements per week and one of the following: pain on defaecation on 25% of days; > or =25% of bowel movements with straining; > or =25% of bowel movements with hard/lumpy stools. 47 children completed the double blind treatment. Number of complete defaecations per week (primary efficacy variable), total number of complete and incomplete defaecations per week, pain on defaecation, straining on defaecation, faecal incontinence, stool consistency, global assessment of treatment, adverse events and physical examination. The mean number of complete defaecations per week was significantly higher for children on PEG+E than on placebo (3.12 (SD 2.05) v 1.45 (SD 1.20), respectively; p<0.001). Further significant differences in favour of PEG+E were observed for total number of defaecations per week (p = 0.003), pain on defaecation (p = 0.041), straining on defaecation (p<0.001), stool consistency (p<0.001) and percentage of hard stools (p = 0.001). Treatment related adverse events (all mild or moderate) occurred in similar numbers of children on PEG+E (41%) and placebo during treatment (45%). PEG+E is significantly more effective than placebo, and appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
Summary 1: A recent high-quality randomized controlled trials compared the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E) with placebo in 51 children with CFC, 2 to 11 years of age. The mean number of defecations per week was higher for children on polyethylene glycol + E (3.12 vs 1.45; P<.001); straining or pain and stool consistency improved.

Query 2: What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants?
Document 2: The effect of metoclopramide on gastroesophageal reflux was studied in 30 infants less than 1 year of age. Gastroesophageal reflux was documented in all infants by extended pH monitoring before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg or placebo four times a day, 1/2 hour before feeding for 1 week, followed by the alternate regimen for 1 week. The infants were reevaluated with extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy after 4 to 7 days of each treatment. A symptom score was derived by determining the average number of occurrences of all symptoms recorded daily by parents on a symptom checklist during pretreatment, placebo, and metoclopramide treatment periods. There was a difference between pretreatment evaluation and placebo periods with respect to daily symptom scores (p less than 0.005), reflecting a significant placebo response. However, no difference in scintigraphic study was found between placebo and metoclopramide periods. A significant difference between placebo and metoclopramide periods was noted in the percentage of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0 (p less than 0.001). However, although metoclopramide decreased the proportion of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0, pH remained less than 4.0 for more than 5% of the time in most patients. Substratification of the total group into infants younger and older than 3 months revealed that older infants had greater average daily weight gain during the metoclopramide treatment period (34.3 gm/day) than in the placebo treatment period (6.6 gm/day, p = 0.05). We conclude that metoclopramide in the dosage 0.1 mg/kg four times daily reduces reflux in infants and may be useful for infants with poor weight gain and other serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux.
Summary 2: A small randomized controlled trials of metoclopramide shows significant improvement in reflux index measured by pH probe. However, metoclopramide yielded no improvement in symptom counts.

Query: What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation?
Document: The efficacy of erythromycin was assessed in the treatment of 14 children aged 4 to 13 years with refractory chronic constipation, and presenting megarectum and fecal impaction. A double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover study was conducted at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital. The patients were randomized to receive placebo for 4 weeks followed by erythromycin estolate, 20 mg kg-1 day-1, divided into four oral doses for another 4 weeks, or vice versa. Patient outcome was assessed according to a clinical score from 12 (most severe clinical condition) to 0 (complete recovery). At enrollment in the study and on the occasion of follow-up medical visits at two-week intervals, patient score and laxative requirements were recorded. During the first 30 days, the mean SD clinical score for the erythromycin group (N = 6) decreased from 8.2+/-2.3 to 2.2+/-1.0 while the score for the placebo group (N = 8) decreased from 7.8+/-2.1 to 2.9+/-2.8. During the second crossover phase, the score for patients on erythromycin ranged from 2.9+/-2.8 to 2.4+/-2.1 and the score for the patients on placebo worsened from 2.2+/-1.0 to 4.3+/-2.3. There was a significant improvement in score when patients were on erythromycin (P < 0.01). Mean laxative requirement was lower when patients ingested erythromycin (P < 0.05). No erythromycin-related side effects occurred. Erythromycin was useful in this group of severely constipated children. A larger trial is needed to fully ascertain the prokinetic efficacy of this drug as an adjunct in the treatment of severe constipation in children.
Summary:",A small RCT of 14 children between 4 and 13 years of age showed that erythromycin improved symptoms of constipation and decreased laxative use (number needed to treat [NNT]=10).

Query 1: What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome?
Document 1: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre in irritable bowel syndrome management. To quantify the effect of different types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome. Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using soluble and insoluble fibre separately. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium, ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). The benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases, insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary care.
Summary 1: A systematic review of 17 RCTs (9 of soluble fiber, 8 of insoluble) (N=1363) found soluble fiber more effective than placebo (pooled RR=1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78) for reduction in global symptoms and constipation. Insoluble fiber was no better than placebo (pooled RR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). Abdominal pain was not reduced with either fiber.

Query 2: What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation?
Document 2: The effects of prokinetic treatment with cisapride in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixty-nine IBS patients were assigned to a 12-week treatment with either 5 mg cisapride or placebo t.i.d.; this dosage could be changed if necessary. The mean weekly number of days on which a stool was passed in the cisapride and placebo group increased to 5.3 and 4.4 (p less than 0.05) during weeks 8-12 of treatment, and the number of days with stools of normal consistency increased to 3.5 and 1.9 (p less than 0.05), respectively. At week 12, the reduction in severity and frequency scores for abdominal pain was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) in the cisapride group (60 and 61%) than in the placebo group (40 and 32%), as it was for abdominal distension (p less than 0.05). Cisapride tended to be better than placebo in diminishing flatulence. In 71% versus 39% of the patients the overall rating for the response to treatment was good or excellent at week 12. Cisapride was well tolerated. These results suggest that the drug will be useful for the management of constipation-predominant IBS.
Summary 2: One randomized controlled trials of cisapride for constipation showed that it improved symptoms.

Query: What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation?
Document: Recent research has provided new information about drugs that could be used to treat functional motility disorders. Promotility drugs accelerate gastric emptying or colonic transit and these properties may contribute to their efficacy in treating symptoms associated with gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia or constipation. 5-Hydroxytryptamine4 receptors are targets for drugs (tegaserod, renzapride) that treat symptoms in constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients and in gastroparesis. Drugs acting at motilin (erythromycin) and cholecystokinin-1 (dexloxiglumide) receptors accelerate gastric emptying. Dexloxiglumide might be useful in the treatment of functional dyspepsia particularly that associated with lipid intake. Alvimopan is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier. Alvimopan is effective in treating postsurgical ileus and perhaps opiate-induced bowel dysfunction. Successes and failures of recent efforts to develop promotility agents revealed opportunities and challenges for developing new promotility drugs. The pharmacological properties of partial agonists might be exploited to develop effective promotility drugs. However, opposing actions of promotility agents on motility (increased contraction vs decreased accommodation) limit the clinical efficacy of drugs with these opposing actions. Selection of appropriate patient populations for evaluation of new drugs is also critical.
Summary:","Renzapride, a newer prokinetic similar to cisapride, is under investigation. It is one tenth the strength of cisapride and carries a lower potential risk of cardiac complications."

Query 1: Do abnormal fetal kick counts predict intrauterine death in average-risk pregnancies?
Document 1: Fetal movement counting is a method by which a woman quantifies the movements she feels to assess the condition of the baby. The purpose is to try to reduce perinatal mortality by alerting caregivers when the baby might have become compromised. This method may be used routinely, or only in women who are considered at increased risk of complications in the baby. Some clinicians believe that fetal movement counting is a good method as it allows the clinician to make appropriate interventions in good time. On the other hand, fetal movement counting may cause anxiety to women. To assess outcomes of pregnancy where fetal movement counting was done routinely, selectively or was not done at all; and to compare different methods of fetal movement counting. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library) and the reference lists of relevant papers. Randomised controlled trials. Trials were excluded where allocation concealment was inadequate and no measures were taken to prevent bias were excluded. The interventions included routine fetal movement counting, selective fetal movement counting, and studies comparing different fetal assessment methods. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies and extracted data from studies. Four studies, involving 71,370 women, were included in this review; 68,654 in one cluster-randomised trial. All four trials compared formal fetal movement counting. Two trials compared different types of counting with each other; one with no formal instruction, and one with hormonal analysis. Women in the formal fetal movement counting group had significantly fewer visits to the hospital antenatally than those women randomised to hormone analysis (relative risk (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.35), whereas there were fewer Apgar scores less than seven in five minutes for women randomised to hormone analysis (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.93). There was a significantly higher compliance with the Cardiff 'count to ten' method than with the formal fetal movement counting method (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.32).All other outcomes reported were non significant. This review does not provide enough evidence to influence practice. In particular, no trials compared fetal movement counting with no fetal movement counting. Robust research is needed in this area.

Document 2: A complaint of decreased fetal movements is a common indication for the assessment of fetal well being. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of a group of women whose primary indication for referral was decreased fetal movements. Over a 20 month period, 435 patients were seen in the fetal assessment unit of an inner London teaching hospital, following a primary complaint of reduced fetal movements. Investigations included: the fetal abdominal circumference (AC), amniotic fluid volume (AFV), the umbilical artery pulsatility index (UAPI) derived from Doppler ultrasound waveforms and a computerised analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) recordings or cardiotocograph (CTG). Outcome measures were: gestational age at delivery, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, admission to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), the need for delivery by an emergency cesarean section for fetal compromise (CSFC), and any perinatal deaths. A comparison of actual versus expected outcome for women with decreased fetal movement revealed the following relative risks, with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) in brackets; low 5 minute Apgar score 0.03 vs. 0.05 expected (CI = 0.01, 0.05), SCBU admission, 0.06 vs. 0.07 (0.04, 0.08), and preterm delivery, 0.08 vs. 0.11 (0.05, 0.10). Cesarean sections for fetal compromise, 0.07 vs. 0.053 (0.050-0.096). The addition of FHR monitoring to standard ultrasound assessment of well being did not appear to confer any added benefit. There were no fetal deaths. The outcome for pregnancies where the mother presents with decreased fetal movements in the third trimester is comparable with the outcome for the general population.
Summary 2: A retrospective cohort study of 6793 patients compared pregnancy outcomes of 463 women who presented for evaluation of decreased fetal movement with outcomes among the general obstetric population. The study excluded women who reported complete cessation of fetal movement. Pregnancies evaluated for decreased fetal movement were less likely to have an Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes (relative risk [RR]=0.56; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P=.05) and less likely to be preterm (RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.94; P=.02). No significant difference in cesarean section for fetal distress or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was noted between the study and control groups. The study suggests that maternal perception of decreased fetal movement is not associated with poor fetal outcome.

Document: Fetal death is a tragedy for mother, family, and obstetrician. Recent reviews of fetal death indicate that nearly half occur in pregnancies that are not candidates for traditional antepartum testing. We conducted a prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of a fetal movement screening program in reducing the fetal mortality rate. During a 7-month control period, 2519 deliveries occurred, no formal fetal movement assessment was done, and the fetal mortality rate was 8.7 per 1000 births. A pilot study was conducted to validate a protocol in which the patient was instructed to record the elapsed time required to appreciate 10 fetal movements. The mean time interval was 20.9 +/- 18.1 minutes (mean +/- SD). Patients in whom 2 hours elapsed without 10 fetal movements (mean +/- 5 SD) were to report to the delivery unit for further evaluation. During the study period, 1864 patients were delivered of infants and the fetal mortality rate was 2.1 per 1000 (chi 2 = 6.8, p less than 0.01). During the study period the number of antepartum tests performed increased by 13%. Interventions for fetal compromise prompted by inadequate fetal activity tripled in the study period, resulting in a drop in fetal mortality among patients with decreased movement from 44 to 10 per 1000. We conclude that the count-to-10 fetal movement screening program is simple and effective in reducing the fetal mortality rate.
Summary:","A prospective cohort study of 4383 births in California, using historical controls, found a drop in fetal mortality from 8.7 to 2.1 deaths/1000. The historical control rate was higher than statewide data from the same time period, however. The overall weaker design of the study and probable effect of regression to the mean significantly limit the interpretation of outcomes."

Query 1: Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC?
Document 1: To develop an improved model for the prediction of bacteremia in young febrile children. A retrospective review was performed on patients 3 to 36 months of age seen in a children's hospital emergency department between December 1995 and September 1997 who had a complete blood count and blood culture ordered as part of their regular care. Exclusion criteria included current use of antibiotics or any immunodeficient state. Clinical and laboratory parameters reviewed included age, gender, race, weight, temperature, presence of focal bacterial infection, white blood cell count (WBC), polymorphonuclear cell count (PMN), band count, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with bacteremia, defined as growth of a pathogen in a blood culture. The model that was developed was then validated on a second dataset consisting of febrile patients 3 to 36 months of age collected from a second children's hospital (validation set). There were 633 patients in the derivation set (46 bacteremic) and 9465 patients in the validation set (149 bacteremic). The mean age of patients in the derivation and validation sets were 15.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-16.5) and 16.6 months (95% CI: 16.5-16.8), respectively; the mean temperatures were 39.1 degrees C (95% CI: 39. 0-39.2) and 39.8 degrees C (95% CI: 39.7-39.8); 56% were male in the derivation set and 55% male in the validation set. Predictors of bacteremia identified by logistic regression included ANC, WBC, PMN, temperature, and gender. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed similar performance of ANC and WBC as predictors of bacteremia. When placed into a multivariate logistic regression model, band count was not significantly associated with bacteremia. Information regarding focal infection was available for 572 patients in the derivation set. The percentage of patients diagnosed with bacteremia with a focal bacterial infection was not significantly different from the percentage who had bacteremia without a focal bacterial infection (16/200 vs 30/372). Based on this dataset, a logistic regression formula was developed that could be used to develop a unique risk value for each patient based on temperature, gender, and ANC. When the final model was applied to the validation set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) constructed from these data indicated that the model retained good predictive value (AUC for the derivation vs validation data =.8348 vs 0.8221, respectively). Use of the formulas derived here allows the clinician to estimate a child's risk for bacteremia based on temperature, ANC, and gender. This approach offers a useful alternative to predictions based on fever and WBC alone.bacteremia, detection, white blood cell.
Summary 1: A retrospective review of more than 10,000 patients aged 3 to 36 months presenting to the emergency department used logistic regression to identify predictors of bacteremia. In this study, ANC (>9500/mm3) and white blood cells (>14,300/mm3) were of equal sensitivity (75%) and specificity (75%) in identifying serious bacterial infection.

Document 2: To determine the diagnostic properties of quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) associated with clinically undetectable serious bacterial infection (SBI) in febrile children 1 to 36 months of age. Febrile children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with ages ranging from 1 to 36 months, temperatures > or =39 degrees C, and clinically undetectable source of fever were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Demographic information, ED temperature, duration of fever, and clinical evaluation using the Yale observation scale were recorded at the time of the initial evaluation. The white blood cell count (WBC), band count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and CRP concentration were measured at the same time. All patients received blood cultures and either a screening urinalysis or urine culture. A chest radiograph was obtained at the discretion of the ED physician. Patients with history of using antibiotics within 1 week of their presentation to the ED were excluded. The main outcome result was the presence of laboratory or radiographically proven SBI (bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis). Seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen (18%) had a SBI (6 urinary tract infection; 4 pneumonia, including 1 patient with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia; and 4 occult S pneumoniae bacteremia), and 63 had no SBI. The 2 groups were indistinguishable in age, sex, ED temperature, duration of fever, and Yale observation scale. CRP concentration, WBC, and ANC were significantly different between the 2 groups. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only CRP remained as a predictor of SBI (Beta = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.89). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated CRP (area under curve [AUC] 0.905, standard error [SE] 0.05, 95% CI: 0.808, 1.002) to be superior to ANC (AUC 0.805, SE 0.051, 95% CI: 0.705, 0.905) and to WBC (AUC 0.761, SE 0.068, 95% CI: 0.628, 0.895). A CRP cutoff point of 7 was determined to maximize both sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity 79%, specificity 91%, likelihood ratio 8.3, 95% CI: 3.8, 27.3). Multilevel likelihood ratios and posttest probabilities were calculated for a variety of CRP levels. A CRP concentration of <5 mg/dL effectively ruled out SBI (likelihood ratio 0.087, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.38, posttest probability of SBI 1.9%). Quantitative CRP concentration is a valuable laboratory test in the evaluation of febrile young children who are at risk for occult bacteremia and SBI, with a better predictive value than the WBC or ANC.
Summary 2: A lower prevalence reduces the utility of routine CBC or blood culture in the evaluation of immunized, febrile children. Parameters such as procalcitonin, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and C-reactive protein show future promise as biochemical markers for identifying serious bacterial infections.

Query: Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC?
Document: Occult pneumococcal bacteremia (OPB) occurs in 2.5% to 3% of highly febrile children 3 to 36 months of age, and 10% to 25% of untreated patients with OPB experience complications, including 3% to 6% in whom meningitis develops. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of OPB among a large cohort of young, febrile children treated as outpatients using multivariable statistical methods. We derived and validated a logistic regression model for the prediction of OPB. We evaluated 6,579 outpatients 3 to 36 months of age with temperatures of 39 degrees C or higher who previously had been enrolled in a study of young febrile patients at risk of OPB in the emergency departments of 10 hospitals in the United States between 1987 and 1991; 164 patients (2.5%) had OPB. We randomly selected two thirds of this population for the derivation of the model and one third for validation. In the derivation set, we analyzed the univariate relationships of six variables with OPB: age, temperature, clinical score, WBC count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute band count (ABC). All six variables were then entered into a logistic regression equation and those retaining statistical significance were considered to have an independent association with OPB. Patients with OPB were younger, more frequently ill-appearing, and had higher temperatures, WBC, ANC, and ABC than patients without bacteremia. Only three variables, however, retained statistically significant associations with OPB in the multivariate analysis: ANC (Adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.15 for each 1,000 cells/mm3 increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06, 1.25), temperature (adjusted OR 1.77 for each 1 degree C increase, 95% CI 1.21, 2.58), and age younger than 2 years (adjusted OR 2.43 versus patients 2 to 3 years old, 95% CI interval 1.11, 5.34). In the derivation set, 8.1% of patients with ANCs greater than or equal to 10,000 cell/mm3 had OPB (95% CI 6.3, 10.1%) versus .8% of patients with ANCs less than 10,000 cells/mm3 (95% CI .5, 1.2%). When tested on the validation set, the model performed similarly. Independent predictors of OPB in children 3 to 36 months of age with temperatures of 39 degrees C or higher treated as outpatients include ANC, temperature, and age younger than 2 years. These predictors may be used to develop clinical strategies to limit laboratory testing and antibiotic administration to those children at greatest risk of OPB.
Summary:","A review of 6579 outpatients aged 3 to 36 months presenting to the emergency department with temperatures of 39ºC or higher showed an ANC of >10,000/mm3 as more predictive of occult pneumococcal bacteremia than an elevated WBC count (>15,000/mm3) alone."
